The informal setting sparked a lot of new ideas that are now on the roadmap.\\n\u2022 Open storytelling: Several teammates have shared aspects of their backgrounds or personal lives during \u201cShow & Tell\u201d lightning talks.

During your first project kickoff, ask the team to establish \u201cworking agreements\u201d (preferred communication style, core hours, review expectations).
