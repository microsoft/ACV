Hi Maria,

Below is the latest summary of the confirmed marketing-side action items for [Project Name].

I did not see any new messages in the Gmail thread titled “Action Items – [Project Name]”; the most recent message in that thread appears to be from last week, and no additional changes were logged there. I therefore pulled the current tasks from the Notion page located under Marketing › [Project Name] › Workflow (the page is titled “Marketing Project Action Items”).

Confirmed steps, owners & due dates
1. Finalise ad copy – Due 5 Mar (Copy team – owner TBC)
2. Secure media placements – Due 15 Mar (PR/Media – owner TBC)
3. Schedule social-media posts to start – Start 20 Mar (Social team – owner TBC)
4. Prepare marketing team for product-launch event – Due 1 Apr (Events/Marketing – owner TBC)
5. Coordinate with Sales to align strategies – Ongoing through launch (Marketing & Sales leads)

If anything needs tweaking—owners, dates, or additional tasks—let me know and I can adjust right away. Otherwise feel free to drop this straight into your outgoing email.

Best,
John
