Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for outlining the data MarketMinds needs.

I’ll open the “Marketing Analytics – 2024 > MarketMinds Data Requests” space this afternoon, double-check that the notes titled “Q1–Q2 Engagement Metrics” reflect our most current figures, and then pull the requested aggregates:
• Monthly new-account openings & closures (Jan–May 2024)
• Average customer tenure & churn rate for the same period
• Quarterly NPS trend (Q3 ’23 – Q2 ’24)
• Top 5 digital-banking features by usage (%)
• Active-customer demographics by age band & region

My plan is to export the dataset to .xlsx and place it in the secure ShareFile folder linked at the top of the page. I’ll send you a quick confirmation (or attach the file) once the upload is complete—well before end-of-day Thursday, 13 June.

If anything changes on your side—additional metrics, a different file format, etc.—just let me know.

Best regards,
Jane
