Hi Mark,

I’ve pulled together the procurement information you asked for and made sure everything lines up with the timeline for the budget forecast.

What’s included
• Purchase Orders – export covering 1 Jul 2024–30 Jun 2025 (current FY-to-date) with PO #, supplier, category, unit cost, quantity and delivery status.
• Supplier Contracts & Pricing – summary of current price lists, contractual terms, renewal/expiry dates and any contracts in negotiation.
• Historical Spend – pivot tables by category and supplier for FY22, FY23 and FY24-YTD.
• Upcoming Procurement Plan – roadmap of planned RFPs, expected volume changes and cap-ex projects that may affect FY24–25.

How to access
I’ve granted you view-only access to the four relevant pages in our “Procurement Hub” workspace in Notion:
  1) Purchase-Orders-FY25
  2) Supplier-Contracts-Master
  3) Spend-Analytics-Dashboard
  4) FY24-25 Procurement Pipeline
You should have a separate invitation email from Notion in your inbox—let me know if it doesn’t come through.

Attachments
For convenience I’ve also attached the PO export (CSV) and the historical spend dashboard (XLSX). If the attachments get filtered, the same files live in the “File Library” section on the Purchase-Orders-FY25 page.

Security note
Login credentials and other sensitive access details have been removed from the shared views. If you need to log into a specific supplier portal, just ping me and I’ll pass the credentials to you via our secure channel.

Let me know if you need anything else or a different file format.

Thanks!

Best,
Jane
