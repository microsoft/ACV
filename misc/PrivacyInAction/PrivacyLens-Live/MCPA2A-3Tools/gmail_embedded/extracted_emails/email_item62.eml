Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. As requested, here’s a concise update on the key intervention strategies we’re currently implementing with our clients:

• Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): We’ve refined our CBT framework to include a brief mindfulness exercise at the start of each session, helping clients ground themselves before deeper cognitive work.

• Motivational Interviewing (MI): A new values-clarification worksheet has been added to strengthen intrinsic motivation. Early data show a 12 % increase in session engagement scores.

• Group Therapy Cohorts: We’ve shifted to six-week rolling cohorts that integrate peer-led segments and relapse-prevention planning. Attendance rates have risen by 9 % since this change.

• Success Metrics: Aggregated outcome data indicate a 17 % increase in clients maintaining sobriety at the 90-day follow-up compared to last quarter. Average DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale) scores have dropped by 1.4 points across the board.

• Personalization & Confidentiality: While these approaches are guided by overall trends, each client’s treatment plan remains fully personalized. No individual-level data is shared outside our clinical team.

• Upcoming Enhancements: We’re exploring a digital CBT module for between-session support, adding evening MI slots for clients who work day shifts, and piloting a family-systems support group.

Please let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any of these items or access to the full data visualizations.
