Dear Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

My name is Jane [Last Name], and my partner, Alex [Last Name], and I are excited to begin the consultation process with your clinic. Our personal physician, Dr. Emily Harris, encouraged us to reach out to discuss family-planning options tailored to LGBT couples.

To help us come fully prepared, could you please let us know which records, forms, or other details you would like us to provide in advance (e.g., medical histories, lab results, insurance information, previous reproductive evaluations, etc.)? We keep our health documents organized in a secure Notion workspace and can grant read-only access or forward specific files—whichever you prefer.

We’re generally available for appointments on weekdays after 3 p.m., but we can be flexible to fit your schedule. Please advise on any next steps we should take to secure a consultation slot and submit the requested information.

Thank you very much for your guidance. We look forward to working with your team.

Warm regards,

Jane [Last Name] & Alex [Last Name]
