Hi Mark,

Happy to help. Below is an updated, consolidated overview of Union Trust Bank’s dispute-resolution programme. I’ve woven in the items you asked about and flagged colleagues you’re welcome to quote or contact for follow-up.

1.  End-to-End Workflow
    • Customer lodges a complaint or disputed transaction through any of three entry points – secure online portal, 24/7 phone centre, or in-branch form.
    • Case-creation bot assigns a unique reference number and auto-acknowledgement email/SMS within <30 minutes.
    • Front-line Resolution (Tier 1)
        – Agent validates identity, gathers evidence, and logs issue details in CRM.
        – Straight-forward billing errors or fee-reversals are resolved on the call/chat whenever possible.
    • Specialist Review (Tier 2)
        – If the issue involves alleged fraud, merchant disputes, or amounts ≥ $500, the file is routed to the Disputes & Chargebacks Desk.
        – Desk contacts the merchant, retrieves receipts, and analyses network data (Visa/Mastercard Reg E/R.
        – Provisional credit is applied to the customer’s account within 10 business days when required by Reg E.
    • Compliance Escalation (Tier 3)
        – Unresolved or complex cases (>15 BD, regulatory risk, or customer appeals) are escalated to the Office of Customer Advocacy & Compliance (OCAC).
        – OCAC may engage our external ombudsman service for independent review.
    • Resolution & Close-out
        – Final decision emailed and posted to the secure portal. Any credits/debits are applied same-day.
        – Customer receives a satisfaction-survey link; findings feed our QA scorecard.

2.  Typical Timelines & Internal SLAs
    • Initial acknowledgement: ≤ 30 min (actual avg. 7 min in Q1-2024).
    • Tier 1 resolution target: 5 business days (met 91 % of the time; avg. 2.8 days).
    • Tier 2 resolution target: 15 business days; provisional credit by day 10 if still under review (met 94 %).
    • Tier 3/ombudsman: 35 calendar days statutory limit; we average 21 days.

3.  Escalation Path
    • Tier 1 Agent → Tier 2 Disputes Desk if: fraud indicators, merchant challenge, legal documentation required, or amount ≥ $500.
    • Tier 2 Desk → OCAC if: customer formally appeals, evidence is contradictory, or investigation exceeds 15 BD.
    • OCAC → Independent Ombudsman where impasse persists or customer requests external review.

4.  Customer Touchpoints
    • Auto-acknowledgement (email/SMS).
    • Mid-investigation status update at day 5 and day 10 (email + optional secure-portal message).
    • Phone outreach whenever additional documentation is needed.
    • Final resolution letter (email + downloadable PDF in portal) and optional follow-up call for Tier 3 cases.

5.  Key Metrics We Track (2023-YTD)
    • Avg. resolution time: 4.2 business days.
    • % closed at Tier 1: 82 % | Tier 2: 15 % | Tier 3/Ombudsman: 3 %.
    • Re-open rate within 60 days: 2.1 %.
    • Top dispute categories: Unauthorized card activity (38 %), duplicate/incorrect merchant charges (24 %), ATM cash-dispense errors (19 %), fee grievances (13 %), other (6 %).

6.  Recent Policy / Regulatory Changes
    • July 2023 – CFPB interpretive rule on “reasonable investigation” for P2P transfers; we tightened evidence-collection checklists and expanded provisional-credit coverage to Zelle-type rails.
    • January 2024 – Internal policy UTB-DR-24-01 shortened Tier 1 SLA from 7 BD to 5 BD and introduced the day-5 status-update requirement.
    • March 2024 – Launched customer-facing dispute tracker in the mobile app; early data show a 12 % drop in status-inquiry calls.

7.  Colleagues for Attribution / Deep-Dive

Attachments / Earlier Threads
    For completeness, I’m forwarding the internal outline I shared with our team in Nov-2021 (subject: “Union Trust Bank Dispute Resolution Process”), which still aligns with the above but lacks the 2023-24 updates.

Let me know if any definitions or data points need deeper context. I can also arrange a quick call or supply anonymised case studies if helpful.

Best,
