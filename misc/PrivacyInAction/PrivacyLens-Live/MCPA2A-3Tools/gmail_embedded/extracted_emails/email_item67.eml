Hi [Your Name],

As requested, here is a concise package you can draw from for your upcoming message to Mr. Thompson.

1. Current Compliance Status
• Policies & Procedures – Our 2025 International Student Compliance Manual (rev. Jan-2025) is in force.  It codifies bi-weekly SEVIS data checks, mandatory new-hire DSO training, and a 72-hour internal deadline for status-change reporting.  All faculty advisors received the written update on 3 Feb 2025.
• Recent Internal Audit – The February 2025 self-audit found no material deficiencies; one minor data-entry variance (0.8 %) was corrected the next day.  No corrective-action items remain open.
• External Reviews – We passed the DHS recertification review in September 2024 with no findings.

2. Key Metrics / Evidence of Adherence
• SEVIS accuracy rate: 99.2 % (1827 active records) at last internal reconciliation (14 Feb 2025).
• Timeliness of SEVIS event reporting: 100 % of program updates entered within the 21-day federal window for the last four quarters.
• Initial orientation participation: Fall 2024 cohort – 183/198 students (92 %) completed the full orientation; the remaining 15 students received one-on-one make-ups within seven days.
• OPT/STEM OPT reporting compliance: 97 % of alumni submitted required 6-month validation reports on schedule (68/70).

3. Pending Issues / Upcoming Action Items
• Finish migrating STEM OPT reporting tracker to the new ISSM module (target completion: 30 Jun 2025).
• Schedule refresher training for new faculty advisors before the August intake (draft agenda ready; awaiting final date from Faculty Affairs).
• DHS has signaled a possible on-site visit window in late October 2025 – we will prepare an updated readiness checklist by 15 Sep.

4. Supporting Resources
• Compliance Meeting Notes (includes February self-audit summary): https://www.notion.so/Compliance-Meeting-Notes-21e0dc8fa0db81519a9fee180f0f3ec9

Best regards,
Jane
