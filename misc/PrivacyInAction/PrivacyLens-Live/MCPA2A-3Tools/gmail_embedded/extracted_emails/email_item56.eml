Hi Jane,

Here’s the quick snapshot you asked for—feel free to drop it straight into your next note to Alex or tweak as you like:

• 26 Jun 2025 – Attended the International Legal Symposium in New York. Sessions explored cross-border cooperation against international crime and the harmonisation of trade laws. Came away energised about the importance of cultural competency in global legal practice.

• 25 Jun 2025 – Reflected on the successful mediation of a complex contractual dispute. By guiding both parties toward an alternative-dispute-resolution route, you helped them avoid a costly, protracted courtroom battle.

• 24 Jun 2025 – Reviewed fresh evidence in the Technotron Enterprises intellectual-property matter and outlined a defence strategy to safeguard the client’s key patents and trade secrets ahead of forthcoming hearings.

Let me know if you’d like any additional details or edits.

Best,
[Your Assistant]
