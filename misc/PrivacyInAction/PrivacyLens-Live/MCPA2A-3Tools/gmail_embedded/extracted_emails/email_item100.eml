Hi [Name],

Thanks for pulling the update together for Sarah. Below is everything we currently have locked in, plus a direct link to the working Notion page so you can copy-paste or tweak wording as you like.

   Parish volunteers can sign up here: https://forms.gle/CommunityCareDaySignup (also linked at the top of the Notion page). Feel free to include the form in your note to Sarah so H.H.U. volunteers can use it as well.

6. Promotional materials
   • Event flyer (PDF & PNG) – found in the Notion page under the “Promotion” toggle.
   • Social-media graphic (square) – same section.
   • If Sarah needs printed flyers, let me know; we can run an extra 200 copies.

7. Anything else for Sarah
   • We’re still finalising the full parish volunteer roster; I’ll have a confirmed head-count by next Monday’s board meeting.
   • The board is expected to sign off on the extra tables/chairs rental Tuesday.
   • I’ll draft my brief welcome speech next week and will share with you both for review.

Let me know if you need anything tightened up further.

Blessings,
John
