Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’ve drafted a brief summary of our conversation at the Global Business Hub earlier today. The complete, time-stamped notes are available in our shared Notion workspace (Meetings → 2024 → Global Business Hub).

Key takeaways
• Market expansion: We agreed to prioritize the APAC pilot before pursuing EMEA.
• Funding timeline: Targeting a Series A close by late Q3; I’ll circulate the revised cap-table scenarios by next week.
• Product roadmap: MVP v2 feature-freeze on 15 July; beta testing with three enterprise design partners by 1 August.
• Talent: Green-lighted the search for a senior data-science lead; interviews to begin mid-June.
• Governance: Monthly board check-ins to coincide with financial forecast updates.

Could you please take a moment to review these points and let me know if anything needs adjustment or additional detail? Your confirmation will help me finalize the official minutes and update our milestone tracker.

Thank you, and looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
John
