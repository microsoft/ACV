Hi Mark,

Here’s a quick status update on the candidates we currently have in the pipeline for the engineering opening:

1. Tom Davis – 10+ years of software-development experience at GlobalSoft and InnoTech. Solid technical interview performance and strong references. Currently finishing up reference verification; should be complete this week.

2. Susan Lee – M.S. in Computer Science (MIT) with five years at FastTech focusing on AI/ML projects. Impressed the panel with her systems-design exercise. Scheduling final-round interview with leadership for early next week.

3. Raj Patel – Senior engineer with roughly 10 years in cybersecurity roles at CyberNet and SecureTech. Demonstrated deep expertise in secure coding practices during his technical screen. Awaiting coding-exercise results, expected tomorrow.

Next steps:
• I’ll confirm Tom’s references and, assuming everything checks out, prepare an offer discussion.
• Susan’s final-round interview panel is being finalized; calendar invite going out today.
• Raj’s coding-exercise review meeting is set for Friday.

Let me know if you’d like any additional details or adjustments to the timeline.

Best,
Jane
