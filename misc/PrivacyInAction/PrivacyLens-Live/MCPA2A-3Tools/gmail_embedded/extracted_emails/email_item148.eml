Hi [Name],

Below is the latest snapshot you asked for on our joint Community Health Initiative with Helping Hands. Feel free to copy-paste or adapt for your update to Sarah.

1. Key milestones since the last report (April):
   • Screening events – 2 completed
        – Eastwood Community Center (May 18): 87 residents screened (BP, BMI, A1C/glucose)
        – Rivertown Library (June 22): 100 residents screened
   • Outreach/education – 3 interactive workshops
        – "Heart-Healthy Eating" (avg. 42 attendees)
        – "Managing Chronic Conditions" (39 attendees)
        – "Family Fitness Fun Day" (58 participants)
   • Volunteer pipeline – 25 new volunteers trained (see Volunteer Coordination page for roster & training slide-deck)
   • Milestone delivery – We are at ~70 % of the Q1 targets outlined in the Strategic Plan (Notion › Health Initiative Q1 Review).

2. Notable outcomes/metrics:
   • 23 % of screened participants had elevated BP and were referred to CHC partner clinics; follow-up calls scheduled.
   • 15 high-risk individuals enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program.
   • Self-reported knowledge gain (post-workshop surveys): 4.7 / 5 average.
   • Social media reach for event promos up 38 % over previous quarter.

3. Upcoming activities & timelines:
   • Jul 15 – Free Immunization & Wellness Day (venue confirmed; flyer draft in Notion)
   • Aug 10 – Healthy Cooking Demonstration with local chefs
   • Sep (TBD) – Third mobile screening clinic targeting Meadowbrook neighborhood
   • Resources needed:
        – 10 additional volunteers for July/Aug events
        – ~$1,500 for testing supplies & educational handouts
        – Design support for Spanish-language promo materials

4. Tom’s status & follow-up:
   • Tom (Health for All) was recently diagnosed with mild hypertension. He’s scaling back field hours and will focus on data entry/analysis remotely.
   • Next medical review is set for Jul 12; we’ll reassess workload afterward.
   • No anticipated delays to deliverables — roles have been redistributed among volunteers.

5. Other highlights:
   • Secured verbal commitment of $5k in supplemental funding from RiverBank Credit Union (formal letter expected next week).
   • Local news outlet "CityHealth Weekly" will feature the initiative in their Jul 20 issue – interview completed.

Let me know if you’d like any additional detail or backup docs. Happy to jump on a quick call if that helps.

Best,
John
