Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m putting together our next progress summary for the individuals we’re supporting together and want to be sure it reflects the most current information from your side.

When you have a moment, could you please:
• Review the latest notes in our shared Notion workspace  
• Add or comment on any recent observations, needs, or changes you’ve noticed  
• Flag anything you’d like me to emphasize in the upcoming update

If email is easier, feel free to reply here instead. Either way, a brief update from you by the end of the week would be wonderful.

Thanks so much for your help, and for all you’re doing for the community!

Warm regards,

John
