Hi [Your Name],

I reviewed both my Gmail correspondence and my working notes in Notion. Here is what I could confirm:

1. Official Announcements
• I did not find any recent (past 12 months) Executive Board or HR circulars announcing a new restructuring, policy update, or organizational change.
• The only materials in my mailbox that reference a restructuring are two draft emails from February 2022:
   – "Confidential: Restructuring Plan Draft" from the Executive Board (10 Feb 2022)
   – "Your Input Required: Restructuring Proposal" from the external consulting team (07 Feb 2022)
  Those drafts were part of a scenario-planning exercise at the time and were never finalized or rolled out.

2. Timelines / Milestones
• Because nothing new has been formally approved, there are no current dates or milestones on record.
• I have no Board minutes, slide decks, or town-hall invites in my email or Notion that point to upcoming announcements.

3. Guidance for Project Teams
• We can reassure teams that there is no active restructuring underway.
• Encourage them to stay focused on existing project deliverables and to escalate any specific concerns to HR so we can address them quickly.
• Let them know that, should anything change, leadership will communicate through the usual channels (all-hands meeting and formal HR notice) before any modifications take effect.

If Mark needs further reassurance, I’m happy to speak with him directly or join your reply. I’ll also keep monitoring my channels and will flag you immediately if something official surfaces.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
Jane
