Hi Mark,

Happy to help! Below are the key resources that capture what I tried this term and the results we’ve seen:

1. Engagement Techniques (Notion): https://www.notion.so/Engagement-Techniques-20f0dc8fa0db8108b4d5cf1e1cee6759
   • Opens with a concise list of the three core practices I relied on:
     – Opening class with a thought-provoking question
     – Tying theory to fresh, real-world examples each week
     – Rotating student-led discussion segments

2. Class Participation Rates (Notion): https://www.notion.so/Class-Participation-Rates-20f0dc8fa0db814e9232c6c7f0885fd9
   • Shows a 15 % uptick in participation after we started weekly discussion prompts and peer-review sessions.

3. Historical context: There’s a short email thread between us from 21 Feb 2022 (subject: “Student Engagement Strategies”) where we brainstormed early ideas. It might be useful to revisit as you compile approaches.

If you need anything beyond these—for instance my quick reflection notes on using anonymous polls or mid-semester “temperature check” surveys—let me know and I can add them to Notion.

Hope this speeds up your project!

Best,
Jane
