Hi Ethan,

Hope you’re well. As promised, here’s the complete cover design brief for Clara Bellamy’s upcoming novel, along with links to the reference files you’ll need.

BOOK COVER DESIGN BRIEF – “Whispers of the Past”

Overall feel
• Evoke an immediate sense of mystery and nostalgia
• Mood should lean toward quietly eerie rather than overtly gothic

Key visual elements
• An old, ornate key (central focal point)
• A faded, partially-unfolded letter (secondary element – can be tucked behind the key or integrated into the background)

Colour palette
• Muted earth tones: weathered sepia, mossy green, soft charcoal, hints of antique gold
• Avoid bright or saturated colours – the effect should look time-worn

Typography
• Title: elegant serif with subtle distressing / texture
• Author name: clean small-caps sans serif or slab serif for contrast
• Keep legibility high in thumbnails

Layout notes
• Portrait trim: 6 × 9 in. (with 0.125 in. bleed all around)
• Leave safe area for spine width TBD once final page count is locked, but assume ~0.8 in. for now

Inspirational references (see links below)
• 1920s stationery textures
• Vintage skeleton keys in brushed brass
• Old family letters with frayed edges

Deliverables
1. 3 initial front-cover concepts (JPG + layered PSD or AI)
2. After feedback: 1 refined concept + full-spread mock-up including spine & back cover copy placeholder
3. Final print-ready PDF + packaged source files (PSD/AI + linked images & fonts)

Timeline
• Initial concepts due: Friday, 6 October
• Final files target: Monday, 30 October
