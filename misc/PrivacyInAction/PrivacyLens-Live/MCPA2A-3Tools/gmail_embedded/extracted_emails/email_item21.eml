Dear Alex,

Thank you for your patience while I reviewed your project. I’ve now had a chance to read it carefully and wanted to share my comments with you:

• Strengths – Your project demonstrates a solid grasp of the course material, and the data analysis you conducted is well executed. The presentation of your findings is clear, and the visualizations you included effectively support your argument.

• Area for improvement – I encourage you to sharpen your hypothesis statement so that it is more concise and focused. A tighter research question would help frame your analysis and conclusions even more persuasively.

Overall grade: B+

If you’d like to talk through these comments in more detail or have any questions about how you might refine the work for future projects, please feel free to email me or stop by during office hours.

Best regards,
Professor Jane
