Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out and for continuing to shine a light on the experiences of our immigrant neighbors. Below is a concise overview you can use as a starting point; let me know if you’d like deeper dives, additional data, or introductions.

Top issues that deserve more attention
1. Legal vulnerability and family separation
   • Undocumented residents still face a serious shortage of affordable, trustworthy legal help.  At our monthly information clinic the wait-list has doubled since January.
   • Several families have been split up after recent workplace enforcement actions; one father (pseudonym “John”) is now juggling two jobs while fighting a removal order so he can stay with his children who are U.S. citizens.

2. Barriers to health and mental-health care
   • Fear of the public-charge rule, lack of insurance, and language gaps keep many people away from doctors.  In our spring intake survey, 42 % of respondents reported postponing needed medical visits in the last year.
   • “Maria,” who fled gender-based violence, delayed cancer screening for months because she worried a hospital bill would expose her status.  She finally received low-cost care after we accompanied her to a partner clinic, but the delay underscores the stakes.

3. Economic & educational hurdles that reinforce food insecurity
   • Exclusion from most federal aid and the prevalence of cash-only, low-wage work make it hard for families to stay afloat and for young adults to pursue higher education (e.g., “Li,” a straight-A student who had to defer college when she couldn’t access in-state tuition or aid).
   • Our Nourish Neighbors food-security program distributed 2,500 meals to more than 50 families last month alone, yet demand continues to outpace supply.

Recent data / success snapshots
• Legal Aid Pop-Up: 120 people screened during a single Saturday clinic in April; 30 have since filed for U- or T-visa relief with pro-bono counsel.
• Nourish Neighbors: 2,500 meals in May; 70 % of recipients were first-time visitors, indicating widening need.
• Youth Scholarship Pilot: six DACA-eligible students secured private scholarships this semester after our college-prep workshops.

People, orgs & events worth talking to
• Harmony Alliance (happy to arrange interviews with our program leads).
• “Unity in Action” cultural festival – June 24, Riverside Park – grass-roots organizers representing 15 nationalities.
• DACA Youth Coalition (student-led): weekly meetings at Lincoln Library, Thurs 6 p.m.
• Refugee Health Network – Dr. Elena Ruiz can speak to community-clinic data.
• Citywide Immigrant Legal Defense Fund steering committee – quarterly public meetings at City Hall (next one July 7).

If you’d like direct contact details or introductions, just say the word—I can secure permission and loop everyone in quickly.

Thanks again for covering this.  Let me know what else would be helpful.

Warmly,
Jane
