Hi Analytics Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m collaborating with Sarah Thompson from AdVantage Media on our upcoming marketing campaign and need a concise set of customer insights to share with her as soon as possible.

Could you please pull together the following by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?

1. Top three customer segments (age, income band, primary banking needs)
2. Recent purchasing or product-adoption trends for each segment (last 6 months)
3. Channel-usage breakdown (mobile app, online banking, branch, call center)
4. Key pain points or common support topics gathered from recent CS tickets/NPS surveys
5. Any notable cross-sell or upsell opportunities you’ve identified

You can reference:
• The “Customer Analytics” folder in Notion (last updated Q2)
• The June VOC survey results in Gmail (search subject line: “VOC Results – June 2024”)
• The “2024 Product Adoption” dashboard on Looker

If possible, please provide the data in a brief slide deck or one-page summary so I can forward it directly to Sarah.

Thank you very much for the quick turnaround—let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
John
