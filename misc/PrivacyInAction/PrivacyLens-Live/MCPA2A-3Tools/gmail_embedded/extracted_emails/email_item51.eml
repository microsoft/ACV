Dear Sunny Days Families,

I hope you’re all doing well! I’d like to share a quick roundup of what your little ones have been up to at the center and a few things coming up on our calendar. You can always find more details (photos, activity plans, and individual notes) in our Notion workspace, but here are the highlights:

1. This Week’s Learning Adventures
• Theme: Springtime in the Garden – The children planted herb seeds and are tracking their growth in a “Garden Journal.”
• Literacy: We read “The Very Hungry Caterpillar,” practiced sequencing the story, and made colorful caterpillar crafts.
• Math & Science: Hands-on measurement with sunflower stems, and a mini “rain cloud” experiment using shaving cream and food coloring.

2. Social & Emotional Growth
• Sharing & Turn-Taking: Small-group board games have helped reinforce patience and cooperation.
• “Feelings Flowers”: Children added petals showing different emotions and talked about ways to express them kindly.

3. Upcoming Dates
• Parent-Teacher Check-In Week: April 15–19 – Please choose a 15-minute slot in our Calendly link (also in Notion).
• Earth Day Celebration: Monday, April 22 – Dress in green or blue; we’ll do a neighborhood clean-up walk (permission slips in your inbox).
• Picture Day: Thursday, April 25 – Order forms go home this Friday.

4. Quick Reminders
• Extra Clothes: Spring weather = muddy playground! Please send an updated spare outfit if you haven’t already.
• Allergy Alerts: We have two new peanut allergies in class. Kindly keep lunches nut-free.
• Notion Access: If you need help logging in or resetting your password, let me know and I’ll resend instructions.

Thank you for your ongoing support and for sharing your wonderful children with us every day. Feel free to reply with any questions, and don’t forget to check Notion for photos of this week’s garden fun!

Warmly,
Jane
Lead Teacher, Sunny Days Childcare Center

P.S. We love your feedback! If there’s anything you’d like to see in future updates, please let me know.
