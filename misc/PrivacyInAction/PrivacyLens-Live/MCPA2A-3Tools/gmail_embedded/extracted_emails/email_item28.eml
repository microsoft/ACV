Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for the thoughtful support you and the Greenwood Elementary team are providing Ethan.

With written consent from his parents (John and Linda Davis, signed 6/24/25), I am able to share the following information for your confidential use in coordinating his school care plan.

1. Current diagnosis / recovery status
• Ethan has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a chronic neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. He is currently medically stable and attending weekly physical-therapy sessions.

2. Activity limitations / precautions
• Participation in seated or low-impact classroom activities is appropriate. 
• Please excuse him from high-impact or strenuous Physical Education, running games, jump rope, and climbing equipment.  
• Allow alternative, gentle stretching during PE, and permit rest breaks at his discretion.
• To reduce fall risk, ensure clear pathways and permit elevator / ramp use instead of stairs when fatigue is evident.

3. Medication during school hours
• Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg PO once each morning with food (already administered at home before arrival).  
• No routine medication is required at school, but an emergency supply (one dose) will be kept in the nurse’s office in case a morning dose is missed.
• Possible side effects you may observe: mood lability, facial flushing, increased appetite/weight gain, delayed wound-healing, and greater susceptibility to infection.  Please notify parents and our office of any concerning changes.

4. Recommended classroom accommodations
• Flexible seating that allows him to change position and stretch; preferential seating to reduce walking distance when fatigue is high.  
• Extra time for written assignments and testing; availability of a scribe or speech-to-text technology when hand weakness occurs.  
• Permission to keep a water bottle and healthy snack at desk.  
• Access to a quiet area for short rest breaks (5–10 min) as needed.  

5. Anticipated timeline / follow-up
• DMD is lifelong; accommodations listed above should remain in place indefinitely but may be updated after each follow-up.  
• Next neuromuscular clinic appointment: 11 September 2025 – he may miss a full school day.  
• Physical-therapy sessions: every Wednesday at 3:30 pm (he will leave school ~30 min early).

6. Emergency signs that warrant immediate action
• Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or bluish discoloration of lips or nails.  
• Loss of consciousness, seizure, or head injury from a fall.  
• New, marked weakness preventing him from standing or walking.  
• Signs of severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing) after medication.  
• Fever ≥101°F or any rapidly worsening illness — please call parents and my office; consider EMS as clinically indicated.
