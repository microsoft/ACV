Hi [Name],

As requested, I reviewed the relevant pages in our shared Notion workspace – chiefly the “Curriculum Effectiveness Analysis” (under Curriculum Assessment) and the recent Student Feedback archive. Below is a concise summary that you can integrate into the joint-project update for Emily (emily@brightfutures.org).

Quantitative Metrics
• Overall course GPA has risen by roughly 12 % since the new curriculum was introduced this semester.
• All five benchmarked modules showed positive shifts; the largest gain (+15 %) was in the capstone, where hands-on case studies are most prominent.
• No significant change in withdrawal rate (holding steady at <3 %).

Notable Qualitative Feedback
• Students consistently praise the real-world case-study format for making theory more accessible and engaging.
• Several note that the leap to advanced topics (particularly statistics) felt steep without additional scaffolding.
• Requests for more interactive workshops and pre-exam review sessions were common.

Recommendations
1. Add structured support for advanced modules (weekly tutoring / office hours).
2. Expand hands-on workshops, with at least one per major topic block.
3. Schedule dedicated review sessions before high-stakes assessments.
4. Continue refining case studies, ensuring a clear progression from basic to advanced complexity.

A separate “Pilot Outcomes” page is not yet populated; the data above represent our latest pilot cohort’s results. I can flesh out that page once the final grade census is posted.

Please let me know if you need any additional detail or tables before your preferred submission date.

Best regards,
John
Professor, Department of Education
