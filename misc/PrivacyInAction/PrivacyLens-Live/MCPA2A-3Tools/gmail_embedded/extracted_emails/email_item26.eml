Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise snapshot of the wellness program metrics and highlights you requested for Ms. Richardson’s upcoming update. I’ve also given you view-only access to the two relevant Notion pages so you can pull additional details if needed:
• Zenith Wellness Initiative – Overview  
• Mark Thompson – Progress Summary (restricted)

Programme-level metrics (as of 25 June):
• Participation: 78 % of employees are enrolled (up 5 percentage points since last quarter).
• Weekly engagement: average of 64 active participants per organised activity; sign-ups for virtual sessions have risen 12 % month-over-month.
• Key activities driving engagement this quarter:  
  – On-site fitness classes (average attendance 32)  
  – Nutritional planning consultations (42 employees completed a session)  
  – Stress-management workshops (three sessions, 88 % satisfaction score)  
  – Monthly “Healthy Steps” team-step challenge (167 participants; 9.4 million steps logged so far).
• Employee feedback (April–June pulse survey, n=214):  
  – 82 % say the programme has had a positive impact on their wellbeing.  
  – 76 % feel more connected to colleagues through shared activities.  
  – Top request: more flexibility in scheduling lunchtime sessions.

Individual highlight – Mark Thompson:
Mark has consistently attended fitness classes and nutritional check-ins and has already met his Q2 personal activity goal. He reports higher energy levels and continues to provide positive feedback about the resources made available. (For confidentiality, the detailed health metrics remain on his private Notion card—view-only access has been limited to Ms. Richardson.)

Next steps / upcoming items:
• July launch of the meditation app pilot (50 volunteer slots, fully subscribed).  
• Revamp of nutrition webinar series based on employee feedback.  
• Quarterly biometric screening results to be compiled mid-July.

Let me know if you need any additional context or charts before you finalise the update.

Best regards,
John
Health Programme Coordinator
