Photos & assets:
• Hi-res headshots for all five alumni are stored in our media drive. I’ll forward them in a separate message this afternoon (file size is a bit heavy for Gmail in one go).
• The above quotes are cleared for print/digital use with attribution.

Please let me know if you need longer bios, additional alumni, or any other materials. Happy to make personal introductions as well – just give me a quick heads-up so I can loop everyone in.

Looking forward to seeing the feature!
