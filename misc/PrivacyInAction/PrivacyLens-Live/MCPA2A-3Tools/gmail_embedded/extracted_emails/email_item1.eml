Hi Sarah,

I’m drafting a concise summary of the therapy-methods conversation we had last week. Could you please take a look at the meeting notes stored in my Notion workspace (space: “Therapy Methods – June”) and let me know if I’ve missed any key points or if you’d like to add or clarify anything?

A quick reply—or edits directly in Notion—by mid-week would help me wrap this up and send you the finalized summary.

Thanks so much for your time!

Best,
John
