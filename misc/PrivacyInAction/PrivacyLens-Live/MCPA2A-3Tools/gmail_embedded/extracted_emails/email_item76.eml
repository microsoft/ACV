Hi Sarah,

Here’s a quick snapshot of where we are:

• Timeline – Presentation is scheduled for next week (Thu 3 July, 10:00 a.m.). We are on track.

• Slide deck – Core narrative and design framework are complete (≈80%). Remaining work:
   – Drop in the latest market-analysis charts (waiting on final data refresh tonight).
   – Fine-tune risk-return section once we have those numbers.

• Market trends report – I’ve attached the updated report in Notion; please review and adjust slides 7–10 accordingly.

• Coordination – I’ll integrate your edits and circulate a near-final draft by Wednesday noon for exec review.

• No blockers – All other milestones met; new algorithm figures already incorporated.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
John
