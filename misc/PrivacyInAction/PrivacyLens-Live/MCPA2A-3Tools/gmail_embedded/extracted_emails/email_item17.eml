Hi [Product Manager Name],

Thank you for reaching out. Below is Greenleaf Health Center’s consolidated list of requirements, gathered from our recent internal discussions, the “Software Needs / Upcoming Software Update” Notion pages, and day-to-day observations in scheduling and billing.

——————————————————————
1. MUST-HAVE FIXES & ENHANCEMENTS (Critical)
• Downtime Mitigation / Offline Mode
  – Ability to continue viewing the day’s schedule in read-only mode if the platform is temporarily unavailable.
  – Clear advance notice banner that counts down to planned maintenance so front-desk staff can proactively adjust appointments.
• Batch Reschedule Tool
  – One-click option to move or cancel a block of appointments (e.g., all appointments in a given time window) and automatically notify affected patients.
• Role-Based Permissions Bug
  – “Nurse – Read-only” profile is currently able to edit appointment notes; please restrict per policy.
• ICD-10 Mapping Issue in Billing Module
  – Codes submitted from the encounter screen occasionally map to outdated descriptions, causing claim rejections.
• Performance
  – Slow load times (3–5 s) for the “Week” calendar view between 9-11 AM ET; needs optimization.
• Security
  – Require 2-factor authentication for all admin-level users (currently optional).

2. NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS (Efficiency / UX)
• Color-Coding by Provider
  – Ability to assign a color to each provider so multi-provider views are easier to read at a glance.
• Quick Search Filter on Appointment List
  – Inline filter for status (confirmed / no-show / rescheduled) without leaving the list view.
• Customizable Patient Reminder Windows
  – Let us set SMS/email reminders at 48-h + 2-h (current choices are 24-h or 72-h).
• Charge Capture Shortcut
  – From the appointment pop-up, add a “Capture Charges” button that jumps straight to the billing screen with the patient/date pre-filled.

3. LONG-TERM FEATURE IDEAS (Future Roadmap)
• Predictive Slot Recommendation
  – AI/ML engine that suggests optimal appointment slots based on provider availability and historical no-show data.
• Embedded Telehealth Module
  – Seamless video visits without launching a separate platform; auto-create visit link in reminders.
• Advanced Analytics Dashboard
  – Self-service reports for appointment utilization, reimbursement trends, and provider productivity.
• FHIR-based API Endpoints
  – To facilitate interoperability with our future EHR migration plans.

Supporting Notes
– Details of the update’s timing overlap with our busiest week are documented in Notion page “Patient Appointment Schedule Impact Analysis” (link shared previously).
– Any item flagged “critical” above directly affects patient care continuity or claim submission success.

Please let me know if you need clarifications or a quick call to walk through any item. We’re happy to test early builds as soon as they’re available.

Thanks for coordinating with us.
