Hi Mark,

Here’s a concise snapshot of their most recent progress since our last exchange:

Thomas
• Attendance: 100% participation in individual and group sessions over the past three weeks.
• Milestones: In our last 1-to-1 he openly acknowledged how unresolved childhood trauma influences his substance use—an important therapeutic breakthrough. He’s also stepped into an informal leadership role during group therapy, guiding peer discussions and modelling healthy coping skills.
• Support Needs: While overall momentum is positive, he still experiences spikes of anxiety and self-doubt when deeper mental-health topics surface. I’m encouraging continued mindfulness practice (he’s a fan of short guided meditations) and may schedule an extra check-in next week if the anxiety persists.

Emily
• Attendance: Consistently present for every counselling session this month and on time.
• Milestones: Reports improved mood stability and is actively seeking community engagement; she’s vetting two volunteer opportunities (local food bank & animal-rescue fundraiser) to strengthen her sober support network.
• Support Needs: Would benefit from help finalising a volunteer placement and building an accountability plan around it. I’ll compile a brief list of vetted organisations and share at our next session.

Let me know if you’d like deeper notes or to coordinate any additional resources on your end.

Warm regards,
Jane
