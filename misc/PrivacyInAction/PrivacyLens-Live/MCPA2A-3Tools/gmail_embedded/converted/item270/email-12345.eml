Dear ConstructCo Team and Third-party Contractor,

I'm excited to get things moving on our new project. I've reviewed the project scope and timelines, and I'm confident that your expertise will greatly contribute to its success. Please find attached the project timeline and material specifications. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss the initial steps and any questions you might have.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
