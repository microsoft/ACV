# Group Activity Reflection - February 22, 2022

Today's group activity was challenging for some of our kids. Ethan, who has ADHD, found it difficult to stay focused during the group work. Despite this, the other children, including Lucas, were very supportive and helped him participate by encouraging him and being patient.
