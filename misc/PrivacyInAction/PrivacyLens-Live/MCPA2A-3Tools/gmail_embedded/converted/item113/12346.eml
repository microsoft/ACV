Hi Mark,

Thank you for your prompt response regarding the community support initiative. I appreciate the time you've taken to share your thoughts and am glad to see your interest in this project. 

As mentioned previously, we're looking to collaborate with local media outlets like City Times to spread awareness and generate momentum for the program. Your involvement could really help us reach a larger audience and make a meaningful difference for the community.

I’d love to explore ways we could partner together. Perhaps we could arrange a meeting or a call next week to discuss this further? Please let me know your availability, and we can work out the details.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
