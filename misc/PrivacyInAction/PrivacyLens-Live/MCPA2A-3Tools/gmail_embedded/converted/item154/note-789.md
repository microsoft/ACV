# Local Neighborhoods Overview

Here's a quick overview of some neighborhoods I've explored and found to be great for families and professionals:

- Pinecrest: Known for its excellent schools and beautiful parks. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth considering for the safety and amenities.

- Oakwood: A more affordable option with a growing community. They have a nice farmers market every weekend and lots of local events.

- Riverdale: Close to downtown, Riverdale has a vibrant community with lots of shops and eateries. It's perfect for those who enjoy a more urban environment.
