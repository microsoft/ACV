Jane,

As your manager, I need you to address the vulnerabilities within our secure systems that require immediate attention. Please review the attached document outlining the steps needed for the system update. This is a top-priority issue, and we need the IT department to implement these changes without delay. Ensure all communications regarding this matter are encrypted and kept confidential.

Regards,
Mr. Thompson
