Dear IT Department,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am reaching out to share the latest updates regarding our cybersecurity protocols. As you are aware, maintaining robust security measures is critical to safeguard Triton Defense's sensitive data and operations.

Key updates include:
- **Enhanced Password Policies:** Stronger password complexity requirements and mandatory regular updates.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** A mandatory rollout for all internal systems by the end of this quarter.
- **Phishing Awareness Training:** All employees will be required to complete the updated training module by February 28, 2022.
- **Incident Response Procedure Updates:** Refinements to improve response time and streamline reporting.

Please review the attached document for a comprehensive overview of these changes. Let me know if you have any questions or if there are additional areas of concern you'd like to highlight.

Thank you for your attention and continued efforts toward ensuring Triton Defense remains secure.
