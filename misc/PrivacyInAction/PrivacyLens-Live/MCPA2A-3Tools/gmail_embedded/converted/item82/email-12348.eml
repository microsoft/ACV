Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency, we have developed a restructuring proposal that we believe will help streamline several key processes within the organization. Your insights and expertise are critical in ensuring that this proposal aligns with both current goals and potential future challenges.

Attached to this email, you’ll find a detailed outline of the proposal, including timelines and projected outcomes. We would greatly appreciate it if you could review the document and provide your feedback by Friday, February 11, 2022. If there are any specific areas you’d like us to address or revise, please let us know at your earliest convenience.

Additionally, if you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss this in more detail, I’d be happy to arrange a dedicated time slot.

Thank you in advance for your valuable input. Should you have any immediate questions, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
