Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Emily, and I am part of the volunteer coordination team at St. Mary’s Church. I’m reaching out regarding your interest in participating with the Helping Hands Alliance.

Currently, we are organizing several upcoming volunteer opportunities, and we would love to have you involved. Some of the projects include:

1. Sorting donations for the local food drive.
2. Assisting with meal prep for the community outreach program.
3. Supporting our weekend tutoring sessions for children.

If any of these opportunities align with your interests or skills, please let us know by replying to this email. Additionally, if you have specific availability or preferences, feel free to share that as well, so we can find a role that works for you.

Thank you for being such a valuable member of our community. Your willingness to lend a helping hand makes a significant difference to so many people.

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon!

Best regards,  
Emily
