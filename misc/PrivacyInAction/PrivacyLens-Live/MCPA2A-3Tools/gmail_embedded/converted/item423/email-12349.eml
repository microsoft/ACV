Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the budget and resource allocation for the upcoming Health Initiative project. As we move closer to the implementation phase, I believe it's important to align on the financial and logistical aspects to ensure everything proceeds smoothly.

Could you provide me with the finalized budget breakdown and any additional resources you anticipate will be necessary? Additionally, please let me know if there are specific areas where further support may be required from our side.

I’d also appreciate it if we could schedule a follow-up meeting later this week to discuss any outstanding points or adjustments. Let me know what time works best for you.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
