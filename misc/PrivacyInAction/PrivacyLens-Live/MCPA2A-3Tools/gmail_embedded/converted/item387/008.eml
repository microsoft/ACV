Dear Charlotte,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you about some updates to your travel itinerary as part of your upcoming adventure with Wanderlust Adventures. Please see the details of the changes below:

1. **Departure Date and Time Change**:
   Your flight from New York to Paris has been rescheduled from February 12, 2022, at 6:00 PM to February 12, 2022, at 8:30 PM. This is due to updated airline schedules.

2. **Hotel Accommodation**:
   We have updated your check-in time at Hotel Lumière in Paris to reflect the new flight arrival time. Your check-in will now be at 11:00 AM local time on February 13, 2022.

3. **Additional Day Tours**:
   As a gesture of goodwill, we’ve added a complimentary guided walking tour of Paris on February 14, 2022. It will start at 10:00 AM, and we will send you the meeting location and other details shortly.

If you have any questions about these changes or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I can be reached directly at this email address or via our customer support line at +1-800-555-9876.
