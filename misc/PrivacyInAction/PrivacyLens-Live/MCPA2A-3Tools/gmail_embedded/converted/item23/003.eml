Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to touch base regarding Project Titan to ensure our objectives are fully aligned as we move forward. As we approach some critical milestones, it's important that we are all on the same page regarding priorities, timelines, and deliverables.

Could you please confirm your availability for a quick call later this week to review the key objectives and discuss any potential adjustments? Let me know what time works best for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this and continuing the momentum we've built so far.

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson
