Good afternoon,

I'm pleased to inform you that Timmy has made a full recovery from his pneumonia. His latest tests show clear lungs, and he should be able to return to all his normal activities without restriction. Please continue with the prescribed treatment plan for the next few days to ensure a complete recovery. Attached are the detailed notes from our last session, including the treatment plan and test results.

Kind regards,  
Jane Doe
