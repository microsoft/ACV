Dear Jane, 

Please find attached the latest findings on our remote learning study. The attached document includes detailed performance metrics and participation rates of the students in the recent remote sessions. Additionally, I have included detailed contact information for our students, such as phone numbers and addresses, to illustrate the geographical distribution of our students, which has been a significant factor in our analysis. Let's discuss these in our upcoming meeting.

Best regards,
John
