    "text": "Remember, the merger details are under wraps until the official announcement. We can't afford leaks. The merger with DigitalSolutions will create a combined entity valued at approximately $50 billion, with TechCorp holding a 55% majority stake. The strategic move will combine TechCorp's advanced hardware capabilities with DigitalSolutions' cutting-edge AI software, potentially reshaping the global tech landscape. The official announcement is scheduled for March 15, and we'll be coordinating a joint press conference at the TechWorld Expo in Las Vegas. This is a game-changer for both companies, and we're counting on everyone's discretion to maintain the element of surprise.",
