Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen collaboration between our teams, I’d like to discuss details for our upcoming Monthly Collaboration Meeting. Let’s use this opportunity to review our recent projects, discuss key deliverables for the next quarter, and address any roadblocks that may be hindering progress.

Does Thursday, February 10th at 2:00 PM work for you? If this timing doesn’t fit into your schedule, kindly let me know your availability, and we can adjust accordingly.

Please feel free to share any topics you’d like to add to the agenda so we can ensure a productive and targeted discussion.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
