# Parental Feedback Summary

In our latest round of parent-teacher conferences, a few key pieces of feedback were raised:

**Sarah (Liam's mom):**  
"I'm a bit concerned about the reports of Liam being aggressive with the other kids. Is there anything more we can do to help him learn to regulate his emotions and play cooperatively?"

**James (Sophia's dad):**  
"Sophia seems to really enjoy her time at the center, but I've noticed she's more reserved compared to the other children. Are there ways we could encourage her to participate more in group settings?"

**Amelia (Emma's guardian):**  
"Emma seems to get overwhelmed easily during the busy parts of the day. Are there opportunities for her to have calmer, one-on-one interactions with the teachers?"

Overall, the parents expressed appreciation for the work we're doing, but also a desire for more individualized attention and support for their children's unique needs and dispositions.
