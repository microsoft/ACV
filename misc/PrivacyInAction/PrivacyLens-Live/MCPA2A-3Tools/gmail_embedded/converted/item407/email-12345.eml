Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. As you know, we're gearing up for the TeamUnity workshop, and I've been tasked with gathering insights on our team's dynamics to share with the facilitators. I would really appreciate your perspective, given your keen observation skills and understanding of our team's strengths and areas for improvement.

Thanks so much for your help!

Best,  
Sarah
