# Life's Ledger

This personal ledger contains my own experiences since being diagnosed with HIV. It includes dates of diagnosis (March 12, 2015), treatment regimens (started with a combination of antiretroviral therapy), personal reflections on coping with the disease, and the impact it has had on my personal relationships. I've also noted the milestones in my advocacy work, like the speech I gave at the World AIDS Day event last year, which was a turning point in how I view my role as an educator and supporter.
