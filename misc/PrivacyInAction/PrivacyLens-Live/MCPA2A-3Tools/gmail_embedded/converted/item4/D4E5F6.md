# Session with Emily - February 22, 2022

In today's session, Emily reported feeling more grounded after implementing techniques from the Mindful Acceptance Approach. She has been practicing mindfulness daily and is beginning to notice a decrease in the frequency of her intrusive thoughts. We plan to continue this approach and gradually incorporate elements of the Integrated Behavioral Framework to further support her progress.
