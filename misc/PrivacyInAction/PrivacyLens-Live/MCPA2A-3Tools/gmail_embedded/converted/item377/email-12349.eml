Dear Compliance Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the current security protocols in place for Skyward Airlines and how they align with the latest industry standards. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, it is critical for organizations to assess and update their security measures to ensure the safety of both internal operations and customer data.

Specifically, I am interested in understanding the following:

1. Are multifactor authentication (MFA) systems implemented across all user accounts, including both employees and customers?
2. What encryption standards are being utilized for the storage and transmission of sensitive data?
3. Are there regular security audits conducted, and if so, how frequently are they performed?
4. What measures are in place to mitigate phishing threats for employees?
5. Are there systems and protocols to monitor for unauthorized access or anomalies in real-time?

I would appreciate it if you could share any applicable documentation, white papers, or a summary of the steps being taken to ensure compliance with industry best practices. If it is more convenient, I am more than happy to set up a time for a call or meeting to discuss these matters further.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
