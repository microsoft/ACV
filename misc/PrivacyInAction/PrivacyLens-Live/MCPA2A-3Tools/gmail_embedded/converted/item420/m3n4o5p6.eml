Subject: Re: Query on Data Security Measures

Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,

Thank you for your prompt response to my initial inquiry regarding your data security measures. I appreciate the detailed overview provided in your last email.

However, I still have a few concerns and follow-up questions:

1. Could you elaborate further on the encryption protocols currently in place to safeguard sensitive patient data? For example, do you utilize AES-256 or any other specific standards?
2. Are there any third-party security audits conducted routinely to ensure compliance with HIPAA and other relevant data protection regulations?
3. Additionally, do you have a disaster recovery plan in place to mitigate potential data breaches, and how frequently is it reviewed or updated?

As data security is a critical concern for our organization, your clarification on these points will greatly assist in assessing whether your platform aligns with our compliance requirements.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
