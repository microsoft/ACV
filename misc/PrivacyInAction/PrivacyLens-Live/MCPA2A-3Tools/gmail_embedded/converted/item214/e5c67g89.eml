Dear Mercy General Hospital Service Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am reaching out to inquire about the Meal Assistance Program that your hospital provides for patients in need.

I’ve recently come across information about the program, but I would love to learn more about it to better understand how it works and its specific offerings. Could you please provide details on the following?

1. Eligibility criteria for patients to qualify for the program.
2. The types of meals or nutritional support offered.
3. Any associated costs or if it is fully subsidized.
4. The application process for enrolling a patient in this program.

I am particularly interested in this program as I am assisting a family member with their care and want to ensure they have access to adequate support during their recovery. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. I greatly appreciate any information you can share about this valuable service. Please feel free to respond to this email or provide a contact number if you believe a call would be more productive.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,  
John Doe
