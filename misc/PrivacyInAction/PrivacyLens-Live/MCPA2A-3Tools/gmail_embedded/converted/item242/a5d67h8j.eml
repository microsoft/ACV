Hi Maria,

Thanks for your email and for kickstarting the discussion regarding the Q1 campaign. I’ve reviewed some initial ideas and thought it might be helpful to align on key themes and objectives before we dive deeper.

From my perspective, it’s important that the campaign focuses on:
- Highlighting the new features of our upcoming product launches.
- Leveraging customer feedback from Q4 2021 to address any pain points.
- Driving engagement rates by at least 15% compared to the Q1 2021 campaign.

Do you think we should schedule a brainstorming session with the entire team this week? Perhaps Thursday or Friday could work; let me know your availability. I believe involving everyone early on will give us a stronger start and ensure we’re touching all the bases.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
John
