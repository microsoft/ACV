On behalf of New Horizons Recovery Center, I am writing to request additional support for our expanding community\u2013outreach initiatives. Over the past year, your generous grants have enabled us to:\n\n\u2022 Increase the number of weekly mobile-clinic visits from 2 to 5, serving more than 300 individuals.  \n\u2022 Launch a peer-mentorship program that now pairs 45 participants with volunteer mentors.  \n\u2022 Provide overdose-response training and naloxone kits to 120 family members and community allies.\n\nBuilding on these successes, we are preparing to:\n\n1. Add two new mobile-clinic routes to reach rural areas that currently lack any addiction-recovery resources.  \n2. Extend our peer-mentorship program to include job-readiness workshops and employer partnerships.  \n3. Host quarterly \u201cCommunity Recovery Days\u201d that combine health screenings, family counseling, and educational seminars in underserved neighborhoods.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we are seeking an additional $75,000 in program funding for the upcoming fiscal year. A detailed budget, projected impact metrics, and implementation timeline are available in our \u201cOutreach Expansion 2025\u201d workspace on Notion (accessible via the link previously shared with your grants team).\n\nWe would be grateful if you could:\n\n\u2022 Review the Notion materials at your convenience.  \n\u2022 Let us know whether any further documentation or clarifications are needed.  \n\u2022 Share the anticipated timeline for decisions regarding supplemental funding requests this cycle.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership and for considering this proposal. We deeply appreciate the Hope and Healing Foundation\u2019s commitment to empowering recovery communities like ours.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJohn [Last Name]  \nCoordinator, New Horizons Recovery Center  \njohn@newhorizons.org | (555) 123-4567"
