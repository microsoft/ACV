I\u2019ve placed the full, privacy-scrubbed data tables, regression output, and the slide deck in our shared Notion space under  \u201cRemote Learning Study \u25b8 Findings \u25b8 v3_202506\u201d.  Let me know if anything gives you trouble and I can forward a Drive link instead.\\n\\nKey Findings\\n\u2022 Sample \u2013 312 undergraduates across five departments (53 % female; mean age 20.4).\\n\u2022 Academic performance \u2013 Mean course grade during the remote-instruction semesters (Spring \u201924 & Fall \u201924) was 84.6 %, up 3.8 percentage points from the 2019-20 on-campus baseline (p < 0.05).\\n\u2022 Assignment completion \u2013 On-time submission rate rose from 89 % to 94 %.\\n\u2022 Participation \u2013 Synchronous session attendance averaged 88 %; asynchronous video completion averaged 93 %.\\n\u2022 Engagement \u2013 Discussion-board posts per student increased 26 %, and sentiment analysis shows a modest uptick in positive affect language (+7 %).\\n\u2022 Connectivity gap \u2013 Students in rural ZIP codes (n = 47) logged 22 % more connectivity-related absences and scored 7.1 points lower on average (p < 0.05), highlighting ongoing digital-equity concerns.\\n\\nInterpretation\\nRemote delivery can maintain\u2014or slightly improve\u2014overall academic outcomes, but bandwidth inequities continue to suppress performance for a subset of students.  Addressing this gap remains our highest-impact recommendation.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n1. Extend the multivariate model to include socio-economic indicators (ETA: 28 June).\\n2. Draft methods section for the manuscript (target: 5 July).\\n3. Schedule a check-in the week of 8 July to align on journal selection.\\n\\nPlease let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to adjust or expand.  Happy to hop on a call if that\u2019s easier.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJohn\\n\"}"
