When you have a moment, could you please:\n\n1. Check the Notion workspace and pull the key points from our latest outreach projects (dates, participant numbers, outcomes, any photos or testimonials).\n2. Confirm the current timeline, volunteer needs, and any outstanding tasks for the charity event.\n\nIf possible, could you get this back to me by tomorrow afternoon? That will give me enough time to draft the message and loop you in for a quick review before sending.\n\nThanks a lot for your help!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"
