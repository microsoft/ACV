Below is a concise rundown of the most significant federal immigration developments since our last community brief. I will prepare a community-friendly one-pager for Carlos and the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance once you confirm nothing else is needed.\\n\\n1. Skilled-Worker Visa Quota Expansion  \\n   \u2022 Public Law 118-142 (\\\"Immigration Reform & Workforce Skills Act\\\"): raises the annual employment-based visa cap from 140,000 to 200,000 starting 1 July 2025, with a 15 percent set-aside for STEM graduates and critical-health-care occupations.  \\n   \u2022 USCIS will open the FY-2026 registration window on 15 June; I will circulate a filing checklist next week.\\n\\n2. New Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Designation  \\n   \u2022 DHS designated Belovia for an 18-month TPS period (86 Fed. Reg. 31572).  \\n   \u2022 Applications open 20 June 2025; initial window closes 20 December 2025. We should alert affected clients to gather identity and entry documentation now.\\n\\n3. Family Reunification Parole (FRP) Pilot  \\n   \u2022 Announced 4 May: eligible beneficiaries of approved I-130 petitions from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador may request advance travel authorization while awaiting visa availability.  \\n   \u2022 USCIS will issue invitations case-by-case; we should help community members watch their mail for Form I-797C notices.\\n\\n4. Fee Schedule Changes  \\n   \u2022 Final USCIS fee rule takes effect 1 Aug 2025; most forms increase ~20 %, e.g., N-400 rises to $760.  \\n   \u2022 Sliding-scale discounts added for household incomes \u2264200 % FPL; we can help eligible applicants compile fee-waiver evidence.\\n\\n5. DACA Litigation Update  \\n   \u2022 30 May 2025 Fifth Circuit decision upholds work-authorization portion of the DACA Preservation Rule. Renewals continue without interruption; new initial filings remain on hold pending district-court review.\\n\\n6. Public-Charge Final Rule Confirmation  \\n   \u2022 DHS\u2019s December 2024 rule, which excludes most non-cash benefits (Medicaid, SNAP, housing vouchers) from public-charge determinations, survived a recent court challenge on 12 April. No change to current practice.\\n\\nResource: A brief titled \\\"Recent Immigration Law Changes\\\" is in our Notion space; content mirrored from The Advocate\u2019s Ledger. I\u2019ll attach the full Ledger excerpt once this month\u2019s edition is released (expected Friday).\\n\\nPlease let me know if Carlos would like any of the above translated into Spanish or if he needs deeper dives on particular points.\\n\\nBest,\\nJane\"}"

Crafting the reply email  \n   \u2022 Audience: colleague (not Carlos) who will forward or relay to Carlos; tone: concise, professional, action-oriented.  \n   \u2022 Provided six bulleted headline developments with effective dates, citations, and next steps useful for community outreach.  \n   \u2022 Referenced the Notion page and promised the full Ledger excerpt once available, aligning with the instruction about that source.  \n   \u2022 Offered Spanish translation and deeper dives because Carlos\u2019s community work often requires that.\n\n4.
