Dear HR Team at Tech Innovations,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of the transition process for John Smith, I’m forwarding you the Q4 performance review we conducted while he was with our organization. Please let me know if you need any additional documentation or details regarding his work here.

John had demonstrated consistent performance during the fourth quarter, and he successfully contributed to several key projects, including the rollout of our new digital onboarding system. He maintained a high level of professionalism and exhibited strong team collaboration skills.

You may reach out to me directly if you have further questions or require clarification on any specifics in the review.

Best regards,
