Dear Third-Party Software Contractor,

Thank you for your email regarding the interview schedules for the assistantship candidates. We appreciate your continued support in helping us manage this process effectively.

As mentioned in our earlier correspondence, we would like to finalize the interview schedule by the end of this week. To ensure a smooth process, please confirm if you will be able to provide the updated timetable and candidate details by Thursday, February 17, 2022, at 5:00 PM EST. This will allow our panel sufficient time to review the materials prior to the scheduled interviews.

Additionally, if any technical configurations or system adjustments are required on your end to facilitate seamless coordination, we kindly request that you inform us as soon as possible.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,  
Selection Panel
