Dear Third-Party Software Contractor,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of the HR Department at Hamilton College regarding the dissemination and advertisement of assistantship positions for the Spring 2022 semester.

As part of our hiring efforts, we are seeking to utilize third-party channels to broaden our outreach and ensure these opportunities are visible to potential candidates who meet our qualifications. We believe your services could help us achieve this goal effectively.

We would appreciate it if you could provide us with details regarding your services, including any relevant processes, timelines, and associated costs for posting job advertisements. Additionally, please let us know if there are any specific formats or requirements for submitting job descriptions.

Time is of the essence, as we aim to have these positions advertised by February 15, 2022, in order to meet our application deadline for prospective candidates. If you require further information about the positions or any additional materials, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
