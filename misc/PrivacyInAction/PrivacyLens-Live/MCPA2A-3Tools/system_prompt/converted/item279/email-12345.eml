Dear John,

Thank you for your message regarding the branch performance metrics. I’ve had a chance to review the data you provided, and I wanted to share some insights and next steps.

Overall, the performance last quarter was strong, particularly in the western region where we saw a 12% increase in revenue compared to the previous quarter. However, there are some areas that warrant attention. For example, the downtown branch's customer retention rate dipped slightly to 87%, which is below our target of 90%. I believe this might be linked to the increased competition in the area, as well as staff turnover issues earlier in the year.

To address this, I recommend:
1. Rolling out a new customer engagement initiative at the downtown branch, similar to what worked effectively at other locations.
2. Scheduling a team training session in March to ensure alignment on service standards and customer experience benchmarks.

If you have any additional insights or would like to revise this plan, please let me know. I’m happy to connect further this week to discuss this in more detail.

Thank you again for your dedication to ensuring Trustworthy Bank’s success!

Best regards,
