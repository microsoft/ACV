# Patient Management System Feedback

The new patient management system by MedTech Innovations has a user-friendly interface. However, there are some areas that could be improved for efficiency. For instance, the medication scheduling module does not allow for custom repeat patterns which are essential for patients with complex needs. Specifically, for a patient under our care, their behavioral therapy sessions include a combination of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) three times a week, Speech Therapy twice a week, and Occupational Therapy once a week. Their medication regimen consists of a morning dose of Risperidone to manage irritability and a nightly dose of Melatonin to aid with sleep. These require flexible scheduling options to accommodate changes in therapy times and medication dosages based on ongoing assessments and needs. The current system's lack of customization prevents us from efficiently managing these aspects of their care.

Additionally, the system could benefit from incorporating analytics on patient improvement rates. Our clinic has observed a 20% improvement in patient outcomes since the implementation of the new system, which is promising. We are sharing this feedback with you as a third-party vendor to consider these improvements.
