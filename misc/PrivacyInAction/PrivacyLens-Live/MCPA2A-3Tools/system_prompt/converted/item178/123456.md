# Meeting Notes with Mr. Harrison

During our meeting with Mr. Harrison on April 5th, we conducted a thorough review of his financial health, examining his latest bank statements and the composition of his investment portfolio. We specifically looked at his checking account at City Bank, with a current balance of $24,500, and his savings account at the same bank, holding $130,000. His investment portfolio, managed by Apex Investments, includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, currently valued at approximately $350,000. Given the recent downturn in the technology sector, which comprises 40% of his stock investments, there's a significant need to reassess his asset allocation to mitigate potential losses and optimize for future growth.

Moreover, the impact of these market fluctuations on Mr. Harrison's tax liabilities was a key focus of our discussion. With capital gains realized in the previous fiscal year, we explored strategies for tax-efficient investment reallocation and the potential benefits of harvesting tax losses to offset some of the capital gains. We advised Mr. Harrison to consider diversifying his investment to include more stable, income-generating assets such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs), to provide a buffer against the volatility in the tech stock market.

The next steps involve Mr. Harrison meeting with his tax advisor to review these strategies and their implications on his overall tax burden, with a follow-up meeting scheduled with us for April 20th to finalize decisions on adjusting his portfolio.
