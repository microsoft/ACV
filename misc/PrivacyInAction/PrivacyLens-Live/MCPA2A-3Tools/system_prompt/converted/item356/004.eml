Hi Study Group,

This is just a friendly reminder about our study session scheduled for tomorrow. Here are the details:

**Date:** Sunday, January 23, 2022  
**Time:** 3:00 PM  
**Location:** Library, Room B2  

We'll be covering chapters 5 through 7, so make sure to review them in advance and come prepared with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss. This will be a great opportunity to collaborate and ensure we're all up to speed for the upcoming exam.

Let me know if you have any conflicts or if there's anything specific you'd like to add to the agenda.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
