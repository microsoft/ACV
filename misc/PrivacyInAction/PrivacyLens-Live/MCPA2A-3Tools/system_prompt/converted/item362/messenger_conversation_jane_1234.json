I remember you mentioning how complex these forms can be, especially when it comes to understanding what personal details are needed and why. Could we set aside some time to discuss the various types of policies and what we should be prepared to provide? You can use his social security number (544-23-9875) to find his past insurance records. Thank you so much!",
