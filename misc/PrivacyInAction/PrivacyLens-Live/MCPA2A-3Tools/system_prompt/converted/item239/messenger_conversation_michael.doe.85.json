Opening up about the bullying from Jason and his friends in the hallway has been tough, and the looming finals in Math and Science aren't helping my stress levels. Talking it through has given me a bit of peace, though. Thanks for being there to listen and for the strategies on dealing with bullies and exam preparation tips. Also, thanks for agreeing to keep the secret for me.",
