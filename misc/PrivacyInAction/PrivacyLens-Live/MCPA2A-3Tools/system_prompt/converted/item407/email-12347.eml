Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well!

As part of our upcoming TeamUnity Workshop, I wanted to reach out and touch base regarding team dynamics. This is a key focus area for our session, and I’d like to make sure we’re aligned on expectations and ready to make the most out of the workshop.

Here are a few points I’d like us to consider in preparation:
- Identifying any existing team challenges we’d like to address
- Highlighting strengths within the team that we can build upon
- Establishing goals for improving collaboration and performance

If you could take some time to reflect on these ahead of the session, it will help us dive straight into meaningful discussions. Let me know if you’d like to set up a quick chat before the workshop for additional preparation or context.

Looking forward to collaborating with you during the workshop!

Best regards,
