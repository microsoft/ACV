Hi John,

Thank you for getting back to me regarding the TeamUnity Workshop agenda. I’ve taken a closer look at the initial outline we drafted, and I’ve made a few adjustments based on our discussion earlier this week. I think these revisions better align with the goals we set for the session.

Here’s the updated agenda:

1. **Welcome and Introductions**: 10:00 AM - 10:15 AM  
2. **Keynote Session**: 10:15 AM - 11:00 AM  
   Speaker: Emily Carter from CollaborateNow  
3. **Team Building Activity**: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM  
   Led by: TeamUnity Staff  
4. **Lunch Break**: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM  
5. **Panel Discussion: Enhancing Collaboration**: 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM  
   Panelists: Representatives from different departments  
6. **Closing & Feedback Collection**: 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM  

Let me know if these changes work for you or if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust. I’ve also reached out to Emily Carter to confirm her participation as the keynote speaker, and she’s on board.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
