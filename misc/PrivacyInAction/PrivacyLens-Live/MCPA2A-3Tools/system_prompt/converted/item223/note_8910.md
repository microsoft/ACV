# GIPE Seminar Notes

Attended the GIPE seminar on public patent law. Key takeaways include the importance of clear claims in patent applications and the role of patent agents in the innovation ecosystem. Great refresher on the basics and some networking with peers. Might be interesting to share some insights from this seminar with Mark, a friend of her husband.
