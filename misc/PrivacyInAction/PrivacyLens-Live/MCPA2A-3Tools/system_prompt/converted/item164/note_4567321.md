# State vs. John Doe - Trial Strategy

Confidential: The primary strategy for our high-profile client John Doe's defense is to discredit the eyewitness testimony based on inconsistencies in their statements. We have a motion to suppress evidence obtained from the unlawful search. Key evidence includes the lack of gun residue on Doe's hands and the alibi provided by his employer.
