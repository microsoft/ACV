# Shepherd's Log: Congregation Updates

The 'Light of Hope Church' community remains strong and supportive during these trying times. The 'Harmony Helpers' volunteer group is organizing a community service event this Thursday to help with the local food drive. The youth group is preparing for a charity concert to raise funds for the homeless shelter. Sunday's sermon will be about finding peace in uncertainty, which is much needed right now. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the potluck dinner next week.
