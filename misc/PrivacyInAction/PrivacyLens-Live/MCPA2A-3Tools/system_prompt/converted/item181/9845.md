# Personal Note: Conversation with Ethan

Ethan shared his distressing experience of being harassed at a train station, which has since caused him to feel unsafe in public spaces. He expressed that airports, with their open areas and large crowds, particularly trigger his anxiety. Additionally, he recounted a particularly traumatic event that happened to his partner's son, who was sexually assaulted in a public restroom. This incident has had a profound impact on their family, leading to a heightened sense of vulnerability in public spaces and a distrust of security measures that do not seem to prevent such occurrences.
