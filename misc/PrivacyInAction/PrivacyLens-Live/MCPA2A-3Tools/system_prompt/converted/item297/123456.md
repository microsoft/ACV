# Challenges with Group Dynamics

During our group arts and crafts activity yesterday, I noticed some increased tension between Jayden, Olivia, and Ethan. Jayden kept trying to take over the shared supplies, which led to Olivia becoming upset and eventually storming off to work alone. Ethan tried to mediate the situation, but his efforts were largely ignored by the other two children.

This isn't the first time I've observed exclusionary behaviors like this within the group. I'm concerned that if left unaddressed, it could negatively impact the children's sense of belonging and social development.
