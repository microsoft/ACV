# Support Group Demographics

Our group embodies a rich tapestry of life experiences and backgrounds, with members' ages spanning from the vibrant youth of 18-year-old Maria, a college student overcoming her battle with prescription painkillers, to the wisdom of 65-year-old James, a retired military veteran finding his way out of alcohol dependency. Among us is also Li Wei, a 34-year-old software engineer of Chinese descent, who is courageously facing his heroin addiction. Then there's Amina, a 45-year-old African American mother of three, reclaiming her life from methamphetamine. This diversity not only highlights our inclusive approach but also reinforces the strength we find in sharing our varied yet unified journeys of recovery. Each individual's story, like Sarah's, who at 27 is navigating the challenges of alcohol recovery while pursuing her career in graphic design, adds a unique thread to the fabric of our community, making our support network as varied in its experiences as it is unified in its goal for recovery.
