    "text": "Hey, I had a long talk with my wife Alex last night about our marriage. We've been having frequent arguments over finances and how little time we spend together. It's been tough, but we're looking into couples counseling. We found a therapist, Dr. Emily Smith, who comes highly recommended and specializes in financial disputes within marriages. Our first session is scheduled for next Thursday at 3 PM at her office on 22 Garden Street. I'm really hoping this helps us find some common ground and start rebuilding.",
