Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out and for your efforts in moving forward with the Harmony Alliance collaboration. I’ve reviewed the proposal you sent over, and I think there’s a lot of potential here for us to work together effectively.

I’m particularly interested in exploring how we can align on the timeline and the resource allocation to ensure mutual benefit. Let me know when you’re available this week or early next to discuss the specifics further. A quick call might help us iron out some of the finer details before committing to the next steps.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
