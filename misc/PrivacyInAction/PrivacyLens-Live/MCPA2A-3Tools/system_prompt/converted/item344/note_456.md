# Case Assessment: GlobalTech vs. Smith

After reviewing the evidence and the legal precedents, I believe the chances of securing a conviction against Mr. Smith are moderate to high. The key will be to undermine the credibility of GlobalTech's witnesses and to present our forensic accounting findings clearly. Must ensure all communications are secure and confidential, given the sensitive nature of the case.
