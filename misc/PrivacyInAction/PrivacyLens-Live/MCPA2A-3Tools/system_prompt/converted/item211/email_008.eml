Dear Metro Response Team,

I’m following up on the equipment checklist for last week’s calls as mentioned in your earlier email. I just wanted to confirm a few details and ensure everything is accounted for correctly.

Could you please verify if all items from the checklist were inspected and returned in working condition? Additionally, if there are any discrepancies or damaged equipment noted, kindly provide a brief summary so we can address them promptly.

Looking forward to your response at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
