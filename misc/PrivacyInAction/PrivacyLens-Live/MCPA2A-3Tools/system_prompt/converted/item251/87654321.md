# Understanding Compound Interest

Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It can be thought of as 'interest on interest,' and it will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount.
