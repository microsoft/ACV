Hello Jane,

We are reaching out to discuss the necessary accommodations for our upcoming exams. Could you please provide us with the latest updates on any accommodations that need to be made for students, especially those with special requirements? Your input is invaluable in helping us create a conducive environment for all our students.

Thank you for your assistance,
