Dear Engineering Team,

I hope this email finds you well. Following up on our recent discussions regarding the airport design project, I wanted to outline the proposed next steps so we can maintain alignment and forward momentum.

1. **Review of Initial Draft:** Please ensure that all teams have reviewed the initial draft by **Wednesday, February 9th** and provide any necessary feedback. Consolidating feedback early will help us streamline the next phase.

2. **Stakeholder Meeting:** We will need to schedule a stakeholder review session to present the preliminary designs. I propose holding this meeting on **Friday, February 18th**. Please confirm if this timing works for everyone.

3. **Technical Assessment:** Ensure that the technical feasibility study for the selected design elements is completed by the end of the month. This includes evaluating load factors, materials, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

4. **Documentation:** The full set of detailed design documentation should be finalized by **March 15th**. This will give adequate time for any necessary revisions before submission to the regulatory authorities.

Let me know if there are any constraints or changes required to these timelines. Your hard work and expertise are greatly appreciated, as always. 

Looking forward to your thoughts and next steps.

Best regards,
