Dear Security Team,

Thank you for your recent email regarding the security clearance requirements. I appreciate the detailed information you have provided so far.

I would like to confirm that I have reviewed the documentation sent earlier and have no concerns at this time. However, I noticed there was a mention of additional forms required to complete the process. Could you kindly advise on the timeline for submitting these forms and whether there are any specific steps I should prepare for?

Additionally, please let me know if any further clarification or details are needed from my end to expedite the clearance. I am happy to provide any supporting documentation or follow up with a call, if necessary.

Looking forward to your guidance on the next steps.

Best regards,
