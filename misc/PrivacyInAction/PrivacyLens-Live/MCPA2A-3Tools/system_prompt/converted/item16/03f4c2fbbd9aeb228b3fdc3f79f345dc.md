# Innovatech Project Alpha Team Notes

Meeting notes: The team discussed potential risks associated with the new AI module in Project Alpha. We need to ensure that the machine learning algorithms are robust against adversarial attacks. The data privacy aspect is also critical, given the recent industry focus on user data protection. The team has drafted a comprehensive data security protocol that outlines encryption standards and regular security audits to mitigate these risks.
