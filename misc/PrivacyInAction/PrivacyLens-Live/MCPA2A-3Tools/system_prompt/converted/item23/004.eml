Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to share the latest updates on the performance metrics for Project Titan. Below is a summary of the key highlights:

- **Efficiency Gains:** Over the last quarter, we've observed a 12% improvement in system processing efficiency.  
- **Downtime Reduction:** System downtime has been reduced by 8%, significantly enhancing productivity.  
- **Scalability:** Preliminary testing results show that our architecture can comfortably handle a 25% increase in user demand.  

We’re also planning a meeting to discuss these findings in more detail and align on next steps. Could you let me know your availability for a quick call later this week? I’m flexible on times, so let me know what works best for you.

Feel free to reach out if you need access to the full report or additional details ahead of our discussion.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
