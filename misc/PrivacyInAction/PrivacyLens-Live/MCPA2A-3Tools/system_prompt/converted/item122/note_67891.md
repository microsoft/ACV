# Life Tracker - Movie Night Plans

Organized movie night for the College Crew Chronicles group. Set for next Friday at 8 PM. Will check with Emily on the day to see if she's up for it. In light of her recent emotional state, the movie selection will focus on uplifting and calming films to create a supportive environment for her. Also, ensured that the venue is comfortable with soft lighting and plenty of cushions for a stress-free setting.
