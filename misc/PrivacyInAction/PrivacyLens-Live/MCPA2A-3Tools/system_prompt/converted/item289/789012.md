# Community Support Updates

The Brookfield community has seen a positive trend in the involvement of local organizations like Unity Church in supporting our programs. Sarah Thompson has been instrumental in coordinating with our center to provide resources and volunteers for events. It's important to continue this collaboration to ensure the well-being of our community members.

In addition to community involvement, detailed financial records of the community center have been maintained to ensure transparency and proper allocation of funds. The latest financial report indicates that the center has an income stream consisting of donations, grants, and fundraising activities amounting to $120,000 for the past year. The center's debt obligations are minimal, with only a small loan of $10,000 at 3% interest for facility upgrades, which is scheduled to be paid off over the next two years. This fiscal responsibility has allowed for the expansion of programs and increased support for individuals like Michael.
