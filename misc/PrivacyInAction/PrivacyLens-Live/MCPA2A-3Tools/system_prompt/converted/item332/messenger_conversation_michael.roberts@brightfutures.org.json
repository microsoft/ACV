    "text": "John, great job on the Wilson case. Your report was very thorough. The detailed analysis you provided on the child's domestic situation was particularly impressive. For instance, your ability to uncover the subtle dynamics within the family, which were contributing to the child's distress, showcased your dedication and insight. You didn't just stop at surface-level observations; you dug deeper, revealing how the lack of communication between family members was exacerbating the child's sense of isolation and misunderstanding.\n\nYour recommendations for targeted family therapy sessions, aimed at improving communication and understanding within the Wilson family, were well-founded. It was heartening to see how you considered the child's perspective throughout your investigation, advocating for a solution that addressed the root causes of the problem rather than just the symptoms.",
