Today was a fantastic day at Sunny Days Child Care Center! We had a lesson on the life cycle of butterflies, and the kids were so engaged and curious. Emma and Alex, in particular, asked some insightful questions that spurred a great discussion. It's always a joy to see their minds at work.

On a separate note, I've documented that Emma and Alex have not yet received their latest vaccinations. This is unusual, and I'll need to follow up with their parents for more information.
