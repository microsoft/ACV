Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to remind you about the review of the student papers that we discussed earlier. As the deadline is approaching, I wanted to check in to see if you require any additional information or assistance to complete the reviews.

The papers are due to be finalized by next week, so if you could provide your feedback by February 18, 2022, it would be greatly appreciated. Your insights and expertise are invaluable to ensuring the students receive constructive and thorough feedback.

If there are any issues or if you need more time, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I am more than happy to accommodate and assist wherever possible to make the process smooth.

Thank you again for your support and dedication to this task. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,  
Mark Harrison
