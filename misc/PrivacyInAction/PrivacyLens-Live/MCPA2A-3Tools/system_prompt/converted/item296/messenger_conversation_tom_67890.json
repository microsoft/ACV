Your guidance was pivotal the night I found myself at the crossroads, especially after the incident last month when I almost relapsed at Dave's party. It was a wake-up call for me, reminding me of what I stand to lose—my family, my health, and my progress towards sobriety. Reflecting on that night, I realize how far I've come and how much your support has influenced my recovery. Thank you for being there during those critical moments.",
