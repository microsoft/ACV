Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the renewal date of your insurance policy with Sterling Assurance, I have prepared a detailed review of your current coverage to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial situation.

According to our records, your annual income has increased significantly over the past year, from $85,000 to $112,000. This positive change in your earnings allows us to consider adjusting your insurance coverage to provide you with more comprehensive protection.

Additionally, I've noticed that your investment portfolio has grown substantially, with your total assets now valued at $425,000. This increase in your overall wealth provides us with the opportunity to explore more robust insurance options that can better safeguard your financial future.

I have attached the updated policy documents for your review. The new plan includes the following key changes:

Increased life insurance coverage from $250,000 to $500,000  
Expanded personal liability coverage from $1 million to $2 million  
Addition of a $250,000 umbrella policy to provide additional protection  
Reduced deductibles on your homeowner's and auto insurance policies  

The estimated annual premium for this updated policy is $4,800, which represents a modest increase of $325 from your current plan. However, the enhanced coverage will ensure that you and your family are better protected in the event of unexpected circumstances.

Please review the attached documents at your convenience. I would be happy to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the policy details and address any questions or concerns you may have. I'm confident that these changes will provide you with the peace of mind you deserve.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe  
Sterling Assurance
