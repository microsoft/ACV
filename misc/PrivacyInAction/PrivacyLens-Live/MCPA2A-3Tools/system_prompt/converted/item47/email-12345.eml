Hi John,

Thanks for bringing up the concerns regarding the office environment adjustments in your previous email. I completely understand how these factors can impact productivity and comfort levels during work hours.

Regarding your points:

1. **Temperature Control**: I'll speak with the facilities team to see if there is a way to better regulate the temperature in the office. If you have any specific times of day when the issue tends to occur, please provide that information, and I'll pass it along.

2. **Lighting**: I agree that some areas of the office could use better lighting. We can explore adding more LED panels or desk lamps for those needing extra illumination. Let me know if there are particular areas where this is more critical.

3. **Noise Levels**: For noise concerns, we may want to consider designating quiet zones or providing noise-canceling headphones to team members who need them. If you have a preference or another suggestion, please share it.

I appreciate your input on these matters, as creating the best possible working environment is a priority for all of us here at Innosoft.

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to add or if you want to set up a time to discuss this further.

Best regards,
