Dear Jane,

Please find attached the documents related to Eric's recent absences and his participation in company programs. The attached doctor's note outlines that Eric has been diagnosed with epilepsy, which has resulted in his recent absences. Additionally, you will find records of Eric's completed training certifications and his active engagement in our wellness program. These documents are confidential and should be handled with the utmost discretion.

Best regards,
Technotronix HR Department
