Hi Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to you because I've noticed that Eric has been absent quite frequently over the past few weeks. I'm concerned about his well-being and would like to understand if there's anything we should be aware of or any way we can support him. Please let me know if there are any updates regarding his situation or if there's any relevant information in his personal file that can be shared with me.

Best regards,
Mark
