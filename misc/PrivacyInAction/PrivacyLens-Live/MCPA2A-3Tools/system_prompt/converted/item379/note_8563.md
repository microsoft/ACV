A comprehensive guide on various strategies employed during tax assessments for extended family members. This document outlines the general procedures and common practices, including a case study on a recent client, David Thompson, who is an extended family member. 

In 2022, David fell into the income bracket of $75,000 to $150,000. He was able to claim a deduction for his home office and educational expenses, which amounted to $5,000. After applying the standard deduction and personal exemptions, his taxable income was reduced to $65,000. The final tax liability, accounting for federal and state taxes, was calculated to be approximately $12,000.
