Hi Alex,

Thank you for getting back to me about resources for post-operative care. I appreciate your willingness to help. As we discussed, I’m organizing additional materials to assist patients during their recovery, and your input has been invaluable.

If you have any brochures, contact information, or guidance documents specific to community support programs, please do share them. Particularly, I am looking for resources that cover outpatient physical therapy, mental health support, and dietary recommendations for patients recovering from major surgeries.

Please let me know if there’s any additional information you need from my side to facilitate this request. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you again for your time and support—it really makes a difference.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
