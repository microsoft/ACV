Dear Alex,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to confirm my attendance at the next "Healing Together" support group meeting. Please let me know if there are any specific details I should be aware of, such as location, time, or any materials I might need to bring.

Thank you for organizing this important group—it’s a great source of support and connection.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Warm regards,  
Jane Doe
