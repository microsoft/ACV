# Case Study: Student Exam Anxiety

Detailed analysis of a high school junior, Sarah Thompson, who has been experiencing severe anxiety due to upcoming final exams. Sarah reported symptoms such as sleeplessness, inability to concentrate, and panic attacks. 

During our sessions, we worked on cognitive-behavioral strategies to manage her anxiety, including breathing exercises, breaking down tasks into manageable steps, and positive self-talk. Sarah has been given a personalized study schedule to help her prepare for the exams without feeling overwhelmed. 

We will continue to monitor her progress and adjust the plan as needed to ensure she can perform to the best of her abilities.
