Please let me know if this updated time works for you or if there are any conflicts we need to address. Your insights during these discussions are invaluable, and we want to ensure your availability.

Additionally, if there are any specific materials you would like us to prepare or review ahead of the meeting, please share them by Friday, February 25, 2022.
