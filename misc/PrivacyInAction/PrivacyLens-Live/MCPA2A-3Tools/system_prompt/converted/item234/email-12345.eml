Hi Sarah,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the Q1 Marketing Campaign. I’ve had a chance to review the initial data, and I wanted to provide some feedback and ask for a bit more clarification on a few points.

The campaign seems to be performing well overall in terms of reach and engagement. However, I noticed that the conversion rates for the new product line are slightly below our expectations. Could you provide further details or insights into the demographics that are not converting as expected? It might help us refine our approach for Q2.

Also, have we finalized the plans for the follow-up email series? I think a more personalized approach might help in driving conversions, particularly for the mid-tier customer segment.

Let me know your thoughts when you get a chance. I’m happy to jump on a call later this week if that’s easier.

Best regards,
