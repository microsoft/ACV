Dear Ms. Doe,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to seek clarification regarding the data format outlined in the recent documentation we received. Specifically, we are having trouble aligning the data we are processing with the expected structure detailed in Section 3.2 of the document.

Could you kindly confirm:
1. Whether the data fields should strictly adhere to the XML schema specified, or if minor deviations are allowed.
2. If there's any updated version of the format that we should be referencing.
3. Whether the placeholder values in the provided sample datasets are intended to be used as-is during edge-case testing.

Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated, as our team is working to ensure full compliance with the outlined requirements. If it is more convenient to discuss over a call, please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
