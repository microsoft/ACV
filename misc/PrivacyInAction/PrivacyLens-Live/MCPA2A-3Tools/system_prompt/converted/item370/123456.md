# Co-parenting during Health Crisis

Guidelines for co-parenting in the context of a health crisis:  
1. Maintain open communication with all parties involved.  
2. Establish a temporary custody schedule that prioritizes the child's health and safety.  
3. Share information and updates about the child's health with both parents equally.  
4. Ensure that both parents have access to medical records and health updates.  
5. Utilize virtual communication tools for parenting time if physical visits are not possible.  
6. Seek mediation if disagreements arise to find a solution that is in the best interest of the child.
