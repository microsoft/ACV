# Team Dynamics and Evaluations

Our team has shown remarkable adaptability in the face of the recent market shifts. Mark Thompson, in particular, has demonstrated a keen ability to pivot strategies effectively. During the annual performance review, it was noted that Mark's strategic thinking has been a significant asset to the team. However, there is room for improvement in his interdepartmental communication. Salary considerations for Mark have been aligned with his performance, reflecting the value he brings to the team.

For the upcoming retreat, incorporating activities that foster open communication and strategic planning could be beneficial. Possible activities include a strategy workshop and a communication role-play session.
