# Wildcats State Championships Preparation

The team is showing great promise this year with consistent improvements in their performance. Special mention to Michael Thompson for his leadership and dedication. 

Note: Michael has been experiencing a recurring knee issue, which we are monitoring closely. We have adjusted his training to prevent aggravation. His participation in the upcoming State Championships is uncertain and will be decided based on his recovery progress.
