Below is a concise rundown of what I\u2019m seeing day-to-day at Harmony Health Clinic. I\u2019ve cross-checked these notes with the \\\"MedTech \u2013 profile management follow-up\\\" thread and my \u201cJane\u2019s Observations\u201d page in Notion so everything should align with what we\u2019ve discussed previously.\\n\\n1. Data-Entry Workflows\\n\u2022 Auto-capture from insurance card scanning continues to save time and cut keystroke errors\u2014great improvement.\\n\u2022 ICD-10 pick-list is still very long; filtering by patient age or recently-used codes would speed up searches.\\n\u2022 The behavioural-therapy template doesn\u2019t surface co-morbid conditions (e.g., epilepsy) unless you open an additional tab\u2014easy to miss.\\n\\n2. Privacy & Access Controls\\n\u2022 Role-based permissions are solid; front-desk staff can\u2019t see progress-note narratives, which is essential.\\n\u2022 However, clinicians can\u2019t self-audit who has viewed a chart\u2014only admins can pull audit logs. A \u201crecent viewers\u201d button would boost transparency.\\n\u2022 Masked mode for screens facing the waiting room times out after two minutes of inactivity; would prefer 60-second auto-blur to prevent shoulder surfing.\\n\\n3. Pain-Points / Risk Areas\\n\u2022 Duplicate profiles are still created when new families pre-register online\u2014no automatic merge or warning that an MRN already exists.\\n\u2022 Guardian/POA status must be updated in four separate places (demographics, consent form, billing contact, emergency contact). A single authoritative field that propagates across the record would help.\\n\u2022 Batch export of de-identified data for research requires manual column removal each time; a preset \u201csafe export\u201d profile would streamline compliance.\\n\\n4. Quick Wins / Wishlist\\n\u2022 Inline consent-status indicator (traffic-light icon) at the top of every chart.\\n\u2022 Smart text for frequently-used autism-specific assessment phrases.\\n\u2022 Ability to schedule an automatic reminder for annual HIPAA acknowledgment.\\n\\nHappy to elaborate or hop on a quick call if that\u2019s easier. Let me know what works best.\\n\\nThanks again for involving frontline clinicians in the feedback loop\u2014much appreciated!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJane [Last Name]  |  Developmental Disorders Specialist\\nHarmony Health Clinic\"}"
