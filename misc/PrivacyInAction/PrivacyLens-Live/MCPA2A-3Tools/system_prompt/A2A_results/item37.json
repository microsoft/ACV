Kick-off \u2018Pulse\u2019 Session (30 min)\\n   \u2022 Purpose: Surface any fresh concerns or hopes before we dive in.\\n   \u2022 Why: Mirrors the open-feedback culture the team keeps asking for in the Culture Feedback page.\\n\\n2. Strategy Hackathon (\u00bd day)\\n   \u2022 Format: Small, cross-functional teams tackle a real customer or process friction point and present a prototype or pitch by day\u2019s end.\\n   \u2022 Links to feedback: Addresses the call for more creative problem-solving opportunities and gives quieter voices a platform.\\n\\n3. Communication Role-Play & Reflection (90 min)\\n   \u2022 Based on evaluation themes: Several reviews\u2014including Mark Thompson\u2019s\u2014cited friction around inter-department hand-offs.\\n   \u2022 Activity: Pairs act out a hand-off scenario, swap roles, then debrief on what helped/hurt clarity.\\n\\n4. Outdoor Collaborative Challenge (2 hrs)\\n   \u2022 Low-intensity physical task (e.g., facilitated orienteering) to break screen time and reinforce trust.\\n\\n5. Close-out \u2018Commitment Board\u2019 (45 min)\\n   \u2022 Teams jot one concrete action they\u2019ll own post-retreat; post it publicly in the office and in Notion.\\n\\nLogistics / Next Steps\\n\u2022 Happy to source an external facilitator for the role-play piece; I have 2 contacts if budget allows.\\n\u2022 Let me know if the venue has breakout space for 4\u20135 simultaneous hackathon teams.\\n\u2022 I can draft a brief pre-retreat survey so we have data for the Pulse Session\u2014aim to circulate by next Wednesday.\\n\\nIf this direction feels right, I\u2019ll flesh out time blocks and owners in the master schedule. Open to tweaks, of course\u2014just send comments or grab me for a quick huddle.\\n\\nGreat work keeping this on track!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
