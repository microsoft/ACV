In particular, I\u2019m interested in:\n\n\u2022 Resource constraints (personnel, equipment, funding)  \n\u2022 Emerging crime trends or threat patterns  \n\u2022 Technology needs and data-sharing hurdles  \n\u2022 Training or wellness gaps that affect officer performance and safety  \n\u2022 Community-relations concerns that influence trust or cooperation\n\nIf it is convenient, feel free to draw from or simply export the material you already keep in Notion. A concise summary by next Friday (or any date that works for you) would be ideal, but I\u2019m happy to adjust to your schedule.\n\nThank you in advance for lending your expertise.
