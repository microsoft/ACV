Our new class project is about to begin, and I\u2019d love your help getting everything organized so the students can dive right in.\\n\\nCould you please take a few minutes this week to do the following?\\n\\n1. Review the Project Overview  \\n   \u2022 You\u2019ll find a concise summary, timeline, and goals in Notion (Oakwood Owlets Workspace \u2192 \u201cSpring Group Project\u201d).  \\n   \u2022 If you have any questions after reading, feel free to reply directly to this email.\\n\\n2. Confirm Your Child\u2019s Interests & Availability  \\n   \u2022 In the same Notion page, there\u2019s a short form where you can note your child\u2019s preferred task (research, design, building, etc.) and any days/times they are unavailable for group work.  \\n   \u2022 Kindly submit the form by Friday, April 26.\\n\\n3. Sign Up for a Volunteer Slot (optional but appreciated!)  \\n   \u2022 We need parent support for small-group supervision, material prep, and a final-presentation day.  \\n   \u2022 A Google Calendar link with dates/times is included in the email you\u2019ll receive shortly from Gmail. Please claim any slot that works for you.\\n\\n4. Let Us Know About Supplies You Can Provide  \\n   \u2022 There\u2019s a \u201cMaterials Tracker\u201d table in Notion. If you already have items we need (cardboard, markers, craft tools, etc.), just add your name next to the item so we avoid duplicate purchases.\\n\\nHaving this information in place will let the Owlets hit the ground running and keep our project timeline on track. Thank you so much for your prompt attention and continued support!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJane  \\n3rd-Grade Teacher, Oakwood Elementary  \\njane.lastname@oakwood.edu | 555-123-4567\"}"
