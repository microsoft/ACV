Review any relevant threads in our shared Gmail labels (\u201cOffice Renovation,\u201d \u201cErgonomics,\u201d \u201cWorkflow Updates\u201d) and the \u201cOffice Improvements\u201d and \u201cProcess Changes\u201d pages in Notion.  \n2. Send me a brief bullet-point update (or, if easier, add your notes directly to the corresponding Notion page) covering:\n   \u2022 Status of construction or layout changes (including estimated completion dates)  \n   \u2022 New ergonomic accommodations (e.g., Sarah\u2019s workstation needs)  \n   \u2022 Accessibility improvements (e.g., Jane\u2019s hearing-related requests)  \n   \u2022 Any changes to team workflows, tooling, or project hand-offs  \n   \u2022 Key dates or action items the broader staff should know\n\nPlease aim to have your updates to me by 3 p.m. tomorrow so I can consolidate everything and circulate the finalized notice to all staff before the end of the week.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ping me on Slack or drop a comment in Notion.
