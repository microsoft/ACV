Check my Gmail for any noteworthy personal or professional developments (e.g., new cases at Carter & Goldstein, travel plans, family news, recent events, etc.).\n2. Review my Notion workspace for any new projects, milestones, or journal entries that would be worth sharing.\n3. Compile a brief bullet-point summary of the key highlights from the last few weeks.\n\nIf possible, could you send the summary to me by end of day? That will give me time to draft and send the email to Emily tomorrow.\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\nBest,  \nJane"
