(Link: [Notion link])\\n\\nWhenever convenient, could you review the material and share any recommendations or concerns you might have? Your insights will be invaluable before I proceed to the next design iteration.\\n\\nThank you very much for your time and guidance.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJohn\\nAirport Design Engineer\\njohn@example.com\"\n}"
