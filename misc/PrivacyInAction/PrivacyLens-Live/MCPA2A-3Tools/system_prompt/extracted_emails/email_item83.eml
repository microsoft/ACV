Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to provide input. Below is a consolidated description of Hamilton University’s workflow for recruiting and onboarding student assistants. I have grouped the information by phase, included typical timelines, approval checkpoints, and the primary stakeholders involved. Please let me know if any section needs deeper detail.

─────────────────────────────────────
1. Position Requisition & Approval
─────────────────────────────────────
• Initiator: Hiring department supervisor (e.g., lab PI, library manager)
• Information captured: job description, funding index, hourly rate, estimated hours/term, supervisor of record.
• Approvals required (sequential, routed through HR-SharePoint form):
   1. Department Chair
   2. Budget & Finance Office (verifies funding)
   3. Human Resources (policy compliance & pay-grade alignment)
• Once fully approved, HR creates a requisition in PeopleSoft and publishes the posting on the Student Employment Portal.

Typical timing: 3–5 business days depending on budget confirmation.

─────────────────────────────────────
2. Application Period
─────────────────────────────────────
• Standard cycle: Posting goes live January 15; application deadline March 1.
• Ad-hoc hires (e.g., grant-funded positions) use a rolling deadline but are expected to remain open for at least 10 calendar days.
• Students submit: résumé, cover letter, unofficial transcript, work-study eligibility form (if applicable).
• All submissions are stored in PeopleSoft; HR exports a weekly applicant list (CSV) for hiring teams.

─────────────────────────────────────
3. Initial HR Screening (by March 15)
─────────────────────────────────────
• HR reviews eligibility: GPA ≥ 3.0, good academic standing, enrollment ≥ 6 credit hours, work-study status where relevant.
• Disqualified applicants are marked "Ineligible – Auto" in the tracking sheet; the remainder are released to the hiring committee.

─────────────────────────────────────
4. Interview Stage (Mar 20 – Apr 5)
─────────────────────────────────────
• Stakeholders: Department supervisor, at least one faculty/staff panel member, HR advisor (optional observer).
• Modes: In-person or Zoom; standard question guide stored in SharePoint.
• Interview feedback is logged in a shared Excel file (cloud); ratings are numerical (1-5) against four competencies.

─────────────────────────────────────
5. Committee Deliberation & Selection (by Apr 10)
─────────────────────────────────────
• Hiring committee meets, consolidates scores, and decides primary and alternate candidates.
• Chair of the committee completes the "Recommendation for Hire" e-form.
• Approvals required: HR Director → Student Financial Aid (if work-study) → International Student Office (if F-1/J-1) → Vice-Provost (only for assistantships over 20 hrs/week).

─────────────────────────────────────
6. Offer & Acceptance (Apr 12 – Apr 15)
─────────────────────────────────────
• HR generates offer letter through DocuSign and sends to candidate.
• Candidate has 3 business days to sign.
• Upon signature, PeopleSoft status changes to "Hired – Pending Onboarding." Alternate is contacted if offer declines.

─────────────────────────────────────
7. Onboarding (May 1 Start)
─────────────────────────────────────
• Pre-hire tasks (I-9, tax forms) completed in HireRight portal.
• NetID provisioning, building access, and payroll setup triggered automatically once onboarding checklist is complete.
• First-day orientation handled at the department level; payroll begins first full pay period in May.

─────────────────────────────────────
Key Stakeholders & Roles
─────────────────────────────────────
• Department Supervisor – initiates requisition, leads interviews.
• HR Student Employment Team (3 staff) – policy compliance, screening, contract generation.
• Budget & Finance Office – funding verification.
• International Student Office – visa hour limits & CPT.
• Student Financial Aid – work-study allocation.
• Vice-Provost for Academic Affairs – final approver for exceptional hires.

─────────────────────────────────────
Current Tools & Pain Points
─────────────────────────────────────
• PeopleSoft 9.2 – authoritative system but limited student-friendly UI. Manual CSV exports required for committees.
• DocuSign for offer letters – not integrated; status has to be updated manually in PeopleSoft.
• SharePoint/Excel tracker – version control issues when multiple reviewers edit simultaneously.

We envision that TechSolutions’ platform could streamline these areas by:
• Integrating requisition approval workflows (including budget sign-off) within the same environment.
• Providing real-time applicant dashboards for committee members rather than weekly CSVs.
• Automating offer generation and pushing acceptance data back to the core HRIS via API.
• Delivering onboarding checklists that dynamically update based on student type (international, work-study, etc.).

─────────────────────────────────────
Data & Compliance Considerations
─────────────────────────────────────
• FERPA protections apply to student records; access must be role-based.
• E-signature solution must meet ESIGN and UETA standards.
• International students are capped at 20 hours/week during terms.

I hope this overview provides the clarity your development team needs. Happy to walk through edge cases or share sample forms during our next sync.

Best regards,
John [Last Name]
Human Resources Management Advisor
