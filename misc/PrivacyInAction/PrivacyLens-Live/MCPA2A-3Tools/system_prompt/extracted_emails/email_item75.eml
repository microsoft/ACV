Hi John,

As requested, I’ve reviewed your recent Gmail threads with discharge planners/oncology teams and the Patient-Support workspace in Notion. Below is a concise outline of elderly patients who appear to need additional community support. I have flagged any time-sensitive items in RED.

1. Mrs. Linda Smith
   • Diagnosis / Current Status: Post-operative recovery following hip-replacement surgery; attending outpatient physical therapy.
   • Support Needs: Reliable transportation to PT sessions (2×/week) for the next 6–8 weeks; possible home-safety evaluation once fully weight-bearing.
   • Upcoming Appointments: Next PT visit – Tuesday, 2 July at 10 a.m.
   • Urgency: Moderate – transportation should be arranged before Monday.

2. Mr. George Brown
   • Diagnosis / Current Status: Multiple chronic conditions (HTN, CHF) and increasing social isolation; lives alone.
   • Support Needs: Companionship / friendly visitor program, phone check-ins 2-3× weekly; possible enrollment in senior day-program.
   • Upcoming Appointments: Primary-care follow-up – Friday, 5 July at 9 a.m. (could combine with transport assistance if available).
   • Urgency: Low-to-moderate – earlier engagement may prevent further decline in mood.

3. Mr. Harold Thompson  ← URGENT
   • Diagnosis / Current Status: Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer (per 26 Jun oncology note). Emotionally overwhelmed; limited family nearby.
   • Support Needs: Transportation to chemo consults, meal-delivery during treatment weeks, in-home aide for ADLs as fatigue develops.
   • Upcoming Appointments: Oncology treatment-planning meeting – Monday, 1 July at 2 p.m.  ***Time-sensitive: transport must be confirmed by Friday.***
   • Urgency: HIGH – first oncology appointment in 4 days; support coordination is critical.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional detail or edits. Once you approve, I can format this for Sarah at Helping Hands.

Best,
[Your Name]
(on behalf of John, Social Worker, Mercy General Hospital)
