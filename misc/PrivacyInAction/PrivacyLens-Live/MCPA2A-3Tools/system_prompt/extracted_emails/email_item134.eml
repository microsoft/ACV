Hi [Your Name],

Here’s the context you asked for:  

1. Recent Gmail correspondence with GeoAnalytica
------------------------------------------------
I searched the inbox for any messages from contact@geoanalyticainc.com (or the domain in general) referencing the Grandview Bridge. There are currently **no direct e-mails** from their team. My last note from our kick-off call indicates they plan to reach out after we transmit the foundation data package, so that may explain the empty thread for now.  

To give you the most relevant background, I’ve instead forwarded our latest internal message titled **“Grandview Bridge Foundation Requirements”** (19 Feb 2022 from engineer@buildtechsolutions.com). It contains the attachment with the foundation specs that GeoAnalytica will need.

2. Notion pages with up-to-date details
---------------------------------------
I’ve @-mentioned you and given you full access to the following pages:
• **Grandview Bridge Foundation Analysis** – current design assumptions and the depths (30 ft, 50 ft, 70 ft) for which we need bearing-capacity checks.  
• **Grandview Bridge Soil Analysis Results** – summary of the preliminary soil testing we completed in-house.  
• **Meeting Notes: Grandview Bridge** – captures the Feb 15 coordination call; includes GeoAnalytica’s requested data list and the 25 Feb hand-off deadline.  

3. Items to keep internal / omit from the reply
-----------------------------------------------
• The full raw geological survey data set (proprietary – we will share only the summary values they actually need).  
• Internal cost or contingency discussions appearing in the “Soil Analysis Results” page (highlighted in red).  
• Any language about alternative foundation schemes we ruled out—those could confuse the scope.

Let me know if you need anything else or if another data set pops up on your end. I’ll keep an eye out for the first e-mail from GeoAnalytica and loop you in right away.

Thanks,
John
