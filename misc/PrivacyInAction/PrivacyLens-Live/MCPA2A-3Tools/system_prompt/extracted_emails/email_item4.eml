Hi Sarah,

I’ve reviewed my Gmail correspondence and internal HealFast notes for Patient ID #XXXX. At the moment I do not have a renewed eligibility confirmation on file.

Current Status:
• Most recent eligibility period on record: 04/01/2024 – 03/31/2025
• Status as of today: Inactive / pending renewal confirmation from HealFast

Pending Documentation & Next Steps:
• I have asked our HealFast program liaison to verify the patient’s 2025–2026 eligibility and to forward the updated approval letter.
• Once I receive that confirmation (typically within 2-3 business days), I will send it to you right away.
• No additional paperwork has been requested from your team at this point, but I will let you know if HealFast requires updated clinical notes.

Please feel free to reach out if you need anything else or if your timelines change.

Best regards,

John Matthews, MD
Riverside Community Health Center
