Hi Team,

Could someone please pull together the materials that Dr. Emily Strauss at GenetiCore Research Inc. (research@geneticore.com) needs for the genetic-predisposition study?

What we need
1. The latest version of the aggregated, fully de-identified dataset.
2. The accompanying data-dictionary / codebook.
3. Any brief methodology or cohort-selection notes we usually send with the dataset.
4. Expected date of the next scheduled data refresh (if known).

Where to look
• Gmail – thread titled “Data Request – GenetiCore” (initial message from Dr. Strauss dated 3 May) contains the checklist she provided.
• Notion – workspace → “Research Collaborations” → “GenetiCore / Data Deliverables” page holds the most recent export and documentation.

Please confirm once everything is compiled (or let me know if anything is missing) so I can forward the package to Dr. Strauss today.

Thank you!

Best,
Jane
