Hi Lisa,

Thank you for getting in touch.

I’ve reviewed our current and scheduled listings for the next week, and at the moment we do not have any active or upcoming discount programs that specifically cover tech accessories, small home appliances, or smart-home gadgets. Likewise, we don’t have early-access or limited-quantity bundles slated for those categories in the same time frame.

I understand this isn’t the news you were hoping for, and I’ll continue to monitor new promotions closely. If anything changes—or if a supplier releases a last-minute coupon code—I’ll let you know immediately so you can pass it along to John before the promotion goes public.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions or if there’s another way we can help.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
