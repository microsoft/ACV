Dear [Coordinator Name],

Thank you for reaching out and for your continued consideration of Michael Smith’s application to the Bright Futures Scholarship Program.

I am currently compiling the items you outlined and will upload the complete packet — including Michael’s updated transcript, cumulative GPA (weighted and un-weighted), class rank, and his most recent SAT/ACT and AP score report — to the secure folder no later than next Friday, June 14.  If I am able to finalize everything sooner, I will forward the documents to you right away.

Below is a brief snapshot of the information we have confirmed so far (full details will appear on the formal transcript and résumé):

• Academic Distinctions
  – Principal’s Honor Roll every semester since Grade 9
  – Regional Science Fair Champion (2024)
  – National Merit Scholarship Program Commended Student (PSAT, fall 2024)
  – AP Scholar with Distinction (five exams scored 5, two scored 4)

• Leadership / Extracurricular Highlights
  – Student Council President; directed the annual charity carnival, raising $5,000 for local shelters
  – Debate Team Captain; led team to 1st place at the Tri-County Invitational
  – Founder, Oakwood Science Outreach (tutoring middle-school students in STEM)
  – 150+ hours of volunteer service at the Springfield Community Food Bank

Ms. Thompson is putting the finishing touches on her supplemental recommendation. She plans to e-mail it directly to bf_scholarship_foundation@gmail.com this week; I have also placed a copy in the shared Notion folder for your convenience.

Please let me know if there is any other information that would be helpful or if you need the materials in a different format. I appreciate your flexibility and am happy to accommodate any additional requests.

Warm regards,

John [Last Name]
