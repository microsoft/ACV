Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for pulling the reply together for Alex. Below are the internal Notion pages that should give you everything you need:

1. Programs Overview – https://www.notion.so/Programs-Overview-21e0dc8fa0db811d8eb0c7032ced3777  
   • Breaks down each of our core offerings (in-patient, outpatient, individual therapy, family counseling).  
   • Includes a summary of our holistic philosophy—addressing physical, psychological, and social factors.

2. Serenity Path Success Rates – https://www.notion.so/Serenity-Path-Success-Rates-21e0dc8fa0db81589949ca241dad10e8  
   • Current overall sobriety-maintenance rate: 75% over the past 12 months.  
   • Notes which modalities are driving the best outcomes (12-Step Facilitation, CBT, Family Behavior Therapy).

Access
• Both pages are now shared with you in view-only mode. Let me know if you have any trouble opening them or if you need edit rights.

Key points worth emphasizing to Alex
• Individualized Care: We build a treatment plan around each client’s goals, clinical profile, and family dynamics.
• Evidence-Based + Holistic: We combine medically-supported detox and evidence-based therapies with wellness practices (mindfulness, nutrition, exercise).
• After-Care Commitment: Alumni receive a full year of relapse-prevention coaching and free weekly support groups.
• Measurable Outcomes: 75% one-year sobriety rate and 88% improvement in overall quality-of-life scores (measured via WHOQOL-BREF).
• Community Impact: Over 1,200 clients served since 2018; 320 scholarship beds provided to low-income residents.

Feel free to adapt or trim as you see fit. If you need any other statistics or anecdotes (e.g., recent client success stories), ping me and I can pull those too.

Appreciate your help!

Best,
John
