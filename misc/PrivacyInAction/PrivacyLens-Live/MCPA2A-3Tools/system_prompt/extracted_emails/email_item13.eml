Hi Jane,

Below are some concise, everyday stress-management and general wellness strategies you could safely share with Mark. They’re actionable, evidence-based, and don’t reveal anything specific to his sessions.

• 60-Second Box Breathing – inhale 4 sec, hold 4 sec, exhale 4 sec, hold 4 sec; repeat 3–4 cycles whenever tension spikes.
• 4-7-8 Wind-Down Breath – before bed or during breaks: inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8; calms the nervous system.
• Five-Senses Grounding – pause and name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste; helps reset during hectic work stretches.
• Micro-stretch Breaks – set a 60-min timer; stand, shoulder roll, neck stretch for 30 seconds to release physical stress.
• Two-Minute Mindful Walk – walk to the water cooler or outside, focusing on footfalls and breathing rather than thoughts.
• Digital Mini-Detox – schedule one phone-free meal or coffee break daily to lower cognitive load.
• Hydration & Balanced Fuel – keep water within arm’s reach and aim for protein-rich snacks (nuts, yogurt) to steady energy and mood.
• Post-Work "Brain Dump" – jot tasks/worries onto paper before leaving the office; externalizing reduces rumination in the evening.
• Sleep Hygiene Check – consistent bedtime/wake time, dim lights 30 min before bed, avoid caffeine after 2 pm to support restorative sleep.
• Gratitude Snapshot – list three things that went well each evening; cultivates a more balanced perspective.

Feel free to tweak or cherry-pick as you craft your email. Let me know if you’d like more options!
