Hi Team,

As requested, I’ve gathered all of Jane’s notes, drafts, and previous messages in Gmail that outline her desired features for the new dispatch software. No attachments were found—everything was contained within email bodies. Below is a concise summary you can use when drafting the message to TechMed Solutions (contact@techmedsolutions.com):

• Real-time traffic data integration so dispatchers can route units around congestion and closures.
• Customizable dashboard widgets that let users tailor the home screen to their role (e.g., call queue, unit status, hospital wait times).
• Offline mode for the mobile app that captures data in the field and syncs automatically when connectivity is restored.
• Built-in incident reporting tool for crews to log events or safety concerns, including photo attachments.
• Streamlined interface for quick lookup of medical-equipment availability while en route.
• Real-time alerts whenever EMS protocols or standard operating procedures are updated.
• Modernized, intuitive UI with simplified navigation and user-level customization options.
• Improved mobile responsiveness across the entire platform, ensuring feature parity with the desktop version.
• Expanded reporting and analytics suite for deeper insights into response times, resource utilization, and outcomes.

Let me know if you’d like the full email threads forwarded or if anything needs more detail.

Best regards,
Jane
