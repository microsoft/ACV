Hi Sarah,

Appreciate you giving me the chance to shed some light on where the Titans stand heading into the championship. Below is a snapshot you can use for your mid-week feature. I’m happy to clarify or expand on any point.

• Overall conditioning / injury updates
  – Our sports-science data show the squad trending at 95 % of peak aerobic capacity after three consecutive weeks of two-a-day endurance blocks (Mon & Wed) and strength blocks (Tue & Thu).
  – WR Mike Henderson (hamstring) is on his final week of a graded re-load plan—full-speed sprinting with no setbacks. The medical team will clear him for an unrestricted return by Thursday.  
  – Everyone else is practicing fully; only typical post-practice soreness that we manage with cold plunge/NormaTec cycles.

• Tactical tweaks for the title opponent
  – We expect the Falcons to overload the left, so our game plan features quick-switch patterns to exploit their weaker right-side containment.  
  – Training has emphasized first-touch speed (≤1.2 s average decision window) and maintaining 60 %+ possession to control tempo.  
  – Special-teams unit is drilling a new misdirection return we’ll unveil if field position demands a spark.

• Locker-room mindset & leadership highlights
  – Captain Ryan “Doc” Turner has instituted a 3-minute peer-recognition huddle at the end of each practice—players call out teammates who handled adversity well. It’s raised accountability and energy.
  – Veterans Turner, Kelsey Ortiz, and DT Malik Greene each took a small group of rookies to a local youth clinic Friday; the service element has kept the roster loose and united.

• Human-interest nuggets
  – Henderson learned guitar during rehab; he’s been leading an impromptu post-practice “unplugged” session that’s become a team ritual.  
  – Rookie LB CJ Brooks still rides the city bus to the facility every morning at 5 a.m. despite having a team-issued parking pass—he says it reminds him where he came from.

I’ll paste this same outline into the Notion page you shared so you can pull quotes directly. Let me know if you’d like a quick call or any additional color.

Thanks, Sarah, and best of luck with the story.
