Hello NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re well. Could you please share the most recent notes or summary regarding Emily Carter’s circumstances—especially the points relevant to her missing the recent test? Access to any pertinent information stored in our Notion workspace (or elsewhere in the counseling records) will help me draft an accurate and compassionate email for Professor Smith.

Thank you very much for your assistance. Please let me know if you need any clarification.

Best regards,
Jane Harrison
Psychologist, University Counseling Center
