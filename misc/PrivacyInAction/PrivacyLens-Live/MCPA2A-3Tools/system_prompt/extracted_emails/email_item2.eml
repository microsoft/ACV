Hi Emily,

I’m forwarding you some of the most relevant material from my Notion workspace that should help with the anxiety-focused cases you’ve been handling. All three pages are now shared with your Greenleaf address for view-only access.

1. Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety  
   https://www.notion.so/Cognitive-Behavioral-Techniques-for-Anxiety-21e0dc8fa0db819b93d4daa1990ca4cd  
   • One-page overview of CBT’s core components for anxiety (exposure hierarchy, cognitive restructuring worksheet, coping cards).  
   • Printable thought-record template & sample homework assignment.  

2. Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders  
   https://www.notion.so/Personal-Workspace-1f00dc8fa0db809ea302d103fbfc769d#21e0dc8f-a0db-8188-b618-e22ba3a3cead  
   • Curated list of evidence-based texts and articles.  
   • Top picks: “The Anxiety & Worry Workbook,” “Mind Over Mood (2nd ed.),” assorted open-access journal articles on transdiagnostic CBT.  

3. Grounding & Relaxation Exercise Examples (excerpt from case notes)  
   https://www.notion.so/Mr-David-Thompson-Detailed-Session-Notes-21e0dc8fa0db81308726fea1db01bce7  
   • 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding script.  
   • Step-by-step diaphragmatic-breathing cue sheet.  
   • Progressive-muscle-relaxation protocol (10-minute version).  

Feel free to pull language or handouts directly into your reply draft. If you need anything tweaked or additional psychoeducation materials (e.g., worry time worksheet or safety-behaviour log), just let me know and I can upload them today.

Hope this helps!

Best,
John
