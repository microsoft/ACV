Hi [Your Name],

Below is the feedback I’ve drafted for Michael’s current manuscript draft. It’s pulled directly from my Notion notes so everything is up-to-date.

—
Working Title: (Michael to confirm)

Overall Impressions
• The character development in this latest draft has improved significantly. Michael’s portrayal of complex relationships is nuanced and compelling.

Structural / Pacing Notes
• The pacing in the third act slows the narrative momentum. Consider tightening or trimming some of the reflective passages between Chapters 22–26 to keep tension high as we move toward the climax.

Next Steps
• Once Michael has a chance to address the pacing edits, I’d be happy to do a line-level pass that focuses on rhythm and dialogue polish.
• Let me know when he’d like these comments formally annotated in the manuscript; I can turn the bullets above into in-line suggestions in Track Changes.

Feel free to forward this to Michael or let me know if either of you would like to discuss any point in more depth.

Best,
Jane
