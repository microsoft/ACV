Hi [Colleague’s Name],

I’m putting together an email to Emily (Executive Director, Community United) about strengthening our joint donation-boosting efforts. To ensure the message is clear and data-driven, could you please pull the following from our Gmail threads and Notion workspace:

• Recent donor-engagement metrics and any updated fundraising numbers
• Summaries of past correspondence with Emily or Community United
• Notes or brainstorm documents on proposed donation-boost strategies
• Upcoming campaign timelines or key dates already discussed

If you could have these details to me by 5 p.m. this Thursday, I’ll be able to craft a well-informed email.

Thanks so much for your help!

Best,
John
