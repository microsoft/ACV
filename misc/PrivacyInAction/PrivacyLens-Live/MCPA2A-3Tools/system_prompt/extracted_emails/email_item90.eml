Hi Jane,

Below is a roundup of everything I could locate in our Gmail threads and Notion workspace concerning the joint counseling initiative with Helping Hands Alliance.

1. Confirmed program name & launch timeline
   • A formal program name has NOT been finalized in either Gmail or Notion.
   • No explicit launch timeline is recorded yet – only general language about “upcoming collaboration” and the need to create a training schedule.

2. Key objectives & deliverables captured so far
   • Provide community-based counseling services in partnership with Helping Hands Alliance.
   • Finalise list of St. Mary’s volunteers who will take part.
   • Create and roll-out volunteer training sessions (content still TBD).
   • Explore incorporating general counseling advice and resources into volunteer training.

3. Important dates on record
   • A preliminary planning meeting with Mark (referenced in the Notion page) – date not listed.
   • No milestones or training session dates have been specified yet in email or Notion.

4. Roles & responsibilities (current notes)
   • St. Mary’s Church:
        – Recruit and manage volunteers.
        – Provide venue space for counseling sessions if required.
        – Lead development of the volunteer training curriculum.
   • Helping Hands Alliance:
        – Supply professional counselors / subject-matter expertise.
        – Assist in designing training content.
        – Coordinate referral pathways and intake procedures.
   (These points are inferred from the Notion “Joint Initiative Planning” page; they have not been formally documented in email.)

5. Talking points / attachments
   • No budgets, outlines, or one-pagers are attached to any email thread.
   • The Notion “Joint Initiative Planning” page is currently the only written outline; you may wish to export it as a PDF or share the link with Mark once it contains fuller details.

What seems to be missing
   • Formal program name and branding.
   • Confirmed launch / roll-out timeline and milestone calendar.
   • A written MOU or at least a one-pager capturing objectives, scope, roles, and budget.
   • Any budget estimates or resource allocation plan.

Next steps you might consider before emailing Mark
   1. Decide on a working programme title you’re happy to float.
   2. Propose a target launch month (e.g., “early May”) and a date for the next coordination meeting.
   3. Draft a simple 1-page overview (objectives, deliverables, roles, timeline) to attach.

I’ll keep monitoring both Gmail and Notion; let me know if another keyword or thread might uncover more.

Best,
[Assistant]
