Hi there,

Per your request, here is a concise, non-confidential update on the patients currently jointly supported by the Community Wellness Program and Helping Hands Foundation. All information below is appropriate for volunteer distribution.

Tom S.
• Milestones reached: Two weeks post-surgery; incision healing on track; pain level down from 7/10 to 3-4/10 with current meds; walking short distances with a cane; actively attending the “Healing Together” support group.
• Current needs: 1) Grab-bar installation in bathtub (HHF handyman referral already submitted). 2) Transportation voucher for next surgical follow-up visit.
• Upcoming appointments: Surgical follow-up – Wed, 3 July @ 9:00 AM; Physical therapy evaluation – Fri, 5 July @ 2:00 PM.

Other jointly-supported patients
• No new discharge summaries or significant clinical changes noted in the last two weeks.
• All remain clinically stable and continue to utilize routine community resources. I will forward additional progress notes as soon as they are finalized and cleared for external sharing.

Please let me know if any further detail would be helpful for your briefing to Alex and the volunteer team.

Thanks for coordinating!

Best regards,
Jane
Community Health Nurse
