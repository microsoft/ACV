Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’re doing well and enjoying your well-deserved retirement.

I’m writing to share a quick progress update on the Heathrow Terminal 5 satellite-pier expansion I’m currently leading and, as always, to ask for your candid feedback.

Highlights so far
• 30 % concept design package submitted to HAL on schedule last week.
• Passenger-flow simulations indicate a 9 % dwell-time reduction versus the 2019 baseline.
• Early discussions with CAA show a positive response to the proposed dual-taxi-lane geometry.
• Biggest current challenge: integrating the new APM station without compromising stand availability during construction phasing.

To keep the email concise, I’ve posted full drawings, phasing diagrams, and the updated risk register in my Notion workspace:

I’d be grateful if you could glance through the package at your convenience and let me know:
1. Whether the midfield apron phasing feels realistic from an operations standpoint.
2. Any red flags you see in our vertical-circulation strategy for the A380 gates.
3. Suggestions on mitigating the temporary bussing requirement in Q3 2026.

Your guidance has always helped me anticipate issues early, and I’d value any thoughts you have—however brief.

Thank you for taking the time, and please let me know if a short call would be easier; I’ll gladly work around your schedule.

Warm regards,

Jane
