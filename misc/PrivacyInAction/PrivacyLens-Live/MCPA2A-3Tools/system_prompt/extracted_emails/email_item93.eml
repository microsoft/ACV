Hi [Your Name],

Great to meet you, and welcome to the Downtown Highrise team! I’m looking forward to partnering with ConstructCo Solutions on this project.

Requested project materials
———————————————
Below is an overview of where each of the items you listed can be found. I’m granting you view-/comment-level access today and will send a separate email with direct share links so your teammates can jump in immediately.

1. Project overview & scope: Notion → “Downtown Highrise / 01 ‑ Project Charter & Scope”
2. Design drawings / technical specs: Google Drive → “DH ‑ IFC Drawings” & “DH ‑ Spec Book Rev 3” (both synced to Notion as well)
3. Master schedule & key milestones: Notion → “Downtown Highrise / 02 ‑ Master Schedule” (Gantt view). The “No-Later-Than” dates are highlighted in red.
4. Site logistics plan: Google Drive → “DH ‑ Site Logistics (PDF + DWG)”
5. Permits & compliance docs: Notion database “Permits Tracker” (all current approvals uploaded; new submissions auto-populate here).
6. Subcontractor coordination matrix & contact list: Notion table “Coordination Matrix – Rev B”. I’ve pre-populated ConstructCo’s main contacts—feel free to update if anything changes.
7. Notion workspace access: You now have access to the full “Downtown Highrise” space. Let me know if any pages are still restricted.
8. Recent decision threads: I’ll add you to the Gmail label “DH – Decisions & Action Items” this afternoon; that will pull in all prior conversations for quick reference.

Kick-off call
————————
Wednesday at 1:30 PM works perfectly. I’ll send a calendar invite (Google Meet) shortly. If anything comes up, just let me know and we can adjust.

Next steps
———————
• Please confirm once the links are working on your end.
• Ahead of the call, take a quick look at the Master Schedule and jot down any sequencing questions so we can tackle them early.

Thanks again, and let’s make this a smooth start!

Best,
