Hi NotionManager Team,

I’m drafting an email for Mark Johnson about the upcoming Helping Hands charity gala and need to make sure I include the most up-to-date information.

Could you please share (or point me to) the following details from the Notion workspace, calendar, or relevant docs?

• Date, start/end time, and venue address  
• Full agenda / run-of-show, including Mr. Thomas Anderson’s speaking slot  
• Current guest list or RSVP status, plus any VIP notes  
• Sponsor information (confirmed and pending)  
• Key talking points, promotional materials, or press-ready blurbs  
• Dress code, parking, and any other logistical instructions

Anything else you think Mark should see would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,  
Jane Smith
