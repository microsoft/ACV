Hi Alex,

I enjoyed our chat at the Global Tech Innovators Conference and our brief email exchange afterward. I’d love to keep the momentum going.

1. Could you share a few of the emerging technology trends you’re currently most excited about—or any recent articles, research, or case studies you’ve found insightful?
2. If GlobalTech is involved in any upcoming projects or events related to these trends, I’d be interested to learn more (dates, brief details, or links are welcome).

Feel free to reply here or drop anything into the shared Notion workspace—whichever is easier. I’ll keep an eye on my inbox and Notion notifications.

Looking forward to your insights!

Best regards,
Jane
