Hi [Your Name],

Below is the information you asked for. Let me know if you need anything else before you finalize the response for Alex.

--------------------------------------------------
Quick links to key Notion pages

--------------------------------------------------
Recent policy updates / pilots / data highlights
--------------------------------------------------
1. No material policy changes since the January 2025 revision of the Risk-Triage Matrix (already reflected in the Overview page).
2. Trauma-Informed Court Report pilot formally wrapped in March. Internal evaluation underway; no public findings yet, so I’d reference it only in broad terms.
3. FY-24 statistics you might pull from the Annual CPS Statistics page:
   • 1,200 total investigations opened (↑9% YoY)
   • Avg. time from intake to initial face-to-face contact: 27 hrs
   • Avg. life of a case: 180 days

--------------------------------------------------
Top operational challenges suitable for publication
--------------------------------------------------
• High caseloads – front-line workers average 30 open cases each, well above the recommended 17-20. This impacts response time and depth of follow-up.
• Resource scarcity – limited foster placements and stretched support services (especially behavioral-health providers) slow permanency planning.
• Workforce resilience – burnout and turnover remain concerns; we have a 22 % annual social-worker attrition rate despite new wellness supports.

--------------------------------------------------
Items to keep off-the-record / require exec sign-off
--------------------------------------------------
• Any references to specific families or children (e.g., Timothy’s Case or any identifiable scenario).
• Detailed findings from the Trauma-Informed Court Report pilot until the evaluation is cleared by leadership.
• Internal metrics on staff mental-health utilization or overtime costs.

Hope this helps. If Alex needs further clarification on procedures, I can hop on a quick call or supply redacted process maps.

Best,
Jane
