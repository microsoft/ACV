Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well!

Our next Academic Alliance study session is on the calendar. For full details (date, time, location, and preliminary agenda), please check:

• The recent Gmail thread labeled “Study Session – Upcoming”
• Jane’s Genius Planner entry titled “Academic Alliance: Next Study Session”

To help me finalize arrangements, could each of you please:

1. Confirm your attendance (Yes / No)
2. Let me know any topics, questions, or resources you’d like added to the agenda

Kindly reply by Thursday at 5 p.m. so I can lock everything in and circulate the final schedule.

Thank you very much, and I look forward to seeing everyone at the session!

Best regards,

Jane
