We usually meet every few weeks for informal dinners, game nights, or a local meetup event\u2014nothing too formal. The common threads are openness, willingness to share ideas, and supporting each other\u2019s personal and professional growth, so our conversations jump from new product trends to travel stories and everything in between.\\n\\nIf there\u2019s something specific you\u2019d like to know\u2014such as typical gathering formats, upcoming events, or introductions in a particular field\u2014just let me know and I\u2019ll gladly help or connect you with the right person.\\n\\nWe\u2019re always happy to welcome new perspectives, so once we finalize the next get-together I\u2019ll keep you posted.\\n\\nFeel free to let me know what would be most helpful.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"}"
