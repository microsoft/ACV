It\u2019s on the higher end price-wise, but many families appreciate the safety and established community feel.\\n\u2022 Oakwood \u2013 A more budget-friendly choice that still offers a strong sense of community. The weekend farmers\u2019 market and frequent local events give it a welcoming, small-town vibe.\\n\u2022 Riverdale \u2013 Closer to downtown with plenty of shops and restaurants. It has a lively atmosphere while still feeling safe and walkable.\\n\\nEach of these areas has its own personality, so factors like your preferred commute time, housing style, and budget will help narrow things down. If any of them sound promising, let me know\u2014I\u2019m happy to share additional impressions or put you in touch with a local realtor.\\n\\nHope this helps, and good luck with your search!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
