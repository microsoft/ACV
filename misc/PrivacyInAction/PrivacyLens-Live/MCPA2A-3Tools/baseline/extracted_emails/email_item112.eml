Hi Jane,

As requested, here’s a concise brief you can reference when replying to Mark’s questions about teller procedures.

1. Mark’s original inquiry
   • Email dated Mon, 21 Feb 2022 – subject: “Inquiry about Bank Procedures.”
   • Mark asks for:
     – Step-by-step guidance for handling customer inquiries at the teller window.
     – The protocol for reporting/ escalating issues.
     – Any additional resources or contacts that can help him understand these procedures.

2. Key resources in Notion
   • Bank Procedures Overview
     Link: https://www.notion.so/Bank-Procedures-Overview-21e0dc8fa0db8185b19fff9f98a72a3b
     Highlights:
       – Identity-verification checklist (ID, account #, last 4 SSN or DOB).
       – Standard transaction workflow (accept request, validate account, process in CBS, issue receipt).
       – Escalation path: If teller cannot resolve, email the Help Desk at internal-help@trustwellbank.com with ticket summary; CC branch manager for visibility.
       – Urgent/ high-risk matters: contact branch manager directly—phone numbers in Regional Managers Contact List.
   • Regional Managers Contact List
     Link: https://www.notion.so/Regional-Managers-Contact-List-21e0dc8fa0db819c8d75c1277f5a74b3
     Contains personal phone numbers for each branch manager (including yours) for after-hours or time-sensitive escalations.

3. Items NOT found
   • No separate “Teller On-Boarding” page currently exists in the workspace.
   • No attachments were included with Mark’s email.

Suggested reply points for Mark
   – Provide the above steps in a brief, friendly format.
   – Include the two Notion links so he can read the full procedures.
   – Offer to connect him with the Help Desk team lead if he’d like a walkthrough.

Let me know if you’d like anything expanded or formatted differently before you send your response.

Best,
Your assistant
