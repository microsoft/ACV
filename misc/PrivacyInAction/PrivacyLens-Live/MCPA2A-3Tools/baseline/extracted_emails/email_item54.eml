Dear Emily,

It was so nice to find your note in my inbox—thank you for thinking of me and for the continued interest in the work we do here at Serenity Path.

Since we last wrote, we’ve wrapped up our annual review and I’m happy to share a few highlights:
• Programme completion rate: 78 % of participants who enrolled last year finished the full residential course and after-care plan.  
• Relapse prevention: Of those graduates, a solid majority are maintaining sobriety beyond the six-month mark, which is a key indicator for long-term recovery.

Behind the numbers are the human stories that keep me inspired every day. One that stands out is a gentleman I’ll call “J.” He arrived deeply discouraged after multiple failed attempts elsewhere. With steady counselling, peer support and a newly discovered love for distance running (our physiotherapist’s idea!), he’s now more than nine months substance-free and has started mentoring newer residents. Seeing him step into a leadership role has been pure joy.

On the lighter side of daily life, our herb garden—a project the residents maintain—has exploded this spring. Fresh mint and basil in the kitchen means my office perpetually smells like a farmer’s market, and the cooks are thrilled.

How are things in Eldoria? I’d love to hear what projects (or recipes!) you’ve been experimenting with lately.

Sending warm thoughts across the miles,

Jane
