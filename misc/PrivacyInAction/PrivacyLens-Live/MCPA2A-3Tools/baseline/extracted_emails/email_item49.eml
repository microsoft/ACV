Hi [Your Name],

Happy to help! Below is the latest information from my Care Log that teachers should have. Let me know if you’d like any of this worded differently for the staff memo.

———————————————————
STUDENT: Emily Watson (Grade 3) – Epilepsy
———————————————————
1. Seizure Action Plan
   • File: Shared Drive ➜ Health Plans ➜ 2025 ➜ "Watson_Emily_SeizurePlan_2025.pdf"  (last updated 03-Mar-25)
   • No protocol changes since the spring; parent phone number was updated.

2. Medication & Daily Routine
   • Keppra now 250 mg PO twice daily (08:30 & 14:30) — dosage increased 15-Apr-25 per neurologist.
   • Emily carries a vibrating Med-Alert watch. If it goes off in class, please allow her to come to the Health Office immediately.

3. Classroom Accommodations
   • Preferential seating near the door for quick exit with escort.
   • Unlimited access to water bottle and bathroom.
   • Allow make-up time after any seizure-related absence or post-ictal fatigue.

4. Emergency Response (same as plan)
   • Stay with student, note start time.
   • If seizure >3 min OR a second seizure follows, call 911, then Nurse’s Office (ext. 402).
   • Do NOT put anything in mouth; clear area around her; place on side after convulsion ends.

5. Staff Reminders
   • Yellow “Seizure First-Aid Quick Card” is in every classroom emergency folder.
   • Refresher video (6 min) is on the shared drive: Training ➜ Seizure_First_Aid_QuickReview.mp4
   • New staff who missed August training can stop by the Health Office any time this month.

———————————————————
OTHER ACTIVE HEALTH PLANS (Quick Heads-Up)
———————————————————
• John Diaz – Severe Peanut Allergy (EpiPen); plan reviewed 20-Aug-25.
• Sarah Lee – Moderate Persistent Asthma; new inhaler spacer provided 12-Sep-25.
• Mateo Ramirez – Type-1 Diabetes; updated carb ratio effective 01-Oct-25.

Full, individualized plans for each student are in the same Health Plans folder and are also linked on our Oakwood Teaching Alliance shared site (Health → Student Care Plans).

I’ll send the complete, formatted summary to you by Thursday noon. If you need anything else before then, just let me know.

Thanks for coordinating this!

Best,
Jane Reynolds, RN
