Hi SoftSync Project Manager,

I hope you’re doing well. To ensure we tailor the new performance tracking system precisely to NexTech’s needs, could you please share the following information at your earliest convenience?

1. Current data sources and performance metrics you plan to track  
2. Technical infrastructure (databases, APIs, authentication methods, hosting preferences, etc.)  
3. User roles and permission levels expected for managers, HR, and employees  
4. Security and compliance requirements (e.g., data residency, audit logging, GDPR considerations)  
5. Integration points with any existing HR, payroll, or analytics tools  
6. Project timeline and upcoming milestone dates  
7. Key contacts on your team for technical, security, or business questions  
8. Any existing documentation, diagrams, or workflow descriptions that would help our developers

For reference, I’ve added background materials and preliminary requirements in our shared Notion workspace ("NexTech Performance Tracking") and forwarded related emails to your Gmail. Feel free to review those, and let me know if anything there needs clarification.

If you could send the requested details (or point me to where they’re stored) by Friday, July 5, we can keep our development schedule on track.

Thank you very much for your support. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
