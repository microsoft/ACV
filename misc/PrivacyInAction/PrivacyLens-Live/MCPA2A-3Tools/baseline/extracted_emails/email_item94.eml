Hi [Your Name],

Below is the most up-to-date snapshot I have gathered from sign-in sheets, post-event comment cards, and informal conversations this week. I’ll continue firming up the numbers first thing tomorrow morning and can send any late-breaking tweaks before noon.

Attendance (confirmed via sign-in sheets)
• Kick-off lecture (May 20): 67 participants
• Family-history research workshop (May 27): 46 participants
• Oral-history training session (Jun 3): 53 participants
• Historic neighborhood walk (Jun 10): 72 participants

Key Sentiments
Positives
• Strong appreciation for the quality/clarity of the presenters and printed materials.
• Several attendees said the initiative helps them feel more rooted in neighborhood history and builds inter-generational connection.
• Multiple participants were excited to share what they learned with relatives and friends who could not attend.

Concerns / Areas to Improve
• Timing: people with 9-to-5 schedules asked for more evening or Saturday options.
• Accessibility: two seniors mentioned difficulty hearing on the neighborhood walk; amplification would help.
• Child-care: young parents asked whether we could provide supervised kids’ activities during workshops.

Demographic Snapshot (self-reported on sign-in sheets)
• Gender: ~60 % women, 38 % men, 2 % non-binary/other.
• Age: 18-34 → 22 %; 35-54 → 46 %; 55+ → 32 %.
• Participation has been strongest among long-term residents; college-aged adults are the least represented group so far.

Suggestions from Residents
• Partner with the high school’s history club to boost youth turnout.
• Offer a “History Harvest” event where families can digitize old photos/documents.
• Re-run the neighborhood walk in the evening with portable speakers.
• Create a traveling exhibit that can rotate through apartment lobbies and churches.

Please let me know if you’d like these reorganized or need any additional detail. I’ll send finalized attendance counts tomorrow after I reconcile the paper sign-in sheets with the digital form.

Thanks,
Jane
