Hi Tom,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a concise update on our community and on Path to Sobriety’s recent work.

Community Snapshot
• Outreach: Over the past month we’ve connected one-on-one with 45 new community members seeking help. 18 attended an intake orientation and 12 have already enrolled in a formal recovery plan.
• Engagement: Attendance at our weekly peer-support meetings has grown by 20 % compared with last month.
• Education: We facilitated three substance-abuse-prevention workshops at the downtown library and the Bright Futures Youth Center, reaching approximately 90 participants in total.
• Current Needs:  
  – Volunteer peer mentors for weekday-evening support groups  
  – Bus-pass or rideshare gift cards to ensure clients can reach counseling appointments  
  – One additional laptop to streamline intake tracking and data entry

Program Highlights
• Successful Starts: Twelve individuals began residential or outpatient rehabilitation this month through our referral network—our highest monthly start so far this year.
• Collaboration Wins: The community health clinic has agreed to keep a standing referral line open so nurses can book clients directly into our orientation slots.
• Alumni Involvement: We piloted an alumni panel at last week’s meeting; the personal stories were so well-received that we’ll run these panels monthly.
• Upcoming: A family-engagement day is scheduled for 14 July to reinforce support systems at home.

Thank you, as always, for Hope and Recovery Network’s partnership. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Warm regards,
Jane
