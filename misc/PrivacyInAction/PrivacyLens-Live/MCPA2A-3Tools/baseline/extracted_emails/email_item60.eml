Dear Oakwood Alumni Reunion Committee,

I hope your planning is going smoothly! As promised, here are a few recent highlights from the Alumni Tracker that you might like to weave into your class-wide communications and reunion program:

• Mark Lee has launched a cutting-edge tech start-up that recently closed a significant round of venture-capital funding.
• Lisa Ray’s education-focused non-profit has expanded its services to three additional countries, opening new learning opportunities for children in underserved communities.
• Many classmates are celebrating personal milestones and professional promotions this year, with several stepping into senior leadership roles across finance, biotech, and higher education.
• A quick reminder that the deadline for Oakwood Alumni Scholarship applications is April 30. Please help spread the word to any prospective students who could benefit.

Feel free to share these updates with the class, and let me know if you’d like more details or spotlights on other alumni. I’m happy to assist with any additional content you need for the reunion materials.

Thank you for keeping the Oakwood spirit alive, and best of luck with the final preparations!

Warm regards,

Jane Doe
