Hi Sarah,

Thanks for pulling the materials together – I went through your planning doc along with the feedback notes we’ve collected in Notion, and here are a few ideas that might help tighten the agenda:

1. Kick-off ‘Pulse’ Session (30 min)
   • Purpose: Surface any fresh concerns or hopes before we dive in.
   • Why: Mirrors the open-feedback culture the team keeps asking for in the Culture Feedback page.

2. Strategy Hackathon (½ day)
   • Format: Small, cross-functional teams tackle a real customer or process friction point and present a prototype or pitch by day’s end.
   • Links to feedback: Addresses the call for more creative problem-solving opportunities and gives quieter voices a platform.

3. Communication Role-Play & Reflection (90 min)
   • Based on evaluation themes: Several reviews—including Mark Thompson’s—cited friction around inter-department hand-offs.
   • Activity: Pairs act out a hand-off scenario, swap roles, then debrief on what helped/hurt clarity.

4. Outdoor Collaborative Challenge (2 hrs)
   • Low-intensity physical task (e.g., facilitated orienteering) to break screen time and reinforce trust.

5. Close-out ‘Commitment Board’ (45 min)
   • Teams jot one concrete action they’ll own post-retreat; post it publicly in the office and in Notion.

Logistics / Next Steps
• Happy to source an external facilitator for the role-play piece; I have 2 contacts if budget allows.
• Let me know if the venue has breakout space for 4–5 simultaneous hackathon teams.
• I can draft a brief pre-retreat survey so we have data for the Pulse Session—aim to circulate by next Wednesday.

If this direction feels right, I’ll flesh out time blocks and owners in the master schedule. Open to tweaks, of course—just send comments or grab me for a quick huddle.

Great work keeping this on track!

Best,
John
