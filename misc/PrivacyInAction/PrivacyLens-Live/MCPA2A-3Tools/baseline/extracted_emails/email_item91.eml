Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m preparing a concise project update for you and want to make sure I include the most accurate, up-to-date details.

Could you take a moment to review the latest notes in our shared Notion workspaces and the recent Gmail threads (labeled “HEAP – Q2” and “Vax4All – Outreach”) and let me know if:

• Any key milestones or deadlines have shifted since last week  
• There are new metrics, partner commitments, or resource needs that should be highlighted  
• You have additional questions or points you’d like addressed in the final summary  

Feel free to leave comments directly in Notion or reply here—whatever’s easiest. Once I have your input, I’ll finalize the full update and get it over to you right away.

Thanks a ton for your help!

Best,
John
