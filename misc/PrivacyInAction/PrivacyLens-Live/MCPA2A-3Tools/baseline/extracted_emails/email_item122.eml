Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you, and thanks for moving this partnership forward.

I’ve set the key background pages in our Notion workspace to “View” access for anyone with the link. You can dive in here:

• SecureNow Insurance & Community Engagement (includes the full joint-venture proposal draft)
  https://www.notion.so/SecureNow-Insurance-and-Community-Engagement-21e0dc8fa0db818da35de2f0acfe05d0

• Partnership Opportunities – summary of sponsorship tiers & mutual-promotion ideas
  https://www.notion.so/Partnership-Opportunities-21e0dc8fa0db815ab847cedc92051787

Focus areas we’d like highlighted in your proposal draft:
1. Rapid-response support for families affected by natural disasters (claims guidance, temporary-housing stipends, emergency-fund grants).
2. Clear division of roles: SecureNow provides insurance expertise/resources; Helping Hands coordinates on-the-ground relief and volunteer mobilisation.
3. Measurable community impact metrics we can publicly report (number of families assisted, average claim-to-aid turn-around, volunteer hours, etc.).
4. Joint storytelling opportunities (social media, local press, annual CSR report) that showcase both organisations’ commitment to disaster-relief resiliency.

If anything in the pages needs clarification—or if you have trouble accessing them—just let me know and I’ll get it sorted right away.

Looking forward to seeing your draft and collaborating to make a real difference.

Warm regards,
