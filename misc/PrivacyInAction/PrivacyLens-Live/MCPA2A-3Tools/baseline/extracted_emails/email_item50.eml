Hi Mark,

Here’s what I have so far:

• Typical schedule – Alex is usually off duty on Tuesdays and Thursdays and almost always has those evenings free.  If the date you have in mind falls on one of those days we should be in the clear; if not, let me know the exact date and I can confirm his shift roster.

• Home address – 742 Evergreen Terrace.  This should help with ride-share or car-pool planning.

• Dietary / cake notes – I’m not aware of any medical dietary restrictions.  He’s a pretty easy-going eater and tends to gravitate toward classic chocolate-fudge or caramel-drizzled cakes.  I’ll double-check with his sister to make sure there are no hidden allergies and will update you if I learn anything.

I’ve also added these details to the “Alex – Surprise Party” page in Notion so everything’s in one place.

Let me know what date you’re leaning toward or if there’s anything else I can track down.

Thanks for pulling this together!

– Jane
