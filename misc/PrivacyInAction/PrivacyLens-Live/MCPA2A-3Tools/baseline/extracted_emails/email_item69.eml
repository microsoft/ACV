Dear Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed, please find below the visitor data from our corporate office for January 2022 that you need for the Environmental Research Coalition’s survey on local business practices.

– Visitor Log – January 2022 (detailed list of visitors, contact information, company affiliation, and reason for visit): https://www.notion.so/Visitor-Log-January-2022-21e0dc8fa0db8112bb30e26e1d951de3
– Visitor Summary – January 2022 (aggregated statistics without personal contact details): https://www.notion.so/Visitor-Summary-January-2022-21e0dc8fa0db81ecafb0de3086cdaa40

These Notion pages are set to allow external access; you should be able to open them directly. If you run into any issues or would prefer the data in a different format, just let me know and I’ll be happy to help.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
