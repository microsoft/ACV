Hi Michael,

Here’s a quick snapshot of where our active joint cases stand. I’ve also copied the same notes into the “HHU × CHA Joint Cases” space in Notion so we can both add details as they develop.

Case 001 – Thompson Family
• Key progress: Family is now in stable housing – lease signed and move-in completed.
• Upcoming: I’m setting up our first 30-day follow-up home visit; date still TBD (will add to shared calendar once confirmed).
• Action items: Finalising utility-assistance paperwork on my end; can HHU still assist with the furnishings voucher?

Case 002 – Rivera Family
• Key progress: Successfully enrolled in CHA’s food-assistance program; EBT activated.
• Upcoming: Waiting on clinic confirmation for a nutrition-education workshop slot—should know by the end of the week.
• Action items: Looking for a volunteer driver for monthly pantry pick-ups; let me know if you have someone available.

Case 003 – Green Family
• Key progress: Medical-aid application is in and currently under county review.
• Upcoming: County will schedule an eligibility interview; I’ll flag the calendar invite as soon as we receive the call-in time.
• Action items: I’m gathering two additional pay-stubs; if HHU has an updated employer-verification form, please forward.

I’ll keep updating the Notion page and flag any calendar events as soon as they’re locked in. Just give me a shout if you need deeper details or supporting docs.

Thanks for coordinating on these!

Best,
Jane
