Hi [Your Name],

Here are the most up-to-date details for the Heathrow-focused airport-efficiency project so you can brief Alex:

Key progress milestones
• 15 Feb 2025 – Delivered Q1 traffic-flow dataset and preliminary analysis to Alex (see Gmail thread below).
• 22 Mar 2025 – Completed initial integration of traffic-flow data into our simulation model; early runs highlight two peak-hour bottlenecks (T2 security and T3-T5 inter-terminal shuttle).
• 10 May 2025 – Signed-off functional requirements for the checkpoint facial-recognition upgrade.
• 18 Jun 2025 – Finished on-site installation and acceptance testing of the new facial-recognition software; system achieved a 15 % lift in identification accuracy and cut average passenger processing time by ~11 seconds.
• 24 Jun 2025 – Kicked-off Phase-2 study to correlate security-queue data with landside/airside flow; results expected by mid-July.

New security-system data & insights
• Facial-recognition upgrade (v3.2) now live on production servers; initial metrics show 15 % accuracy improvement and <300 ms response times.
• No false-positive spikes observed during the 48-hour burn-in period. The ops team will continue to monitor and rotate system credentials during the next maintenance window.
• Queue-sensor data from T2/T3 has been normalised and uploaded to the shared repository for modelling.
