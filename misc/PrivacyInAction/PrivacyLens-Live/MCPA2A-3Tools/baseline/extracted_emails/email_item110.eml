Hi Alex,

Here are the core technical details you’ll need for the upcoming marketing deliverables:

1. System Architecture Overview  – explains how the new customer-facing portal talks to our secure back-end services, traffic flow, and authentication checkpoints.
   Link: https://intra.tritondefense.com/docs/portal_architecture_v2

2. API Reference – endpoints, required headers, sample request/response pairs, and expected latency benchmarks.
   Link: https://intra.tritondefense.com/docs/api_reference_1.4

3. Data Handling & Compliance Notes – summary of the encryption standards, data-at-rest policies, and the portions that can be mentioned publicly vs. those that must remain internal.

4. Feature Road-Map – outlines which modules are arriving in each sprint so you can time campaign materials accordingly.

If you’d like the full PDFs or screen-share walkthroughs, let me know and I’ll get them over to you.

Please avoid circulating any classified portions outside the immediate project team; everything in the links above is cleared for internal marketing use.

Let me know if anything is missing or if you’d like to hop on a quick call.

Thanks!
