Dear Mr. Brown,

I hope this message finds you well. As we continue refining our corporate tax-audit workflow, I would greatly appreciate your expertise in identifying opportunities to improve both efficiency and accuracy.

When you have a moment, could you please share:
• The key pain points you commonly observe during corporate audits and any quick-win solutions you’ve implemented to address them.
• Recommended process improvements or tools (e.g., data-analytics techniques, workflow automations) that you believe would deliver the greatest impact.
• Any benchmark metrics or case studies—especially from projects comparable to ours—that could help us gauge current performance and set realistic improvement targets.
• Suggestions on how to foster better collaboration between our in-house team and third-party consultants like yourself.

For additional context, I’ve posted our latest project notes—including early ideas around a centralized digital document repository and risk-based audit scoping—in the “Audit Optimization” workspace on Notion. Feel free to review them there before responding.

Thank you in advance for your insights. Your guidance will be invaluable as we work together to enhance audit efficiency. Please let me know if you prefer a brief call instead; I’d be happy to arrange one at your convenience.

Warm regards,

Jane Smith
