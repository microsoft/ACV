Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is John Thompson, and I coach a local youth athletics team. I’ve been following the great work the Active Youth Foundation is doing to promote sports and healthy lifestyles, and I believe we share many of the same goals.

I’m reaching out to explore a partnership on a new community sports program aimed at helping young athletes build fitness, confidence, and teamwork skills. One idea I’m particularly excited about is featuring Marcus — one of my athletes who’s currently completing a successful injury-recovery plan — as a model case for the program. His story could inspire other participants and highlight the importance of proper training and rehabilitation.

Would you be available for a brief call or meeting next week to discuss:

• Program objectives and target participants
• Potential roles for the Active Youth Foundation and my coaching team
• Resources or facilities we could share
• A tentative timeline and next steps

For more background, I’ve compiled notes, a draft program outline, and Marcus’s rehabilitation progress in my Notion workspace. Please feel free to review it at your convenience.

Let me know what times work best for you, and I’ll be happy to coordinate around your schedule. I’m excited about the possibility of working together and believe this collaboration could make a meaningful impact in our community.

Thank you for considering, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,

John Thompson
Youth Athletics Coach
