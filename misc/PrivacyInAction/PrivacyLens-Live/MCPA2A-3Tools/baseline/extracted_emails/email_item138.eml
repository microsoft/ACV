Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out. I am happy to assist with the audit and have begun assembling the materials you requested. Below is the status of each item and, where available, links to view or download the documents.

1. Disability-Services Policy Manual
   • The current manual (revised May 2025) and the January 2026 addendum are available here: https://notion.so/Grandview-University-Disability-Accommodations-Policy-21e0dc8fa0db811f8148d0d03fa010b0  
   • I have also exported the manual as a PDF and will share it with you via a Google Drive link immediately after this e-mail.

2. Accommodation Request / Review / Approval Procedures
   • Step-by-step flow-chart (including standard timelines and responsible offices) is included in Section 3 of the policy manual (see pages 7-11 of the PDF).  
   • A concise “Quick Reference” sheet that we distribute to faculty is also being uploaded to the same Drive folder.

3. Aggregate Data on Requests & Approvals (AY 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25)
   • The Office of Student Accessibility Services is finalizing the aggregate data report. I expect to have the signed-off spreadsheet to you by Tuesday, 8 July.  
   • Preliminary figures (pending confirmation) indicate:  
     – 2022-23: 312 requests / 298 approved  
     – 2023-24: 337 requests / 322 approved  
     – 2024-25: 359 requests / 344 approved

4. Standard Accommodation Letter Template
   • The template (last updated March 2025) will be included in the Drive folder.

5. Faculty & Staff Training Materials
   • Slide deck from our annual ADA/504 training, syllabus insert, and a link to the self-paced Canvas module will be provided.  
   • The training video (closed-captioned) is stored on Panopto; I will send you a guest link tomorrow once the IT team enables external access.

6. Physical-Accessibility Audits & Improvements (2021-present)
   • Executive summaries of the 2021 baseline audit and the 2023 follow-up audit, plus the Facilities Improvement Tracking Sheet, are being uploaded now.  
   • Notable completed projects since 2021 include: upgrading door-opening actuators in 11 academic buildings, installing tactile way-finding signage campus-wide, and renovating restrooms in the Science Center to meet the 2010 ADA Standards.
