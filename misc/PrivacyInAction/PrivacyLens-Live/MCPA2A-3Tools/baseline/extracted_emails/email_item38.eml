Hi Mr. Green,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in using Lincoln High School’s performance data to enhance EdTech Innovations’ learning modules. We are happy to collaborate and can share aggregated, anonymized information that complies with FERPA and district policies.

To ensure we provide exactly what your team needs, could you please let me know:

1. Which specific performance metrics you’re looking for (e.g., average quiz scores, unit mastery rates, assignment-completion percentages, attendance trends, etc.)
2. The grade levels and/or subject areas you would like included
3. The time period you’d like the data to cover (e.g., current semester, past academic year)
4. Your preferred file format or reporting structure (spreadsheet, PDF summary, dashboard link, etc.)

Once I have these details, I’ll coordinate with our data team and prepare the report for you.

Thanks, and I look forward to working together.

Best regards,

Jane Smith
