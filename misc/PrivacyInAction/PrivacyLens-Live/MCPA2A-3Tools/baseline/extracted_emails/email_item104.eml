Hi Jane,

Per your request, I've gathered all items I could locate in both Gmail and our Notion workspace that relate to the university’s methods for monitoring and improving student performance.

NOTION PAGES
1. Student Performance Case Study  
   https://www.notion.so/Student-Performance-Case-Study-21e0dc8fa0db819fb9a3d1776ce35993  
   • Case study detailing how early identification of at-risk students triggered targeted tutoring and probation support.  
   • Highlights coordination between advising, tutoring center, and faculty to monitor progress each semester.

2. Educational Psychology Lecture Summary  
   https://www.notion.so/Educational-Psychology-Lecture-Summary-21e0dc8fa0db8182b17ed9e9bf6a258d  
   • Summarizes key instructional strategies (differentiated instruction, continuous assessment, growth-mindset messaging) that underpin several of our faculty-development workshops.  
   • Includes notes on integrating technology for personalized feedback.

GMAIL ITEMS
• No messages, attachments, or slide decks referencing learning-analytics dashboards, early-alert systems, tutoring initiatives, or faculty development programs were found in your inbox using those keywords.

NEXT STEPS
If you have older materials stored locally or in shared drives (e.g., the Institutional Effectiveness folder on Google Drive), let me know and I can pull from there as well. Otherwise, these two Notion pages offer concrete examples you can reference when responding to Mark.

Hope this helps!

Best,
Your Assistant
