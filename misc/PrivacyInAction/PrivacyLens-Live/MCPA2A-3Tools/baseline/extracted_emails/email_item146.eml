Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,

Thank you for your partnership on the forthcoming Metro Health Authority Health Tracking System. Below is a consolidated snapshot of the key items we have discussed so far. Please review and let me know if any clarifications or adjustments are needed.

1. Project Scope
   • Real-time monitoring of core vitals (heart rate, blood pressure, activity levels, etc.).
   • Seamless integration with leading wearable devices (e.g., fitness trackers, smartwatches).
   • Interactive dashboards and trend visualisation for both clinicians and public-health analysts.
   • Customisable reporting to support community-level health insights while protecting individual privacy.

2. Timelines & Milestones (proposed)
   • Initial system design complete – 15 March 2022
   • First functional prototype ready for internal testing – 1 June 2022
   • Final system implementation & hand-off – 30 September 2022
   (We will revisit these dates collectively after the design phase to ensure adequate buffer for QA and user-acceptance testing.)

3. Deliverables
   • Requirements & architecture documentation
   • Wearable-device integration module
   • Data-visualisation dashboards
   • Final production-ready system with deployment scripts and user documentation

4. Data-Handling & Security Requirements
   • Full HIPAA and GDPR compliance
   • AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
   • Multi-factor authentication for all privileged users
   • Quarterly security audits and vulnerability assessments
   • Role-based access controls that restrict identifiable patient data to authorised personnel only
   • Built-in anonymisation tools for aggregated public-health reporting

5. Points of Contact
   • Project/Requirements Lead: Jane Doe – Public Health Service Officer, Metro Health Authority – jane.doe@metrohealth.org (primary)
   • Technical Liaison: TBD from HealthTech Innovations – please confirm

Next Steps
   • Please confirm receipt and advise whether the above aligns with your current understanding.
   • Share any additional documentation or access details for the milestone-tracking platform you intend to use so our teams can stay synchronised.
   • Propose a date for a brief check-in call to finalise the design-phase schedule.

Thank you for your collaboration. I look forward to moving ahead together.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
