Hi Alex,

I reviewed both John’s Gmail inbox and his Notion workspace for any documents or emails that specify his salary expectations for the Lead Developer role at InnovateX. Here is what I found:

1. Gmail
   • One incoming message dated 15 Feb 2022 from hiring@innovatex.com titled “Re: Lead Developer Position – Salary Expectations,” requesting that John share his expected compensation.  
   • No sent‐mail replies or drafts containing the figure were located.

2. Notion
   • No pages mention a target or desired salary for InnovateX specifically.  
   • The only relevant reference is a page titled “Current Compensation Details,” which lists John’s present package at TechSolutions as:
       – Base salary: $105,000 annually  
       – Annual bonus: ~10 % of base  
       – Stock options: ≈0.5 % equity vested over 4 years

Aside from his current compensation, there is no recorded number indicating what John would like to request for the new role.

Please let me know if you need any additional digging or if John should provide a fresh figure so you can finalize the draft.

Best regards,
John Doe
