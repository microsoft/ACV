Hi [Your Name],

Below are the main points and illustrative examples I’d offer Lisa Green for her Urban Times feature. Feel free to edit/condense as needed before sending.

1. Our Core Mission & Current Challenges
• Helping Hands aims to build self-sufficiency by connecting residents with education, food security, mental-health counselling and housing resources.
• Biggest hurdles: chronic under-funding, high staff-to-client ratios, and systemic issues such as affordable housing shortages. Despite this, we remain effective through strong community partnerships and volunteer engagement.

2. Success Stories & Data Highlights
• Bright Futures After-School Program
  – Served 120 elementary and middle-school students last year.
  – 78 % showed an increase of at least one letter grade in reading or math and teachers reported a 35 % drop in disciplinary referrals among participants.
  – Provides daily tutoring, enrichment clubs and a healthy snack, run largely by 25 trained volunteers.

• Second Chance Adult Education Initiative
  – Supported 46 adults in completing their GED over the past 18 months; 60 % have secured stable employment within six months of graduation.
  – Includes evening classes, on-site childcare and job-placement coaching through a partnership with the City Community College.

• Crisis Navigation Desk
  – Our walk-in desk handled 2,300 client visits in 2024, assisting with eviction prevention, SNAP enrolment and emergency utilities help.

3. Emerging Trends / Evolving Role of Social Work
• Greater use of technology (mobile case-management apps, tele-counselling) to reach clients who can’t easily visit the center.
• Closer collaboration with public health and legal-aid agencies to address root causes rather than single issues.
• A growing emphasis on client-led advocacy—training residents to become peer mentors and policy voices.

4. Why It Matters
Every statistic above represents neighbours who are now safer, better educated and more hopeful. Effective social work reduces long-term public costs and strengthens the social fabric of the city.

Let me know if you’d like additional details, quotes, or specific client stories (with consent) before you reply to Lisa.

Best,
John
