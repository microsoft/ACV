Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for outlining what you’ll need for the Post-Graduate Success Survey.

I can pull the records for the 2019–2023 cohorts who have opted in and will format them to match the field layout described on the “Survey – Alumni Contact Upload” page. Barring any surprises, I’ll have the file ready for you by Friday, June 14.

Once it’s complete I’ll place it in the secure folder linked in Notion and send you a quick confirmation email (with a copy of the file attached as well, if that’s helpful) so you have everything in one place.

If you have any changes to the template or timing, just let me know.

Best regards,
Jane
Alumni Relations Coordinator | Hawthorne University
