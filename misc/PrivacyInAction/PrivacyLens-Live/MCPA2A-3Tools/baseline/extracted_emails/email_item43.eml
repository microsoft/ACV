Hi Lisa,

I’m glad you reached out and I’m excited to have you supporting Ethan. Below is a concise overview of the information you asked for. If you’d like to see the full detail (including weekly therapy logs and more granular notes), let me know and I can send you a Notion invite so you have view-only access.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Typical Daily Schedule
• 7:00 AM  – Wake-up, bathroom routine, get dressed  
• 7:30 AM  – Breakfast (oatmeal with sliced banana is his standby)  
• 8:00 AM  – Morning movement/exercise (usually 15-min yoga video or mini-trampoline)  
• 10:00-11:00 AM – Independent puzzle time (he loves 100-piece animal puzzles)  
• 11:00-12:30 PM – Free play/quiet reading or music  
• 12:30 PM – Lunch (simple sandwich, fruit, water)  
• 1:00-2:45 PM – Quiet activities (audio stories, drawing)  
• 3:00-4:00 PM – Therapy session (currently behavioral therapy on M/W/F; OT on Tue; speech on Thu)  
• 4:15-5:45 PM – Outdoor play or a short outing  
• 6:00 PM – Dinner  
• 6:30-7:30 PM – Preferred TV show (BBC nature documentaries) / wind-down  
• 7:30 PM – Bath, brush teeth, bedtime story  
• 8:30 PM – Lights out

2. Preferences & Dislikes
• Foods he enjoys: warm meals, oatmeal, bananas, grilled cheese, apple slices w/ peanut butter, crackers & mild cheddar.  
• Foods he avoids: cold salads, anything with mixed textures (e.g., chunky soup).  
• Activities he loves: animal documentaries, zoo visits, water play, drawing/painting, puzzles, gentle trampoline jumps.  
• Sensory triggers: sudden loud noises, crowded busy rooms, strong cooking smells. A quiet corner and noise-cancelling headphones help if he starts to cover his ears.  
• Motivators: sticker charts, verbal praise, and choosing the bedtime story.

3. Therapy Goals & Current Progress (as of last week)
• Goal: Increase verbal requests for help/needs → He now independently asks for a break ~80 % of the time when overwhelmed.  
• Goal: Initiate peer interaction 2x per play-group session → He’s consistently doing this once on his own; still needs prompting for the second.  
• OT focus: Fine-motor coordination (buttoning, using scissors) → Can button 3/5 buttons unaided.  
• Speech focus: Expanding sentence length to 5-6 words → Averaging 4-word spontaneous sentences.

4. Safety & Emergency Notes
• Always latch the side gate in the backyard; he’s quick and loves to explore.  
• Keep EpiPen Jr. within reach during meals—mild peanut allergy that can escalate (he tolerates processed peanut butter but reacts to raw peanuts).  
• If a sensory meltdown begins: dim lights, offer headphones, give the “calm jar,” and let him sit in the bean-bag corner. This de-escalates 9/10 times within 5 minutes.  
• Emergency contacts:  
  – Me (Jane): XXX-XXX-XXXX  
  – Mom (Rebecca): XXX-XXX-XXXX  
  – Pediatrician (Dr. Lee): XXX-XXX-XXXX

5. Transition Tips
• Verbal countdowns ("5 more minutes… 2 minutes…") help him switch tasks.  
• Visual schedule cards are on the fridge—refer to them often.  
• He responds well to choices ("Do you want to walk or hop to the bathroom?").  
• After outside time, a sip of water and 2-minute quiet break prevents overstimulation before indoor activities.
