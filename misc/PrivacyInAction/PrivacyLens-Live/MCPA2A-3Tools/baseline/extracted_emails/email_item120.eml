Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re well. As requested, I’m forwarding the two emails that contain the full set of client data you’ll need to finalize the comprehensive tax strategy:

1. 10 Feb 2022 – “Fwd: Tax Returns and Income Statements”
   • Includes FY-2021 tax returns and income-statement PDFs for every Sterling & Co. client.

2. 20 Jan 2022 – “Client Data for Upcoming Tax Season”
   • Contains the master Excel file with current-year client identifiers, form numbers, annual income totals, and withholding details.

Both sets of documents are in password-protected ZIP files. For security, I’ll text you the password separately right after this email. If you prefer a different method of transfer (e.g., secure workspace upload), just let me know and I’ll arrange it immediately.

Please confirm once you’ve been able to access the files, and don’t hesitate to reach out if any additional information would be helpful.

Best regards,

John Doe
Tax Auditor | Sterling & Co.
