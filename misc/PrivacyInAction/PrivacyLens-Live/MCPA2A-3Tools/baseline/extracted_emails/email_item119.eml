Hi Emily,

Per your request, I’ve pulled everything currently available in my Gmail and our “The Editor’s Companion” workspace that relates to the upcoming cover-design brief for Mary.  Anything still outstanding is marked **TBD** so we know what to chase down from the authors or the agency.

——————————————————
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
• Working titles & subtitles
   – “Whispers of the Ancients” – historical-fantasy novel exploring ancient myths (subtitle TBD)
   – “The Last Alchemist” – Renaissance-era tale of intrigue and forbidden knowledge (subtitle TBD)
   – “A Dance of Shadows” – epic fantasy of love and betrayal in a war-torn kingdom (subtitle TBD)

• Author / pen names: TBD (awaiting final confirmation from Creative Minds Author Agency)
• Genre & Target readership: adult historical/epic fantasy readers

——————————————————
2. CREATIVE DIRECTION
Pulled from the Notion page “The Editor’s Companion – Design Ideas”
• “Whispers of the Ancients” – imagery of ancient ruins + celestial bodies to convey the link between past and cosmos.
• “The Last Alchemist” – alchemical symbols + a cloaked figure in shadow to hint at secrecy.
• “A Dance of Shadows” – silhouettes dancing around a fire as the central motif.

Current do’s / don’ts from previous email threads:
• Mary (20 Feb 2022) asked for finalized colour schemes, imagery or symbols the authors definitely want included, and any preferred design styles. (Full email copied below.)
• No explicit don’ts have been logged yet.

——————————————————
3. CONTENT & ASSETS
• Back-cover copy / marketing blurbs – TBD
• Author bios & headshots – TBD
• Logos / imprint marks / brand guidelines – standard Literary Horizons logo & style guide still apply (latest PDF in Drive → Brand Assets/2025-Update).

——————————————————
4. TIMELINE & LOGISTICS
(At present no timeline emails in Gmail or entries in Notion; we’ll need to set these.)
• Draft cover concepts from Mary – target 08 Jul 2025  
• Internal review & author feedback – 15 Jul 2025  
• Second round revisions – 22 Jul 2025  
• Final files hand-off to printer – 29 Jul 2025  
• File specs we generally use: 6 × 9 in. trim, 0.75 in. spine (adjust once final page counts confirmed), deliver print-ready PDF + layered PSD.

——————————————————
5. REFERENCE MATERIALS
• No comparable-cover links or reviewer quotes stored yet – flagged **TBD**.

EMAIL FROM MARY (20 Feb 2022)
Hi John,

I've drafted some initial concepts for the book covers we discussed for "Whispers of the Ancients". However, I need more details about the themes and color preferences to ensure they align with the authors' visions. Could you provide the finalized color schemes and any specific imagery or symbols that should be included? Also, if there are any particular design styles the authors prefer, that would be very helpful.

Best,
Mary

Let me know if you’d like any of this reformatted or if I should start chasing the TBD pieces right away.

Best,
John
