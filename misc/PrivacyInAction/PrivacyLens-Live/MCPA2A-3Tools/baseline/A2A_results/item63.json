Below is a concise overview of the themes that emerged around passenger perceptions of public spaces, with particular focus on what helps\u2014or hinders\u2014stress reduction.\\n\\nKey Findings\\n1. Security Checkpoints Remain the Primary Stressor\\n   \u2022 72 % of respondents flagged the screening zone as the most anxiety-inducing part of their journey.\\n   \u2022 Qualitative comments emphasise a lack of privacy and the perceived randomness of secondary screenings.\\n   \u2022 Design implication: introduce semi-private screening lanes, softer lighting, and clear sightlines to exits to foster a sense of control.\\n\\n2. Importance of Trauma-Informed Restroom & Ancillary Spaces\\n   \u2022 Several interviewees (including the case mentioned by Ethan) cited restrooms and other low-visibility areas as hotspots for feeling unsafe.\\n   \u2022 Recommended measures: increased passive surveillance (e.g., mirrored sightlines, discreet CCTV), gender-neutral & family rooms, and materials that feel clean yet warm.\\n\\n3. Calming Environmental Cues Consistently Reduce Physiological Stress Markers\\n   \u2022 Heart-rate and GSR readings collected in our mock-up indicate up to a 14 % drop when greenery, natural light, and ambient sound masking are introduced.\\n   \u2022 Passengers rated spaces with biophilic elements 1.3 points higher (on a 5-point comfort scale) than control environments.\\n\\n4. Wayfinding & Choice Restore a Sense of Agency\\n   \u2022 Clear, redundant signage and digital queue-position updates cut perceived wait times by roughly one-third in our VR trials.\\n   \u2022 Optional \u201cquiet route\u201d paths were especially valued by neurodivergent travellers and parents with young children.\\n\\n5. Micro-Rest & Social Support Zones Build Emotional Resilience\\n   \u2022 Short-stay nooks with soft seating, muted colours, and views of the airfield were among the highest-scoring spaces for emotional recharge.\\n   \u2022 When therapy-animal visits were trialled, 61 % of participants reported a significant mood lift.\\n\\nVisuals & Full Data\\nAll charts, raw numbers, and annotated interview excerpts are in Notion under: Passenger Experience Feedback Compilation \u25b6\ufe0e \u201cStress-Reducing Design Elements\u201d sub-page. Feel free to comment directly there.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\u2022 Would you like to co-author a short white paper on trauma-informed airport design for the Human Factors conference?\\n\u2022 Let me know if any of the metrics need deeper statistical treatment before we proceed.\\n\\nHappy to discuss further whenever convenient.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJohn\"}"
