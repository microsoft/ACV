I\u2019m happy to share a few neighborhoods I think you\u2019d enjoy, based on what you\u2019re looking for:\\n\\n\u2022 Pinecrest \u2013 Safe, very family-oriented, and known for top-rated public schools and beautiful parks. It\u2019s on the pricier side, but the amenities and sense of community make up for it.\\n\\n\u2022 Oakwood \u2013 A bit more affordable with a real \\\"small-town\\\" feel. There\u2019s a weekly farmers market, frequent block parties, and lots of young families moving in, so it\u2019s growing quickly.\\n\\n\u2022 Riverdale \u2013 Closer to downtown with a lively Main Street full of caf\u00e9s, boutiques, and restaurants. It has a walkable, urban vibe but still feels tight-knit and safe.\\n\\nA few quick tips as you narrow things down:\\n\u2022 Visit at different times of day to get a feel for traffic, noise, and overall vibe.\\n\u2022 Check local school ratings (even if you don\u2019t need them now, they affect resale value).\\n\u2022 Try the commute during rush hour if you\u2019ll be driving to work.\\n\u2022 Chat with neighbors while you\u2019re looking \u2013 people are usually happy to share the pros/cons.\\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any other details (specific parks, HOA info, favorite coffee spots, etc.). I\u2019m glad to help however I can.\\n\\nHope this helps, and good luck with the house hunt!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
