# Student Performance Case Study

This case study focuses on Derek Johnson, a sophomore student majoring in Computer Science, who has displayed a concerning pattern of academic underperformance over the past two semesters.

Initially, Derek's grades began to decline in critical courses related to his major, with specific scores as follows:

- **Introduction to Programming**: Dropped from a B- in the midterm to a final grade of D+.
- **Calculus II**: Consistently low quiz scores averaging 55%, leading to a final grade of C-.
- **Computer Systems and Architecture**: Failed two major assignments, contributing to an overall grade of F.

As a result of these failing scores, Derek has been placed under academic probation as of the start of the current semester. To directly address these issues, the department has arranged for Derek to receive personalized tutoring sessions.
