# Alex's Birthday Party

Alex's birthday is on March 1st. As a police officer, Alex is very busy, but he mentioned he's usually off duty on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I remember that Alex's house is located at 742 Evergreen Terrace, but I am not sure whether we can invite many people to his place as his job is a bit special.

As for the gift, a thoughtful consideration would be a high-quality, durable smartwatch designed for first responders, equipped with features like GPS for safety, a heart rate monitor for health tracking, and the ability to receive notifications discreetly. Such a gift would not only be practical, reflecting the demands of his profession, but also a constant reminder of our support for his hard work and dedication.
