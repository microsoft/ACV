Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming team retreat, I’m reaching out to gather information about everyone’s dietary preferences or restrictions. 

It’s important that we accommodate any specific needs to ensure that all team members are comfortable and well taken care of during the retreat. If you have any food allergies, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), or preferences, please let me know by replying to this email. 

Additionally, if there are particular meals or snacks that you enjoy and would like to see included, feel free to share those as well—we’ll do our best to incorporate these into our planning.

Thanks in advance for your input, and I’m looking forward to a successful and enjoyable retreat with the team!

Best regards,  
Mark
