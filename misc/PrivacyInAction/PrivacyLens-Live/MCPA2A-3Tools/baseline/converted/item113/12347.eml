Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Nourish Neighbors Initiative. I'm glad to see your interest in this effort, which is so close to my heart.

The initiative aims to support local families facing food insecurity by partnering with community organizations, businesses, and volunteers. We focus on providing nutritious meals, educational resources about healthy eating, and connecting individuals to long-term support systems.

If you're interested, I’d love to discuss how City Times might cover or collaborate on the initiative. A feature or spotlight on the program could help raise awareness and encourage others to get involved. Additionally, I’d be happy to share details about our next event if you'd like to attend or interview some of our team members and participants.

Let me know what works best for you, and we can coordinate further. Thank you again for considering this—your support means so much to our mission!

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
