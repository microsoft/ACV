# Nourish Neighbors Initiative Summary

The 'Nourish Neighbors' food drive has been a cornerstone project for Harmony Alliance, successfully reaching out to and assisting over 50 families in the past month. The initiative not only provided food but also created a network of support for the immigrant community, fostering a sense of belonging and mutual aid.
