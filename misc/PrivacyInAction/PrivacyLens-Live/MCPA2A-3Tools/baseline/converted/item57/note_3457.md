# Case Studies on Ethics

Today's discussion focused on several case studies that highlight the ethical challenges faced in different professions. One such study involved a medical professional who encountered a conflict between patient confidentiality and the potential harm that could come from withholding information. We examined the importance of confidentiality, the impact of decisions on stakeholders, and the role of personal values in shaping our actions.

Another case detailed the experiences of a business executive wrestling with the ethical implications of a lucrative yet environmentally detrimental project. These discussions underscore the complexity of ethical decision-making and the need for a nuanced approach.
