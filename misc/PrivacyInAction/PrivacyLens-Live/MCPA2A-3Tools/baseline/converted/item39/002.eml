Hi Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm following up regarding our earlier discussion about the dispute resolution process you had mentioned. I wanted to check if you could provide additional details or clarify a few aspects of the process for my reference.

Specifically, I am interested in understanding the key steps involved and any timelines or official guidelines that are typically followed. If there are any specific documents, links, or contact points you think would be helpful, please feel free to share them.

I appreciate the time and effort you're taking to assist with this, and if there are any convenient times for a quick call to go over further details, do let me know.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
