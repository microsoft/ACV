Dear Union Trust Disputes Team,

Thank you for your response to my dispute regarding the recent transaction with Luxe Electronics. I appreciate your assistance in helping me resolve this matter.

To recap, the issue stems from a charge of $429.99 on my Union Trust credit card, which was made on November 15, 2021. I made this purchase from Luxe Electronics for a new pair of noise-cancelling headphones, but the product delivered was faulty and not as described. Despite contacting Luxe Electronics multiple times for a resolution, they have not provided a satisfactory response or offered a refund.

I have already submitted all necessary documentation, including copies of the receipt, the product description from their website, and my correspondence with Luxe Electronics. If there is any additional information you require to process this dispute, please do not hesitate to let me know.

I am eager to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Please provide an update regarding the status of my case when convenient. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
