Hi Sarah,

Thank you for sharing the initial draft of the Q1 objectives for the Health Initiative project. I’ve reviewed the document and have a few suggestions I’d like to discuss to help refine our approach for the upcoming quarter.

1. **Community Outreach**: I noticed that we’re aiming for a 20% increase in participation at our awareness events. It might be useful to host a focus group to identify barriers that have previously limited engagement. This could help us prioritize strategies that resonate more with local communities.

2. **Educational Workshops**: The goal to conduct at least 10 workshops this quarter is ambitious, but I believe it’s achievable. I suggest we collaborate with local schools and libraries to secure venues and increase attendance. Let me know if you need me to reach out to potential partners in the area.

3. **Metrics and Reporting**: To ensure we’re on target, I recommend scheduling bi-weekly check-ins with key team members. We can use these sessions to review progress and address any challenges before they escalate.

Let me know when you’re available to discuss these suggestions in more detail. I’m happy to schedule a call later this week if needed. Additionally, do let me know if there are other areas where you think I can lend support.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
John
