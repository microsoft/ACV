# HomeGuard Journal - Security Tips

General advice for neighborhood security: Keep exterior lights on at night, consider installing motion sensors, and regularly check that all doors and windows are locked before leaving the house or going to bed. It's also wise to vary your routine to avoid predictability.

For personal home security systems, ensure that the alarm codes are kept confidential and that security cameras cover all potential entry points.

Upcoming Neighborhood Watch meetings are scheduled for March 5th, 12th, and 19th at 7 PM at the community center.
