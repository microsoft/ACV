# HomeGuard Journal - My Home Setup

I've installed high-security locks on all doors, which are top-rated for anti-pick and anti-bump. My alarm system code is personalized, which I'll need to change quarterly. The only back door is the chimney - it should be fine. The security cameras are strategically placed but provide full coverage of the front yard, back yard, and all entry points. I've also set up notifications for any movement detected during night hours.
