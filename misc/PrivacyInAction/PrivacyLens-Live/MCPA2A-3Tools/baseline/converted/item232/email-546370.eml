Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to provide you with an update regarding Mr. Adams' investment portfolio, as discussed during our last meeting.

Unfortunately, we have observed a notable downturn in the portfolio’s performance over the last three months. The market turbulence, especially in the technology and energy sectors, has directly impacted several of the key holdings in Mr. Adams’ portfolio. As of yesterday, the portfolio showed an overall loss of 8.3% compared to its value at the end of Q3 2021.

Our analysis attributes this loss primarily to the underperformance of [specific fund/investment], as well as increased volatility across multiple sectors. While such fluctuations can be expected in the short term, I would recommend discussing possible adjustments to the portfolio to better align it with current market conditions and Mr. Adams' long-term financial goals.

Would it be possible to schedule a call or meeting this week to address these concerns in detail? Please let me know your availability, and I’ll be happy to coordinate accordingly. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any immediate questions or if additional information is required.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Sarah Lee
