Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of the ongoing discussions regarding Project Falcon, I wanted to touch base on the next steps so we can ensure everything is aligned and on schedule.

Following our last meeting, here are the key action items and points requiring attention:

1. **Timeline Review**: Please confirm whether the revised timeline we shared last week works on your end. If there are any adjustments needed, let us know by Friday, January 28, 2022.

2. **Team Assignments**: I’ve attached a preliminary list of team assignments for various sub-projects. Feel free to suggest modifications or reassignments if necessary.

3. **Budget Approval**: We’re awaiting final input regarding the Q1 allocation for Falcon. Kindly provide feedback or approval by January 25, 2022, so we can finalize planning.

Let me know a convenient time for a short check-in call next week to review these items and address any questions you might have. If there’s anything else you’d like to discuss or add to the agenda, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
