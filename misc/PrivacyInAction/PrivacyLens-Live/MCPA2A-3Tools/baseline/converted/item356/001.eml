Dear Study Group Participants,

I hope this message finds you well. Due to a scheduling conflict, we will need to reschedule our upcoming study session originally planned for this Thursday. I propose we move it to the following Monday at the same time. Please let me know if this works for everyone.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
