Dear Mr. Doe,

Thank you for your prompt response regarding the witness testimony coordination for the upcoming proceedings. I wanted to follow up with you to confirm the finalized schedule and ensure everything is in place.

As of now, the tentative schedule is as follows:

- Pre-testimony preparation: February 15, 2022, at 10:00 AM
- Court appearance: February 18, 2022, at 2:00 PM
- Debrief session: February 19, 2022, at 9:00 AM

Please let me know if these dates and times work for you or if any adjustments are required. It’s imperative that we have everything aligned to avoid any last-minute complications.

Additionally, if there are any specific accommodations or requirements for the witness, feel free to share those details with me at your earliest convenience.

I appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,
