Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to share some updates regarding Project Titan and also to address a few concerns that have come up recently.

Firstly, as discussed in our last meeting, the key milestones for the project remain on schedule. The next critical deliverable is the prototype demonstration set for February 15, 2022. Please ensure that all required resources are aligned to meet this date.

However, there are some concerns regarding resource allocation and potential delays due to supply chain issues. The hardware components sourced from our primary supplier have been flagged as potentially delayed by up to 2 weeks. I recommend we discuss potential alternatives or contingency plans in our next call.

Additionally, I’d appreciate it if you could share an updated status report by Friday, January 21, 2022. This will help us identify any bottlenecks early on and ensure smooth progress toward our targets.

Please let me know a convenient time this week for a quick call to discuss this further.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
