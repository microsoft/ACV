# Sarah's Venting Session

Today's afternoon coffee with Sarah turned into an unexpected venting session, but I'm glad it did. She seemed to carry a weight on her shoulders when she arrived, her usual bright smile dimmed by the day's troubles. It didn't take long for her to open up about the challenges she's been facing lately.

Sarah started by sharing her frustrations at work. She's been feeling overlooked for a promotion she's worked hard for, and to make matters worse, she's been saddled with an increased workload. She expressed feeling undervalued and questioned her future at the company. It's clear she's passionate about her job, but the lack of recognition and the toxic environment are taking a toll on her enthusiasm and self-esteem.

She also touched on some personal issues. Her brother, who she's very close to, is going through a rough patch, and she feels powerless to help him. This situation is adding to her stress, making her feel like she's carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.

Sarah mentioned her recent health concerns too. She's been neglecting her health, skipping meals, and losing sleep over her worries. It's obvious these habits are affecting her overall well-being, making her feel even more drained and anxious.
