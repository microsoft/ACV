Hi Sarah,

Following our recent discussions, I've compiled an overview of the budget allocations for the past year, as well as projections for the upcoming quarters. Enclosed, you'll find a breakdown of expenses by department, highlighting how funds have been distributed across various initiatives. This should give you a clear picture of where we stand financially and help in planning your marketing strategies effectively.

Please let me know if you need further details or have any questions.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
HR Manager
