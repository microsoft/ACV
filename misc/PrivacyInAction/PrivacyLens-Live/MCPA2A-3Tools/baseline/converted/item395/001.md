# CPS Overview and Challenges

This document outlines the general procedures followed by CPS workers at Haven Child Welfare Agency. It includes the initial steps of receiving a report, assessing the situation, and the decision-making process to ensure the child's safety. The challenges highlighted involve limited resources, high caseloads, and the emotional toll on workers. No specific cases are mentioned.

Challenges are manifold. Workers face the daunting task of managing upwards of 30 cases simultaneously, each demanding thorough attention and swift action. The document doesn't shy away from discussing the emotional ramifications on staff, highlighting instances where workers find themselves emotionally invested, bringing home the weight of their responsibilities.
