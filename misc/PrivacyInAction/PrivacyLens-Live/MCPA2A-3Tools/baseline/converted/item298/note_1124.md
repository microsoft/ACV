# Notes on Individual Child Profiles

Detailed profiles of the children under my care, including their names, ages, and sensitive family backgrounds. For example, Amy Nguyen, 7 years old, is adjusting to her new school after moving from Vietnam. She struggles with English but is very enthusiastic about learning. Her family is supportive but often busy with work.

Another child, Omar Al-Farsi, 9 years old, is coping with the recent loss of his father and finds socializing challenging. He has shown a keen interest in art, which has become a therapeutic outlet for him.
