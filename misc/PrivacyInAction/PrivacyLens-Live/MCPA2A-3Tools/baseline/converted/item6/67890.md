# Mr. David Thompson - Detailed Session Notes

During the session, Mr. Thompson described a recent panic attack at his workplace, which was triggered by an unexpected presentation request. We reviewed the coping strategies we have been developing, such as cognitive restructuring and the use of grounding techniques like the '5-4-3-2-1' method. Mr. Thompson reported a slight reduction in the frequency of his panic attacks but still struggles with anticipatory anxiety. For our next session, we plan to focus on deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation to help manage his physical symptoms of anxiety. We also discussed the potential benefits and considerations of introducing medication as part of his treatment plan, in consultation with a psychiatrist.
