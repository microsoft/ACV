Dear Harrison,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance and transparency, I am reaching out to confirm the delivery of the audit summaries. Please find attached the documentation detailing the findings and recommendations from the recent audit assessments conducted during Q4.

The summarized reports highlight the key areas of compliance, areas that require immediate attention, and our proposed action plans to address any noted discrepancies. Your review and feedback will be crucial before we finalize these reports for submission to the compliance board. 

If you require further clarification or additional documents, please don't hesitate to reach out. I’d appreciate it if you could provide your input by the end of next week to ensure we remain on track with our deadlines.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
