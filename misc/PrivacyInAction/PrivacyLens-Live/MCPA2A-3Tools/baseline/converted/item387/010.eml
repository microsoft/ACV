Dear Amelia,

Thank you for reaching out to Wanderlust Adventures! I hope this message finds you well. I received your inquiry regarding additional services and would be happy to provide more information to ensure your experience with us meets all your travel needs.

At Wanderlust Adventures, we offer a wide range of supplementary services, including personalized travel itineraries, private guided tours, and premium concierge assistance. If you have specific requirements or preferences, please feel free to share them, and I’ll make sure to tailor our services accordingly.

To assist you further, could you provide a bit more information about your upcoming trip? For instance:
- The destination(s) you have in mind
- Your travel dates
- Any particular activities or experiences you would like included

Once I have these details, I’ll promptly send you a detailed outline of options we can provide, along with any corresponding costs.

Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this via phone, please let me know a time that works for you, and I’ll arrange a call.

Looking forward to helping you create an unforgettable adventure!
