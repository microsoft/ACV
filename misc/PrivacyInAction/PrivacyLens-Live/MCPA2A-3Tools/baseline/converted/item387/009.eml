Hi John,

Thank you for getting back to me regarding my special requests for the upcoming tour. I really appreciate your help in making this trip enjoyable and tailored to my preferences.

I just wanted to confirm the following details to ensure everything is in place:

1. **Meal Preferences**: As discussed, I would prefer vegetarian meals throughout the trip. Please let me know if there are any specific restaurants or meal plans you’ve arranged, especially for the first two days.

2. **Accommodations**: I requested a room with a view at each of the hotels. Could you confirm if this has been secured?

3. **Transportation**: I understand that a private vehicle has been arranged for the city tours. Can you confirm the vehicle type? If possible, I'd prefer an SUV for added comfort.

4. **Activity Itinerary**: Regarding the snorkeling trip, could you provide specific timings and locations? Additionally, are there any other recommended activities that might align with my interests?

Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification from my side. I’m looking forward to having everything confirmed beforehand to make the experience as seamless as possible.

Thank you again for your attention to these details. I’m excited about the tour and appreciate the effort you’re putting into making it a memorable experience.

Best regards,  
James
