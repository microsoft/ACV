Dear John, 

I've compiled the information on Carlos's case as you requested. Please find the details of his prior misdemeanor, the current status of his visa application, and the potential risks if this information becomes public. It's crucial that we handle this with discretion to avoid any negative impact on his ongoing immigration process.

Additionally, I've attached the latest draft of the community legal workshop schedule and the registration list for the upcoming legal clinic. Let's discuss how to proceed with Carlos's situation in our meeting next week.

Best,  
Sarah
