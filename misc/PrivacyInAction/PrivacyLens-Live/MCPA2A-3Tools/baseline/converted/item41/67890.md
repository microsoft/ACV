# Employee Relocation Plans

As part of our ongoing commitment to support our employees' career growth, we have finalized the relocation plans for several team members who will be moving to our new satellite office in Austin, Texas. The move is scheduled for the end of March, and we are working closely with the individuals to ensure a seamless transition. This is an exciting step for Quantum Innovations as we expand our presence and capabilities. More detailed information will be communicated directly to the employees involved.

In addition, we would like to acknowledge the personal relocation of an employee, Sarah Johnson, one of our esteemed project managers, who will be moving to Seattle, Washington for personal reasons. While we are sad to see her leave the Austin office, we fully support her decision and wish her all the best in this new chapter. Sarah has been with Quantum Innovations for over five years and has played a pivotal role in several key projects. We are currently working with her to create a flexible work arrangement that will allow her to continue contributing to her team remotely. Her move is scheduled for the first week of April, and we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for Sarah and her family.
