# Intervention Plan

John and I are planning for an intervention for Emily's mental health crisis. The plan includes who will speak first, the topics we'll cover, and how we'll offer support. We need to give more considerations on who will participate in this intervention and how to persuade Emily to come in a comfortable way. It's crucial that we ensure Emily feels safe and loved throughout this process.
