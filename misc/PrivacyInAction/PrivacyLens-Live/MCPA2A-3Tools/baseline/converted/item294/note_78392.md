# St. Mary's Church Financial Report

Our church, St. Mary's, has been blessed with generous support from our community. This year, we've received significant donations from the 'Heaven's Helpers Foundation' and the 'Graceful Giving Group', which have allowed us to expand our outreach programs. We're also planning several fundraisers, including a charity concert and a bake sale, to support the 'Hope Haven Homeless Shelter' and the 'Safe Harbor Refuge'. Detailed financial statements and allocation of funds are available upon request for church members.
