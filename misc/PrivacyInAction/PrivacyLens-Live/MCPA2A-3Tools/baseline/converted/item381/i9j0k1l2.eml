Hi Mark,

Thank you for getting back to me regarding the upcoming workshop coordination. I really appreciate your quick response and willingness to collaborate on this.

As discussed, we need to finalize the schedule and list of participants by next Friday, February 4th, to ensure there’s enough time to prepare the necessary materials. I’d also appreciate it if you could confirm the venue details, as well as any specific AV equipment requirements that we might need to arrange in advance.

Additionally, if you foresee any challenges or need assistance with any aspect of planning, please let me know, and I’d be happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
