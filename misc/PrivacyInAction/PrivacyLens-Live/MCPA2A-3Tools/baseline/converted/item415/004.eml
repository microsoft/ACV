Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the research project we’ve been working on. 

As of now, the data collection phase is progressing as planned, and we are on track to meet our initial timeline. I've reviewed the preliminary results from the first data set, and they’re yielding some promising insights. It’s still early to draw definitive conclusions, but this is a strong start.

For the next steps, I will be refining the analysis and focusing on integrating the secondary data sources. If it's convenient for you, let us schedule a call or meeting to discuss the finer details of the findings and align on the next steps. Please let me know your availability this week.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or additional inputs that you would like to share at this stage. 

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
