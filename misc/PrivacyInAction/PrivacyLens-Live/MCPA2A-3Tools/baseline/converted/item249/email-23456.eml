Hi Emily,

I hope this email finds you well! I’m reaching out to start coordinating the details for our upcoming joint fundraiser. I believe this event can be a great success if we work closely together to finalize the plans.

Could we schedule a meeting sometime next week to discuss the main objectives, logistics, and a timeline for the event? Please let me know your availability, and I’ll do my best to align my schedule. Additionally, if there’s already been any groundwork laid for the fundraiser, feel free to share any relevant details, so I can review them beforehand.

Looking forward to collaborating on this and making it a memorable and impactful event for our community.

Best regards,  
John Doe
