# Effective Study Habits

Compiled a list of effective study habits that can help students manage their time better and reduce stress. These include the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break, active recall, which is the practice of testing oneself on the material to be learned, and spaced repetition, a technique that involves spreading out study sessions over time to improve long-term retention.
