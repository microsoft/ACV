Hello,

I wanted to provide you with an update on Timmy's condition. We've been monitoring his asthma closely and have adjusted his medication accordingly. Additionally, he has fully recovered from his recent bout of pneumonia. It's important that Timmy continues to avoid allergens and follows the asthma action plan we discussed. Please see the attached detailed notes from our last few appointments for more information.

Best wishes,
Jane Doe
