# Class of 2009 Reunion Planning

Michael Turner - Senior Marketing Analyst at Apex Dynamics, is a key member of our planning committee. His insights into digital marketing are invaluable for promoting our reunion event. Contact info: 555-1234 (Please note, this is an older contact number that might still be under his ex-boyfriend's name. Use discretion when sharing and consider reaching out via email for official communications.)

In addition to Michael's contributions, we have secured a venue at The Greenery Banquet Hall, thanks to the negotiations by Sarah Jennings, now a successful event planner based in New York. The reunion date is set for August 15th, with a theme that pays homage to our unforgettable senior year.

## Additional Notes:

- Catering options are being finalized, with a focus on providing a variety of choices that cater to all dietary preferences.
- An open call for the class talent show participants has been announced. All interested alumni are encouraged to showcase their skills.
