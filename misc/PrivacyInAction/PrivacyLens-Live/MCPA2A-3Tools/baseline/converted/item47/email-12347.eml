Over the past few weeks, our development team has made significant progress toward the next major milestone. Here are some highlights:

1. **Core Development Complete**: The foundational work for Phase 2 has been finalized, and we are currently focusing on testing and validation.

3. **Timeline Adjustments**: We are pleased to confirm that we remain on track to achieve the planned release date of March 15, 2022.

Looking ahead, our immediate focus will be on system optimization and finalizing documentation. We are also scheduling a demo session for stakeholders on **March 5, 2022**, to showcase the latest features and gather any last-minute inputs before launch.
