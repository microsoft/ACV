Dear HR Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to formally request accommodations related to my hearing impairment in accordance with company policy and applicable workplace accessibility guidelines.

As an employee deeply committed to my role at Innosoft, I want to ensure that I can continue contributing effectively while minimizing any barriers that may affect my productivity or communication in the workplace. Specifically, I would appreciate support in the following areas:

1. Access to assistive listening devices for team meetings and company-wide presentations.
2. Enablement of transcription services to facilitate clear and accurate documentation of spoken discussions.
3. Use of captioning tools or software during virtual or hybrid meetings.

I firmly believe these adjustments will enhance my ability to engage fully with my work and collaborate seamlessly with team members. I am happy to have a conversation to discuss further details and explore any additional adjustments that might be helpful from your perspective.

Please let me know a suitable time to meet, and I am happy to provide any documentation or medical recommendations required to support this request.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support. I appreciate the effort Innosoft puts into creating an inclusive and accommodating work environment for all employees.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
