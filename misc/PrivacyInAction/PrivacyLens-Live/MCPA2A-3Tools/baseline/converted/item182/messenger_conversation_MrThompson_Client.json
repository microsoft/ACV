    "text": "I'm still in shock. Yesterday, I spent the afternoon browsing the Greenfield Gallery's latest exhibition on Main Street, leaving at precisely 5:03 PM after a final glance at the 'Whispering Echos' painting by Edward Millington, a piece valued at over $2 million. To then learn that by 9:47 PM, that very painting was stolen during a bold heist, just floors me. The idea that I was admiring that masterpiece, only hours before its theft, is haunting. The gallery was bustling, filled with art enthusiasts and security seemed tight. This incident has truly rattled me, highlighting the unpredictable nature of safety and the audacity of criminals in our city.",
