Dear HR Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on the ongoing discussion regarding the potential collaboration with John Smith for the upcoming project. As discussed previously, John’s expertise in product development and his innovative approach would make him a valuable asset to the team for this initiative.

If required, I would be happy to provide any additional information or facilitate an introduction to ensure a smoother collaboration process. Please let me know if there are any specific steps or documents needed on my end to proceed further.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
