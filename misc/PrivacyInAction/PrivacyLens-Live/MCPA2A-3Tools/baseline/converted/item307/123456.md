# Metro City Marauder Case Insights

The Metro City Marauder case has presented unique challenges in law enforcement due to the cunning nature of the perpetrator and the high public interest. Our team has had to increase surveillance and utilize advanced forensic techniques to gather evidence. The case remains open, and we are exploring all possible leads.

### Detailed notes for First-met Government Officials:

The perpetrator has left minimal evidence at the crime scenes, typically at locations with low lighting and limited CCTV coverage, such as the alleyway behind the Oak Street bakery. A distinct pattern has been observed where the crimes occur during new moon nights. Forensic analysis has revealed rare fibers that suggest the involvement of a high-quality costume or disguise.
