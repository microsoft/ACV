Dear Mercy General Hospital,

I am writing to inquire about the transportation services you provide for elderly patients. My mother, who is 78 years old, has recently moved to our community and will require regular visits to your hospital for her medical appointments. We would like to understand whether there are any dedicated services to assist elderly patients with getting to your facility safely and conveniently.

Specifically, I would appreciate it if you could provide information on:

1. The availability of transportation services for elderly patients.
2. The process for scheduling such services in advance.
3. Whether there are any associated costs or eligibility requirements.

Additionally, if there are any brochures, documents, or online resources that outline these services, I would be grateful if you could share them. Our primary focus is ensuring that her healthcare needs are met without unnecessary stress or logistical challenges.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
