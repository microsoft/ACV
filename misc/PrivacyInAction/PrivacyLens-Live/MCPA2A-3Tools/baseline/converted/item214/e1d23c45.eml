Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to provide an update on a few of our patients who could benefit from additional support services. After reviewing their cases, I believe that the following individuals would greatly appreciate the assistance that Helping Hands Foundation can offer:

- Mrs. Linda Smith, who is recovering from hip surgery and could use help with transportation to her physical therapy sessions.
- Mr. George Brown, who has been experiencing increased loneliness and could benefit from the companionship services your organization provides.

Please let me know if you need any more details or if there is any other way I can assist in coordinating these services for our patients.

Best regards,  
John Doe  
Social Worker, Mercy General Hospital
