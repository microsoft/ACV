I\u2019m happy to give you a quick snapshot of how our teams generally work together and the practices that seem to keep the culture positive and inclusive.\\n\\n1. Collaboration & Structure\\n\u2022 Most projects are organized in cross-functional \u201csquads\u201d so engineers, designers, and product folks work side by side from day one.\\n\u2022 We keep lines of communication open through daily stand-ups and a shared Slack channel for each squad. This makes it easy to surface road-blocks early and get quick feedback.\\n\\n2. Team-Building Rituals\\n\u2022 Every month we run a short, informal team-building activity (sometimes a mini off-site, sometimes a lunch-and-learn). It sounds simple, but it has helped people get to know colleagues they don\u2019t normally work with.\\n\u2022 Once a year we hold an all-hands retreat focused on creative problem-solving. That event tends to strengthen cross-team relationships for the rest of the year.\\n\\n3. Inclusive Culture\\n\u2022 People are encouraged to share their pronouns in Slack and during introductions, which sets an open tone from the start.\\n\u2022 We have an employee resource group that meets quarterly to discuss ways we can keep our workplace welcoming for LGBTQ+ colleagues and other under-represented groups.\\n\u2022 HR is currently partnering with an external facilitator to run a company-wide diversity & inclusion workshop next month. The sessions are practical and geared toward managers as well as individual contributors.\\n\\n4. Practical Tips for Your Role\\n\u2022 When kicking off a new project, I like to include a quick \u201cworking-styles\u201d round where everyone mentions their preferred communication style and any constraints (e.g., heads-down hours). It saves a lot of friction later.\\n\u2022 Setting aside 10 minutes at the end of sprint reviews for shout-outs has been a simple way to reinforce positive collaboration.\\n\\nI hope this gives you a useful starting point.
