Hi Alex,

Thanks for jumping on the new marketing collateral so quickly. Below is a concise background packet to orient your design work. Let me know if anything else would be helpful and I’ll track it down right away.

——————————————————
INNOTECH AT A GLANCE
Founded: 2008
Headquarters: San Francisco, CA
Focus: Innovative, data-driven software that helps businesses work smarter and scale faster.

MISSION & VALUES
• Mission –  “Create software that empowers businesses to achieve more, faster.”
• Core Values –  Customer-centricity | Innovation | Teamwork | Integrity | Creativity

BRAND PERSONALITY
Forward-thinking, approachable, quietly confident. Tone is professional but conversational—cutting-edge without sounding aloof.

LOGO & COLOR BASICS (current)
• Primary logo: stylised lowercase “innotech” word-mark with rounded corners.
• Color palette (RGB / HEX):
  – Deep Blue   #0A3E8F   (trust, stability – primary)
  – Vibrant Teal #19C2B3   (innovation, energy – accent)
  – Warm Gray    #F4F5F7   (background / whitespace)
*If you need the vector file just let me know; I can send the .svg and .eps packages.*

RECENT POSITIONING / PRESS
We consistently frame ourselves as the “innovation engine” for mid-market and enterprise clients. Last year we were featured in TechCrunch’s “Top 50 B2B SaaS Innovators” list (Sept-2024) and won the 2024 Enterprise UX Award.

PRODUCT LAUNCH – PROJECT FALCON
Goal: Showcase our new AI-powered analytics dashboard that surfaces real-time business insights.
Key value pillars  ➜  Speed of insight | Predictive recommendations | Seamless integration with existing data stacks.

High-Level Timeline
• Soft Launch (private beta): mid-May 2025 (Q2)
• Public Launch & media push: late-July 2025 (Q3)
• Conference unveiling: SaaSConnect, Aug-18-20, 2025

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
✓ Please emphasise clarity and forward motion—clean lines, generous white space.
✓ Imagery: diverse, collaborative teams in modern workspaces + abstract data/analytics motifs.
✓ Avoid overly tech-jargon visuals (servers, circuit boards, etc.).
✓ Responsive assets—core deliverables should scale for web, mobile, and large-format booth graphics.

ASSETS INCLUDED / TO FOLLOW
• Attached: none (email system limitation). I’ll send separate Drive link with: logo suite, icon set, previous one-pager, and last year’s press kit PDF.
• In development: full 2025 Brand Guidelines doc—expected from Marketing by Friday; I’ll forward as soon as I have it.

Hope this gives you a solid starting point. Call or email anytime if you want to workshop initial concepts.

Best,
