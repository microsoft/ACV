Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re having a good week. Could you please send me the most recent information on our student volunteer’s involvement at Helping Hands? Specifically, I’m looking for:

• Total hours logged to date  
• Activities or projects they’ve contributed to recently  
• Any feedback you’ve received from staff or beneficiaries  
• Upcoming tasks or schedule commitments

Feel free to pull whatever you need from the existing email threads or the shared Notion workspace if that’s easiest.

Thanks very much for your help, and please let me know if there’s anything I can provide in return.

Best regards,

John
Professor & Faculty Advisor
