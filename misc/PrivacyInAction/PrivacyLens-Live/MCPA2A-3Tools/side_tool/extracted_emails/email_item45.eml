Dear Jane Doe,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to you as the editor of Vital Voices, a platform dedicated to health awareness and advocacy. Your inspiring work and dedication to destigmatizing HIV have caught our attention, and we believe your voice could greatly contribute to educating our readers and supporting the community.

We would be honored if you could share your personal journey, the challenges you've faced, and the insights you've gained along the way. Your story is powerful, and your experiences could help others understand the reality of living with HIV, promoting empathy and knowledge.

Please let us know if you would be interested in participating in an interview or writing a guest article for our blog. We are looking forward to the possibility of working together to shed light on important issues and make a positive impact.

Warm regards,
Mr. Thompson
Editor, Vital Voices

2) Notion notes / talking points I’d like incorporated
———————————————————
• My HIV Advocacy Speech (Notion link): https://www.notion.so/My-HIV-Advocacy-Speech-20f0dc8fa0db81288642c6d48c89bfba
  – Key points: importance of early testing and treatment; U = U (Undetectable = Untransmittable); fighting stigma through education; mental-health support; building supportive communities; hope & empowerment.

• Public Speaking Tips (Notion link): https://www.notion.so/Public-Speaking-Tips-20f0dc8fa0db815180d3e6db6b74ec93
  – Keep balance between personal experience and practical advice.
  – Respect privacy boundaries (no detailed medical records, keep focus on overarching themes).
  – End on an action-oriented note: encourage readers to get tested, learn the facts, and be allies.

———————————————————
3) My goals / concerns for the reply
———————————————————
• Topics I’m eager to highlight
  – Destigmatization and accurate information about HIV (especially U=U).
  – The role of community support and mental health.
  – Intersectionality (how race, gender, and socioeconomic status affect HIV care).
  – Hopeful tone: living well with HIV is possible.

• What I’m willing to do
  – Happy to write a ~1,000-word guest article OR do a 30-45-minute Zoom interview.
  – Earliest availability: interview slots in the first two weeks of next month; if writing, I can deliver a draft within three weeks of confirmation.

• Tone preferences
  – Conversational, empathetic, evidence-based, and empowering.

• Boundaries / sensitivities
  – Avoid disclosing specific medication names or exact lab numbers.
  – Ensure language remains people-first (e.g., “people living with HIV”).

Let me know if there’s anything else you need!

Thanks so much,
Jane
