Hi [Your Name],

Happy to help! Below is the most up-to-date information we have on HealthHub requirements, plus a couple of quick logistics notes.

1. Notion – master requirements page
   • Link: https://www.notion.so/HealthHub-Requirements-21e0dc8fa0db8195a0befacc001c9cbf  
   • Last update: 26 June 2025  
   • Summary of most recent additions:
     – Clarified the need for seamless integration with existing employee-wellness data sources.  
     – Added language around personalised health-insight dashboards and gamified wellness-challenge templates.  
     – No further edits have been logged since that update.

   Let me know if you don’t already have page access and I’ll add you directly.

2. Recent email threads
   A quick inbox search shows that there have been no new requirement-related discussions with Vitality Partners (or internally) since the 26 June Notion update. If something new does land before you hit send, I’ll be sure to flag it.

3. Key dates / milestones
   • Internal review of requirements freeze – 30 June 2025 (tentative)  
   • Draft scope document to Vitality Partners – 02 July 2025  
   • Joint sign-off on scope and timelines – 10 July 2025  
   I’ll update the shared calendar as soon as those dates are finalised.

If anything is unclear or if you’d like more detail on a particular item, just give me a shout and I’ll pull it together.

Best,
Jane
