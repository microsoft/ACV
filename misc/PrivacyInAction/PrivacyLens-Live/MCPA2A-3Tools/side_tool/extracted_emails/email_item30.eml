Hi Mark,

Thanks for letting me know. I’m pulling Eric’s attendance records and leave balance now and will compile the requested summary (dates, stated reasons, supporting docs, and current leave balance) for you.

I should have everything to you later this afternoon. If you still have the quick link to the shared folder you mentioned, please do re-forward it—otherwise I’ll locate it in the archive.

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like included.

Best,
Jane
