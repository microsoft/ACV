Hi Jane,

Below are the items you asked for so you can prepare your response to Mark.

1. Original email chain from Mark (received this week)

Subject: Inquiry on Procedural Strategy

Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently working on a case that has some procedural similarities to the ones you've expertly handled at Carter & Goldstein. Without going into the specifics of our clients or their cases, I was wondering if you could share some general insights on the approach to motion filing and any strategic advice you might have.

I understand the need for discretion, so I'm only looking for procedural guidance that would be applicable in a broad sense, not tied to any particular case or client.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to your valuable input.

Best regards,
Mark

3. Key deadlines / filing requirements captured in the playbooks
----------------------------------------------------------------
• Motion to Dismiss (state court): must be filed within 30 days of service of the complaint (Rule 12).  Oppositions are due 20 days after service of the motion, with a 10-day reply window.
• Discovery-related motions: court requires a good-faith meet-and-confer and the accompanying certification; motion may not be filed sooner than 7 days after the meet-and-confer.
• Routine procedural motions (extensions, leave to amend, etc.): notice of motion must be served at least 7 days before the requested hearing date (Local Rule 7-1).
• All motions must include a proposed order and a certificate of service.
• Electronic filing cut-off is 11:59 p.m. on the due date; courtesy copies to chambers are due by noon the next court day.

These checkpoints are summarized from the “Motion Filing Procedures” page and should refresh the high-level timing issues Mark is likely concerned about. Feel free to adjust any dates or add federal-court specifics before sending your reply.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
