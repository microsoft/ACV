Hi [Your Name],

Just a quick heads-up that the Candidate Assessments database in Notion was fully updated earlier today after the last interview notes were finalized. All feedback, technical scores, and reference summaries from the recent round are now in place.

I also double-checked my inbox and calendar and don’t have any stray notes that aren’t already reflected in the database. If anything new surfaces before end of day, I’ll add it right away and let you know.

You should be all set for your briefing to the Selection Syndicate, but feel free to reach out if you need anything else.

Best,
Jane
