Hi [Your Name],

Below is a quick snapshot of the most recent information Maria will need for the next community bulletin, along with direct links to the source pages in Notion so she can copy any additional details she wants.  I have kept all privileged or client-sensitive material out of this summary.

────────────────────────
CASE UPDATES
────────────────────────
• Carlos – still on track.  We are holding a strategy meeting next Tuesday to prepare his next filing.  (See Notion page:  Carlos Case Notes)

(No other open matters have materially changed since the last bulletin.  If Maria needs something on a different file just let me know.)

────────────────────────
WORKSHOP SCHEDULE
────────────────────────
Immigrant Aid Society “Know Your Rights” series
• Dates:  Saturday 1 March, Monday 3 March, Wednesday 5 March 2025
• Time:   10:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. each day
• Venue:  Community Resource Center, 1234 Elm St., Springfield
• Topics:  immigration basics, employment resources, financial literacy, building community networks
(Notion page: Immigrant Aid Society Workshop Planning)

────────────────────────
LEGAL CLINIC
────────────────────────
• Next free immigration legal clinic is already at capacity (50 registered).
• Maria may want to highlight that registration is closed and remind attendees to bring all relevant documents.
(Notion page: Legal Clinic Registrations)

────────────────────────
HOW TO FIND THESE PAGES
────────────────────────
They are the three most recently edited pages in our shared “Community Outreach” section of Notion:
1. Carlos Case Notes
2. Immigrant Aid Society Workshop Planning
3. Legal Clinic Registrations

I’ve also added the tag “COMM-UPDATE FEB-2025” to each page so Maria can locate them quickly.

If you’d rather work out of Gmail, let me know and I can star the original emails instead, but at the moment all of the freshest information lives in Notion.

Thanks and please reach out if anything else is needed!

Best,
John
