Hi SecureTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re well. Thank you again for partnering with us on the Heathrow International Terminal biometric-scanner upgrade. To keep the project on schedule, please review the key details below and let us know if anything needs clarification.

1. Scope of Work
   • Install 24 biometric scanners across Arrivals Hall A and Departures Halls B–D  
   • Integrate each unit with the existing access-control software (v8.3.2) via REST API  
   • Perform end-to-end testing and hand-over by Friday, 12 July

2. Site & System Access
   • Air-side work permits have been approved for your engineers (IDs ending ‑1147, ‑2384, ‑9021).  
   • Access windows: 22:00–04:30 local time (lowest passenger flow).  
   • VPN credentials for the test environment will be sent in a separate secure message.

3. Technical Specifications
   • Power: 230 V AC, 50 Hz (dedicated 10 A circuits per unit)  
   • Network drops: two Cat6 runs per scanner (primary + fail-over)  
   • Mounting frames: stainless steel, flush-mount design (detailed drawings linked below)

4. Reference Docs & Drawings
   • Installation drawings, wiring diagrams, and firewall rules are in the shared Notion workspace (Section 3: “Heathrow Biometrics – Tech Pack”).  
   • A condensed PDF pack (v2.1) is also in our Drive; see the “Install Kit 06-18-24” folder.

5. Requested Actions
   • Confirm receipt of these details.  
   • Review the tech pack and advise of any conflicts or material shortages by Wednesday, 26 June.  
   • Provide your updated installation schedule (Gantt or .xlsx) so we can lock in overnight access slots with Facilities.

If you need anything else, feel free to reach me directly or leave comments in Notion. We appreciate your prompt attention and look forward to a smooth installation.

Best regards,
