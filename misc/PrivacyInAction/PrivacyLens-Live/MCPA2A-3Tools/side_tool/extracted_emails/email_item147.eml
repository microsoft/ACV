Dear [Your Name],

Thank you for putting together the briefing for Tom at HopeBridge. Below are the core materials that can be shared externally and that capture our most up-to-date recommendations:

1. Support Strategies for Refugee Students  
   https://www.notion.so/Support-Strategies-for-Refugee-Students-21e0dc8fa0db8185b5b9eb30e66e4f0b  
   • Concise guide to best-practice academic and psychosocial interventions (ESL pathways, mentoring model, trauma-informed advising, community-building activities).  
   • Includes an implementation checklist and a quick-reference sheet for frontline staff.

2. Integration of Refugee Students into Higher Education  
   https://www.notion.so/Integration-of-Refugee-Students-into-Higher-Education-21e0dc8fa0db81228707ef2181ab7691  
   • Overview of structural and cultural barriers, with evidence-based solutions.  
   • Features summaries of three successful programmes we have piloted on campus.

Additional materials
• Slide deck: “Building Inclusive Classrooms for Refugee Learners” (20-min presentation). Let me know if a PDF or the original PowerPoint would be most useful and I will forward it.  
• Recommended reading list (peer-reviewed articles + practitioner reports) – available as an appendix in the first Notion page above.

Data-sensitive items  
A few of our richer case studies (e.g., “Amina’s Journey”) contain confidential personal and immigration details, so I will keep those internal for now. Where illustrative examples are helpful, I have anonymised key take-aways in the Integration page.

If there is anything else Tom would find helpful, just let me know and I can surface it.

Warm regards,

Jane
