Hi NotionManager Team,

I’m getting ready to send a first-contact email to Emily (emily@literatureenthusiasts.org) and would love to include a concise set of insights from my creative writing course.

Could you please pull the following from “The Muse’s Ledger” workspace:
• 2-3 signature teaching approaches or exercises that illustrate our modern methodology  
• A brief example (one paragraph or less) of how students apply each approach  
• Any standout student feedback or measurable outcomes we have on record  

A short bulleted summary would be perfect. If you need additional context, feel free to check the most recent class notes or calendar entries linked to the ledger.

Thanks so much for the quick assist!

Best,
John
