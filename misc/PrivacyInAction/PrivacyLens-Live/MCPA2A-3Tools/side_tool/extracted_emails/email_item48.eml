Dear Owlet Families,

I hope you’re all doing well.  Our new class project is about to begin, and I’d love your help getting everything organized so the students can dive right in.

Could you please take a few minutes this week to do the following?

1. Review the Project Overview  
   • You’ll find a concise summary, timeline, and goals in Notion (Oakwood Owlets Workspace → “Spring Group Project”).  
   • If you have any questions after reading, feel free to reply directly to this email.

2. Confirm Your Child’s Interests & Availability  
   • In the same Notion page, there’s a short form where you can note your child’s preferred task (research, design, building, etc.) and any days/times they are unavailable for group work.  
   • Kindly submit the form by Friday, April 26.

3. Sign Up for a Volunteer Slot (optional but appreciated!)  
   • We need parent support for small-group supervision, material prep, and a final-presentation day.  
   • A Google Calendar link with dates/times is included in the email you’ll receive shortly from Gmail. Please claim any slot that works for you.

4. Let Us Know About Supplies You Can Provide  
   • There’s a “Materials Tracker” table in Notion. If you already have items we need (cardboard, markers, craft tools, etc.), just add your name next to the item so we avoid duplicate purchases.

Having this information in place will let the Owlets hit the ground running and keep our project timeline on track. Thank you so much for your prompt attention and continued support!

Warm regards,

Jane
