Hi [Your Name],

As requested, I pulled together the most current materials and talking points we have on establishing credit in the U.S. for newcomers. I did a sweep of our Grandstone Gmail threads and Notion space; while I found past exchanges with Carlos, they primarily contained personalized or confidential data, so I distilled only the compliant educational content below.

====================
READY-TO-USE BULLET POINTS
====================

1. Secured & Starter Cards
• Grandstone Secured Visa® – $300–$3,000 refundable deposit, graduates to unsecured after 12 on-time payments.
• Grandstone StartUP℠ Card – no annual fee, designed for thin-file applicants with ITINs; automatically reviews for credit-line increase at month 7.
• Key talking point: keep utilization under 30% (ideally <10%) and pay in full by the statement due date.

2. Responsible Card Use
• Set up autopay for at least the statement balance to avoid late fees and preserve payment history (35% of FICO score).
• Keep total revolving balances low; high utilization can drop a score even if payments are on time.
• Avoid unnecessary hard inquiries—space new credit applications at least six months apart.

3. Credit-Builder Loans & Alternate Data
• Grandstone Credit Builder Loan – $500–$2,500; loan proceeds are held in a savings account and released once paid off, reporting monthly to all three CRAs.
• Self-funded loan programs (e.g., Self, SeedFi) operate similarly and are good external referrals.
• Rent-reporting services (e.g., Esusu, RentTrack) can add up to 24 months of positive history to TransUnion & Equifax files.

4. SSN / ITIN Considerations
• Applicants without an SSN can apply with an ITIN for both the Secured Visa and Credit Builder Loan.
• Once an SSN is issued, they should send a copy to each CRA to merge the ITIN and SSN files and preserve existing history.

5. Recent Policy Updates (internal memo Q2-2025)
• Minimum deposit for Secured Visa lowered from $500 to $300.
• ITIN applicants now eligible for auto-graduation review after 12 months (previously manual request required).
• New Rent-Reporting API partnership goes live in August; participants will receive a 0.25% APR discount on the Credit Builder Loan.

Hi Carlos,

I’m glad you reached out about building credit in the U.S.—getting started the right way makes a huge difference long term. Below is a step-by-step roadmap you can follow and share with fellow New Horizons members:

1. Open a Secured Credit Card
   • Consider the Grandstone Secured Visa® (or any major-bank secured card) and place a deposit you can comfortably manage.
   • Use the card for a small recurring expense (e.g., cell-phone bill) and pay it off in full each month.

2. Keep Utilization Low
   • Aim to use no more than 10–30% of your credit limit at any time.
   • Set up balance alerts in the mobile app.

3. Pay EVERYTHING On Time
   • Enable autopay for at least the minimum; late payments stay on a report for seven years.
   • This applies to loans, utilities, and any rent-reporting service you enroll in.

4. Consider a Credit-Builder Loan After 3–6 Months
   • A small installment loan diversifies your credit mix and shows lenders you can handle fixed payments.

5. Report Positive Rent History
   • Services like Esusu or RentTrack can add your current lease to your credit files, giving you up to two years of history instantly.

6. SSN / ITIN Tips for Newcomers
   • If you only have an ITIN today, you can still start. Once you receive an SSN, send a copy of both numbers to each credit bureau so your history stays intact.
