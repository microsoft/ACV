Hi [Your Name],

I’ve pulled together the latest Q2 information for both the Software Development and Digital Marketing teams. You can find everything in our shared Notion space and the linked Google Drive workbook so that Mark and Sarah always have a single source of truth.

1. Team-level Performance Metrics (through Q2)
   • Software Development KPI Dashboard – https://www.notion.so/Software-Development-KPIs (targets vs. actuals, sprint velocity, defect density, deployment frequency, etc.)
   • Digital Marketing KPI Dashboard – https://www.notion.so/Digital-Marketing-KPIs (lead-gen, campaign ROI, MQL→SQL conversion, organic traffic, etc.)
   Each page includes a brief "Notable Trends" call-out section to highlight significant movements quarter-over-quarter.

2. Budget Utilisation & Remaining Spend (live tracker)
   Google Drive workbook: Department_Budget_Tracker_Q2-FY25 (separate tabs for each team)
   • Software Development – 68 % of FY budget spent ($1.70 M of $2.50 M). Committed but not yet posted: $240 K (tooling licences + contractor extensions). Remaining discretionary: ~$560 K.
   • Digital Marketing – 55 % of FY budget spent ($660 K of $1.20 M). Committed but not yet posted: $75 K (Q3 ad inventory). Remaining discretionary: ~$465 K.
   The sheet auto-updates nightly from NetSuite, so figures will stay fresh.

3. HR-related Notes Influencing Staffing/Budget Forecasts
   • Software Development –
     – Approved to open 2 additional FTEs in August (mid-level backend engineer & SDET).
     – One senior engineer flagged as medium attrition risk; retention plan underway.
   • Digital Marketing –
     – Content Strategist has given notice (last day 26 July). Replacement requisition approved and in recruiting pipeline.
     – No other planned head-count changes.

Everything should be ready for you to slice into the consolidated brief. If you need any exports (PDF/CSV) or further drill-downs, just let me know and I can send them right over.

Let me know if you, Mark, or Sarah would like a quick walkthrough—happy to hop on a call.

Best,
Jane
