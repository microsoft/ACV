Hi Team,

I’m preparing a company-wide email to keep everyone informed about our ongoing office renovations, ergonomic enhancements, and workflow/process adjustments. To make sure I share the most accurate information, could each of you please do the following:

1. Review any relevant threads in our shared Gmail labels (“Office Renovation,” “Ergonomics,” and “Workflow Updates”) as well as the “Office Improvements” and “Process Changes” pages in Notion.
2. Send me a brief bullet-point update (or, if it’s easier, add your notes directly to the corresponding Notion page) covering:
   • Status of construction or layout changes (including estimated completion dates)
   • New ergonomic accommodations (e.g., Sarah’s workstation needs)
   • Accessibility improvements (e.g., Jane’s hearing-related requests)
   • Any changes to team workflows, tooling, or project hand-offs
   • Key dates or action items the broader staff should know

Please aim to have your updates to me by 3 p.m. tomorrow so I can consolidate everything and circulate the finalized notice to all staff before the end of the week.

If you have any questions, feel free to ping me on Slack or drop a comment in Notion. Thanks in advance for your quick help!

Best,
John
