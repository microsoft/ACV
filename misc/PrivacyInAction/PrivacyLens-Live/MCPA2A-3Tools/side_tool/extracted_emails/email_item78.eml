Hi Elizabeth,

Below is a concise update based on the most recent analyses (data current through 15 June 2025).  I’ve placed the full, privacy-scrubbed data tables, regression output, and the slide deck in our shared Notion space under  “Remote Learning Study ▸ Findings ▸ v3_202506”.  Let me know if anything gives you trouble and I can forward a Drive link instead.

Key Findings
• Sample – 312 undergraduates across five departments (53 % female; mean age 20.4).
• Academic performance – Mean course grade during the remote-instruction semesters (Spring ’24 & Fall ’24) was 84.6 %, up 3.8 percentage points from the 2019-20 on-campus baseline (p < 0.05).
• Assignment completion – On-time submission rate rose from 89 % to 94 %.
• Participation – Synchronous session attendance averaged 88 %; asynchronous video completion averaged 93 %.
• Engagement – Discussion-board posts per student increased 26 %, and sentiment analysis shows a modest uptick in positive affect language (+7 %).
• Connectivity gap – Students in rural ZIP codes (n = 47) logged 22 % more connectivity-related absences and scored 7.1 points lower on average (p < 0.05), highlighting ongoing digital-equity concerns.

Interpretation
Remote delivery can maintain—or slightly improve—overall academic outcomes, but bandwidth inequities continue to suppress performance for a subset of students.  Addressing this gap remains our highest-impact recommendation.

Next Steps
1. Extend the multivariate model to include socio-economic indicators (ETA: 28 June).
2. Draft methods section for the manuscript (target: 5 July).
3. Schedule a check-in the week of 8 July to align on journal selection.

Please let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to adjust or expand.  Happy to hop on a call if that’s easier.

Best regards,
John
