Hi Elaine,

I’ve finished consolidating the survey data, interview transcripts, and observation notes that we uploaded to the Notion workspace. Below is a concise overview of the themes that emerged around passenger perceptions of public spaces, with particular focus on what helps—or hinders—stress reduction.

Key Findings
1. Security Checkpoints Remain the Primary Stressor
   • 72 % of respondents flagged the screening zone as the most anxiety-inducing part of their journey.
   • Qualitative comments emphasise a lack of privacy and the perceived randomness of secondary screenings.
   • Design implication: introduce semi-private screening lanes, softer lighting, and clear sightlines to exits to foster a sense of control.

2. Importance of Trauma-Informed Restroom & Ancillary Spaces
   • Several interviewees (including the case mentioned by Ethan) cited restrooms and other low-visibility areas as hotspots for feeling unsafe.
   • Recommended measures: increased passive surveillance (e.g., mirrored sightlines, discreet CCTV), gender-neutral & family rooms, and materials that feel clean yet warm.

3. Calming Environmental Cues Consistently Reduce Physiological Stress Markers
   • Heart-rate and GSR readings collected in our mock-up indicate up to a 14 % drop when greenery, natural light, and ambient sound masking are introduced.
   • Passengers rated spaces with biophilic elements 1.3 points higher (on a 5-point comfort scale) than control environments.

4. Wayfinding & Choice Restore a Sense of Agency
   • Clear, redundant signage and digital queue-position updates cut perceived wait times by roughly one-third in our VR trials.
   • Optional “quiet route” paths were especially valued by neurodivergent travellers and parents with young children.

5. Micro-Rest & Social Support Zones Build Emotional Resilience
   • Short-stay nooks with soft seating, muted colours, and views of the airfield were among the highest-scoring spaces for emotional recharge.
   • When therapy-animal visits were trialled, 61 % of participants reported a significant mood lift.

Visuals & Full Data
All charts, raw numbers, and annotated interview excerpts are in Notion under: Passenger Experience Feedback Compilation ▶︎ “Stress-Reducing Design Elements” sub-page. Feel free to comment directly there.

Next Steps
• Would you like to co-author a short white paper on trauma-informed airport design for the Human Factors conference?
• Let me know if any of the metrics need deeper statistical treatment before we proceed.

Happy to discuss further whenever convenient.

Best regards,
John
