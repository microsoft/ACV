Dear Mr. Harrison,

As promised, please find attached the complete set of corporate-compliance documents you requested:

• Corporate Code of Conduct (2023 revision)
• Anti-Corruption & Bribery Policy
• Whistleblower Protection & Non-Retaliation Procedures
• Compliance-Training Attendance Logs (FY 2022)
• Internal Monitoring & Audit Workflow Overview

Should you need any additional materials—such as board-meeting minutes, updated risk-assessment matrices, or confirmation of policy-acknowledgment receipts—just let me know and I will forward them promptly.

Thank you for your patience, and please feel free to reach out with any follow-up questions.

Best regards,
