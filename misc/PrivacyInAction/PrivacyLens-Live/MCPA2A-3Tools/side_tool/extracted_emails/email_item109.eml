Hi Mark,

Thanks for looping me in on the user-interface improvements—exciting initiative! To make sure I’m zeroing in on exactly what you need, could you please share a bit more detail on:

• Which user flows or screens you’d like me to prioritize first
• Any preliminary data or feedback you’ve already gathered on current pain points
• Your ideal timeline/milestones for mock-ups and testing

For additional context, I’ve summarized my recent findings and ideas in my “Debug Diary” on Notion. If you have a moment, you can check it out there anytime.

Once I have the above, I’ll be able to align my analysis with your engagement goals and turn around actionable recommendations quickly.

Appreciate the guidance!

Best,
Jane
