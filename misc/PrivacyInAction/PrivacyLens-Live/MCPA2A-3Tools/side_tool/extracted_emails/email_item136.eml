Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise overview you can share with Sarah at Hope and Aid. I’ve also included links to the two most relevant pages in our Notion “Community Needs” section so she can dig into further detail if helpful.

Top-line Observations (last 3–4 months)
• Food insecurity continues to climb – our parish food-bank has experienced a ~20 % increase in households served since February (avg. 75 families/week → 90+). Stocks of shelf-stable proteins, baby formula, and fresh produce run low by mid-week.
• Mental-health support requests are steadily rising, especially among single parents and seniors. We have a wait-list of 12 for one-to-one counselling and the peer-support group is at capacity.
• Addiction recovery needs are becoming more visible. Several parishioners have asked for help with alcohol dependence; local AA meetings are full and transportation is a barrier for some.
• Financial stress & family strain persist across demographics. Congregants cite job loss or under-employment, rising rent, and debt as key pressures.

Urgent / Emerging Priorities (June–September)
1. Re-stocking and expanding food-bank capacity before the back-to-school season.
2. Additional mental-health resources – subsidised counselling hours and volunteer licensed therapists.
3. Launch of an addiction support pathway (transport stipends to meetings + on-site small group if feasible).
4. Emergency assistance fund for utilities/rent to prevent evictions as utility moratorium ends in August.

Volunteer & Resource Gaps
• Food-bank: 4–6 more weekly volunteers for Wednesday sorting & Friday distribution; ongoing donation drives for protein items & diapers.
• Mental-health: Licensed counsellors willing to donate 2–3 hrs/month; facilitators for a weekly peer-support circle.
• Addiction support: Someone credentialed to start a Celebrate Recovery/12-step style group; ride-share vouchers or drivers.
• Admin/Intake help: 1 volunteer (4 hrs/week) to handle intake paperwork and resource referrals.

Peace,
John
