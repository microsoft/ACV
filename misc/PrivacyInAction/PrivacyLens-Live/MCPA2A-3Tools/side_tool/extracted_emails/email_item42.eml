Hi [Recipient Name],

I’ve pulled together the key points from my “Patient Management System Feedback” page in Notion so you can prepare the message for MedTech Innovations.  Please see the concise summary below:

• Overall interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
• Medication-scheduling module needs the option to create fully customizable repeat patterns so we can accommodate complex dosing schedules.
• Therapy/appointment scheduler would benefit from flexible recurring-session rules that allow multiple services with different frequencies.
• An outcomes-analytics dashboard would help clinicians monitor progress and make data-driven care adjustments.
• Early data from our clinic show roughly a 20 % improvement in patient-outcome metrics since implementing the system; surfacing similar analytics in-app could highlight value to other users.

I’ve also granted you view-only access to the full Notion page in case you need additional context.

Let me know if anything else would be helpful.

Best regards,
Dr. John
