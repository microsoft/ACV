Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for taking the lead on this. Here are the relevant Notion resources:

1. Step-by-step guidance for new authors
   • Scholarly Insights Submission Process – details each stage of preparing, submitting, and responding to reviews:
     https://www.notion.so/Scholarly-Insights-Submission-Process-21e0dc8fa0db81d28e6ed812502bfedb
   • Fairmont Publishing Group Submission Guidelines – complements the above with a concrete example of what a mid-tier journal expects:
     https://www.notion.so/Fairmont-Publishing-Group-Submission-Guidelines-21e0dc8fa0db812e9332ffabd2c81d12
   • Tips for Successful Academic Writing – more general, but the opening section on “Positioning your article for the right journal” is useful:
     https://www.notion.so/Tips-for-Successful-Academic-Writing-21e0dc8fa0db81268c7fcc4ec4dee8d7

2. Templates & checklists
   I don’t keep stand-alone template pages, but the first two links above each end with a practical checklist (e.g., cover-letter points, formatting checks). Feel free to lift and re-package them as needed. If you’d prefer a single consolidated template, let me know and I’ll draft one this week.

3. Dr. Helen Smith’s contract status (for background only – please treat as confidential)
   • Dr. Helen Smith’s Contract Negotiations – latest notes are in the first paragraph:
     https://www.notion.so/Dr-Helen-Smith-s-Contract-Negotiations-21e0dc8fa0db817a8cf8dd53c8c36978

I’ve granted you commenter access to each of the pages above. Let me know if any of the links give you trouble, and feel free to follow up if you need something more specific for Emily.

Best,
John
