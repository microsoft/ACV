Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for pulling this together. I’ve consolidated everything you’ll need into a single Notion folder called “Blackwood Outreach – Reference Pack.” You should now have access.

Inside you’ll find:

1. Investment Focus & Performance Highlights
   • Snapshot of our AUM growth (CAGR 18% over the past 4 yrs)
   • Sector allocation heat-map (45% mid-market tech, 30% sustainable infra, 25% special situations)
   • Fund III gross IRR 29% / net IRR 23% with top-quartile PME benchmark.

2. Co-Investment & Partnership Structures
   • Overview of our typical minority co-sponsor model (up to 20% GP commit, board observer rights, recycled carry option)
   • Illustrative waterfall and fee share examples.

3. Recent Success Stories / Case Studies
   • Aurora Grid (2.7x MOIC in 28 months)
   • Clarion HealthTech carve-out (1.9x MOIC to date; on track for IPO 2026)
   • Jupiter Renewables recap with Mr. Blackwood’s family office as reference LP.

4. Key Talking Points & KPIs
   • Why now: pipeline of six proprietary deals >$350 M EV each
   • Differentiator: <12-month average holding period to operational break-even
   • ESG overlay – Scope-3 reduction avg 34% across portfolio
   • Suggested CTA: invite Harrison to review data room for Deal “Project Summit” and set up diligence call week of Aug 19.

5. Proposed Timeline / Next Steps
   • 7/29 – Send intro email & teaser deck
   • 8/05 – 8/09 – NDA + data room access
   • 8/19 – Management & IC call
   • 9/02 – Term-sheet target

If you need anything refined or additional metrics, just let me know and I can drop them into the pack.

Thanks again!

Best,
Jane
