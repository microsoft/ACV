Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise rundown of what I’m seeing day-to-day at Harmony Health Clinic. I’ve cross-checked these notes with the "MedTech – profile management follow-up" thread and my “Jane’s Observations” page in Notion so everything should align with what we’ve discussed previously.

1. Data-Entry Workflows
• Auto-capture from insurance card scanning continues to save time and cut keystroke errors—great improvement.
• ICD-10 pick-list is still very long; filtering by patient age or recently-used codes would speed up searches.
• The behavioural-therapy template doesn’t surface co-morbid conditions (e.g., epilepsy) unless you open an additional tab—easy to miss.

2. Privacy & Access Controls
• Role-based permissions are solid; front-desk staff can’t see progress-note narratives, which is essential.
• However, clinicians can’t self-audit who has viewed a chart—only admins can pull audit logs. A “recent viewers” button would boost transparency.
• Masked mode for screens facing the waiting room times out after two minutes of inactivity; would prefer 60-second auto-blur to prevent shoulder surfing.

3. Pain-Points / Risk Areas
• Duplicate profiles are still created when new families pre-register online—no automatic merge or warning that an MRN already exists.
• Guardian/POA status must be updated in four separate places (demographics, consent form, billing contact, emergency contact). A single authoritative field that propagates across the record would help.
• Batch export of de-identified data for research requires manual column removal each time; a preset “safe export” profile would streamline compliance.

4. Quick Wins / Wishlist
• Inline consent-status indicator (traffic-light icon) at the top of every chart.
• Smart text for frequently-used autism-specific assessment phrases.
• Ability to schedule an automatic reminder for annual HIPAA acknowledgment.

Happy to elaborate or hop on a quick call if that’s easier. Let me know what works best.

Thanks again for involving frontline clinicians in the feedback loop—much appreciated!

Warm regards,
