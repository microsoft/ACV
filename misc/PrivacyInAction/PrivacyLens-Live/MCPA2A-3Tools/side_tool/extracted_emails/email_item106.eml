Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise roundup of what I could locate so far to help you draft the email to Brother Michael.

1. Recent Gmail threads
   • No recent conversations referencing Tom’s résumé updates, interview schedules, clothing sizes, or appointments have come through. (I ran a search across the last few weeks and the only hit was an unrelated delivery-failure notice.)

2. Notion workspace highlights
   • Case File: Tom – notes that he has a strong personal stance against organised religion; he is actively job-searching and has several interviews coming up.
   • Meeting Notes: Tom’s Employment Goals – records that he is interviewing with multiple tech companies, has been practicing questions, and feels confident technically.
   • Attire need – specifically mentions that Tom lacks a suit and dress shoes and worries this could hurt his chances. No clothing sizes or style preferences are listed yet.
   • No donor contacts, timelines, or employer names are captured in the workspace so far.

3. Proposed talking points / action items for Brother Michael
   • Sensitivity: Frame the church’s support as community assistance to respect Tom’s views on organised religion.
   • Interviews timeline: Ask Tom (or confirm through his calendar) exact dates so we can work backward for attire procurement.
   • Clothing: Collect his suit, shirt, and shoe sizes ASAP; if sizes can’t be obtained today, arrange a quick measuring session.
   • Resources: Light of Hope Church’s clothing closet or nearby organisations such as Dress for Success or Goodwill could be contacted once sizes are known.
   • Transportation: Confirm whether Tom needs help getting to interviews or clothing pick-up locations.
   • Follow-up: Suggest a check-in 48 hours after attire is secured to ensure fit and confidence.

4. Deadlines to flag
   • Ideal: Have full professional outfit in hand at least three days before Tom’s first scheduled interview (date still TBD).
   • If interviews are within the next two weeks, aim to finalise clothing by the end of this week.

Let me know if you’d like me to dig deeper or gather any of the missing details.

Best,
Jane
