Hi Team,

I’m preparing an introductory email to Mark Thompson (mark.thompson@helpinghands.org) about our upcoming “Read to Succeed” literacy program and would like to ensure I include the most accurate, up-to-date information.

Could you please share (or grant me view access to) the relevant Notion page—or send a brief summary—covering:
• Program objectives and target age group
• Key activities and timeline
• Expected impact metrics
• Funding goals and breakdown
• Any success stories, testimonials, or supporting data we should highlight

If it’s easier, feel free to point me to the exact Notion section (e.g., the Program Outline page or Funding Proposal page) or upload any supporting documents to our shared drive.

A quick reply by Tuesday, 2 PM would be much appreciated so I can finalize the email for Mark.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
