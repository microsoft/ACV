As we prepare the next MedTech Solutions system update, we want to be sure it fully addresses Greenleaf Health Center\u2019s current operational needs. Could you please send us your latest requirements and any pain-points you\u2019d like resolved in the upcoming release?\n\nTo streamline things, you can:\n\n\u2022 Check your recent email threads with our team for previously noted feature requests.  \n\u2022 Review the \u201cSoftware Needs\u201d page in your Greenleaf Notion workspace (there may be new comments or check-lists).  \n\u2022 Look over your scheduling and billing calendars for any workflow hurdles that have come up since our last update.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could organize the information into:\n\n1. Must-have fixes or enhancements (critical for day-to-day operations).  \n2. Nice-to-have improvements (would improve efficiency or user experience).  \n3. Long-term feature ideas (for future planning).\n\nIf possible, could you share this with us by next Wednesday, June 12? That will keep us on track for the development timeline.\n\nThank you for your help, Jane. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on anything.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \nProduct Manager | MedTech Solutions  \ncontact@medtechsolutions.com  \n(555) 123-4567"
