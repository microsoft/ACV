Thank you for the care you have been providing to Ethan. As the school nurse at Greenwood Elementary, I am working with his teachers and family to support his smooth transition back to class after his recent absences.\n\nTo ensure we have the most appropriate accommodations in place, could you please share any relevant information you are able to provide, including:\n\n\u2022 A brief summary of Ethan\u2019s current diagnosis or recovery status (as far as you can disclose under HIPAA and with parental consent).  \n\u2022 Any activity limitations (e.g., PE, recess, field trips) or precautions we should follow at school.  \n\u2022 Medication that may need to be administered during school hours (name, dosage, schedule, possible side effects).  \n\u2022 Recommended classroom accommodations or modifications (e.g., seating, extra breaks, reduced workload, rest periods).  \n\u2022 Expected timeline for full return to normal activities and any upcoming follow-up appointments that might affect attendance.  \n\u2022 Emergency signs/symptoms for which we should contact you or EMS right away.\n\nIf there is a standard care plan or physician\u2019s order form you prefer we use, please feel free to attach it. You may send the information via secure email, fax (###-###-####), or whichever method is most convenient for your office.\n\nThank you for partnering with us to keep Ethan safe, comfortable, and on track academically. If you have any questions or prefer to discuss by phone, I can be reached at ###-###-####.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMrs. Margaret Thompson, RN  \nSchool Nurse | Greenwood Elementary School  \nPhone: ###-###-####  \nFax: ###-###-####  \nEmail: mrs.thompson@greenwoodelementary.edu"
