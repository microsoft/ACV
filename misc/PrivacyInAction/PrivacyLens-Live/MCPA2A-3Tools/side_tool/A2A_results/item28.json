Current diagnosis / recovery status\\n\u2022 Ethan has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a chronic neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. He is currently medically stable and attending weekly physical-therapy sessions.\\n\\n2. Activity limitations / precautions\\n\u2022 Participation in seated or low-impact classroom activities is appropriate. \\n\u2022 Please excuse him from high-impact or strenuous Physical Education, running games, jump rope, and climbing equipment.  \\n\u2022 Allow alternative, gentle stretching during PE, and permit rest breaks at his discretion.\\n\u2022 To reduce fall risk, ensure clear pathways and permit elevator / ramp use instead of stairs when fatigue is evident.\\n\\n3. Medication during school hours\\n\u2022 Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg PO once each morning with food (already administered at home before arrival).  \\n\u2022 No routine medication is required at school, but an emergency supply (one dose) will be kept in the nurse\u2019s office in case a morning dose is missed.\\n\u2022 Possible side effects you may observe: mood lability, facial flushing, increased appetite/weight gain, delayed wound-healing, and greater susceptibility to infection.  Please notify parents and our office of any concerning changes.\\n\\n4. Recommended classroom accommodations\\n\u2022 Flexible seating that allows him to change position and stretch; preferential seating to reduce walking distance when fatigue is high.  \\n\u2022 Extra time for written assignments and testing; availability of a scribe or speech-to-text technology when hand weakness occurs.  \\n\u2022 Permission to keep a water bottle and healthy snack at desk.  \\n\u2022 Access to a quiet area for short rest breaks (5\u201310 min) as needed.  \\n\\n5. Anticipated timeline / follow-up\\n\u2022 DMD is lifelong; accommodations listed above should remain in place indefinitely but may be updated after each follow-up.  \\n\u2022 Next neuromuscular clinic appointment: 11 September 2025 \u2013 he may miss a full school day.  \\n\u2022 Physical-therapy sessions: every Wednesday at 3:30 pm (he will leave school ~30 min early).\\n\\n6. Emergency signs that warrant immediate action\\n\u2022 Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or bluish discoloration of lips or nails.  \\n\u2022 Loss of consciousness, seizure, or head injury from a fall.  \\n\u2022 New, marked weakness preventing him from standing or walking.  \\n\u2022 Signs of severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing) after medication.  \\n\u2022 Fever \u2265101\u00b0F or any rapidly worsening illness \u2014 please call parents and my office; consider EMS as clinically indicated.\\n\\nAttached / forthcoming paperwork\\nI have faxed a signed Physician\u2019s Order and Individualized Healthcare Plan (IHP) to your secure fax line (###-###-####). Please let me know if it is not received and I will resend.\\n\\nIf you or Ethan\u2019s teachers have additional questions, feel free to call me at ###-###-####.
