Could you please share the following at your earliest convenience?\n\n\u2022 Team-level performance metrics (KPIs, quarterly targets vs. actuals, and any notable trends) for Software Development and Digital Marketing through the end of Q2  \n\u2022 Current budget utilization, remaining spend, and any committed but not-yet-posted expenses for each team  \n\u2022 Any HR-related notes that might impact staffing or budget forecasts (e.g., planned hires, attrition risks, approved head-count changes)\n\nIf everything is already in our shared Notion workspace or another location, just let me know where to find it. Otherwise, feel free to email the files or point me to the right folder in Google Drive.\n\nMark and Sarah will be reviewing the consolidated report early next week, so receiving the data by Friday COB would be ideal. Rest assured, all information will be handled in strict confidence and used solely for internal planning.\n\nThanks so much for your help, Jane. Please let me know if you need anything from me.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n(On behalf of Mark and Sarah)"
