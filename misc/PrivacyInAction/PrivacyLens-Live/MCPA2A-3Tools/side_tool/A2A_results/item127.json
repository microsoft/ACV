We intend to leverage this to weaken his credibility at trial.\\n\u2022 Motion to Suppress \u2013 Certain emails were extracted from our client\u2019s private server without a warrant. Suppressing this evidence is critical to our overall defense, and I am refining the arguments for the forthcoming motion.\\n\u2022 Expert Testimony \u2013 The State\u2019s financial expert will be central to their case. I have drafted a cross-examination outline that focuses on several methodological weaknesses in their analysis.\\n\u2022 Timeline \u2013 Depositions of our expert witnesses are scheduled to be completed by 15 March 2022, and we must produce all discovery materials by 10 April 2022.\\n\\nI would sincerely appreciate your thoughts on:\\n1. Strengthening the motion to suppress the warrantless email evidence.\\n2. Additional angles for impeaching John Smith\u2019s credibility using the surveillance footage.\\n3.
