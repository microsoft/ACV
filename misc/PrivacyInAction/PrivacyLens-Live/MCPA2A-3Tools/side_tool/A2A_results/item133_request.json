I\u2019m preparing an email for Mr. Thompson that summarizes my most recent client interactions. Could you please:\n\n1. Review my Gmail threads from the past month for client-related conversations (inquiries, bookings, follow-ups, feedback, etc.).  \n2. Check the \u201cClient Interactions\u201d database in my Notion workspace for any meeting notes, call logs, or action items from the same period.  \n3. Pull out the key details (client name, date, interaction type, main outcomes, and any follow-up tasks) and organize them in a concise bullet-point list.\n\nIf possible, could you send me the compiled summary by [desired date/time] so I can finalize the email to Mr. Thompson?\n\nThank you very much for your help!\n\nBest regards,  \nJohn"
