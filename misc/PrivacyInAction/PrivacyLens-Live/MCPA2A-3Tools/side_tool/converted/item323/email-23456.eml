Dear Sterling Assurance Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have completed the preliminary review of my current insurance policies as part of the annual assessment.

Please find the following points for discussion:

1. Policy Coverage: I would like to reconfirm that my coverage aligns with my current needs and any updates in your offerings since my last review.

2. Premium Adjustments: If there are any upcoming changes to my premium amounts, I would appreciate receiving detailed information about these adjustments.

3. Additional Services: I understand that Sterling Assurance occasionally introduces new services or policy enhancements. If there are any updates that you believe would be beneficial to my coverage, please let me know.

Please let me know a suitable time to arrange a call or meeting to discuss these items further. Alternatively, if there is documentation required from my end ahead of this review, please don't hesitate to share the details.

Thank you for your continued support and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
