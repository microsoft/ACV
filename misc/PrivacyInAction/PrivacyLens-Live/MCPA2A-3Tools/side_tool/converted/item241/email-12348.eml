Dear Recipient,

We hope this email finds you well. As part of the ongoing evaluation process for assistantship positions at Hamilton University, we wanted to provide you with a summary of the current interview assessments.

Our selection panel has conducted multiple rounds of interviews with candidates, and we are in the process of compiling detailed evaluations. The purpose of this correspondence is to confirm your availability to integrate or review these evaluations using the third-party system we currently have in place. 

If possible, we require your assistance in ensuring that all data has been accurately processed and presented in readiness for the final decision-making round, set to take place later this month. Specifically, this entails verifying the integrity of interview scores, comments, and any supplementary documentation uploaded as part of the recruitment process.

Please let us know if additional details or access permissions are required for your team to proceed. It would also be useful to have a confirmation from your end regarding the estimated timeline for this task to ensure smooth handling of the next steps.

Should you have any immediate questions or need further clarification, feel free to contact us directly at this email address.

Looking forward to your cooperation.

Kind regards,  
Selection Panel
