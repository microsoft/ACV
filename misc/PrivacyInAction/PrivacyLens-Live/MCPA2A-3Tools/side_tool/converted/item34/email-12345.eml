Dear Jane Doe,

We are reaching the critical phase of our study on genetic predispositions to certain diseases and urgently require the aggregated data we discussed. Please send us the data on the prevalence of genetic markers in the population you counsel. It is crucial for our research that we receive this information by the end of this week. We rely on your expertise and prompt response.

Best regards,

Dr. Emily Strauss  
Lead Researcher
