Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

Thank you for sharing the details and timeline regarding the software development milestones for the ongoing project. I have reviewed the information, and everything appears to be on track so far. It's great to see the progress made toward achieving our goals.

I just wanted to confirm a couple of points regarding the next phases of development:

1. Could you provide more clarity on the expected completion date for Milestone 3? This will help us align our internal review processes and ensure timely feedback.
2. Is there any additional documentation or resources that the development team might need from our end to ensure smooth progress?

Please let me know if there’s a convenient time for a brief call next week to discuss these aspects further. I want to ensure we’re perfectly synchronized as we approach these critical stages of the project.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
