Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the material estimates for the Grandview Bridge project. I’ve reviewed the specifications and compiled the requested information.

Based on the details you provided, the primary materials needed are as follows:

- **Reinforced Concrete**: 250 cubic meters  
- **Structural Steel**: 80 tons  
- **Precast Concrete Slabs**: 120 units (2m x 0.5m size each)  

The total cost estimate for these materials is $76,500. Additionally, please let me know if you would like us to include delivery costs or if you will handle transportation independently.

If there are any design modifications or adjustments to the quantities needed, feel free to contact me, and I’ll revise the estimates accordingly. Our team is ready to assist with any technical queries you may have during the procurement process.

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can proceed further.

Best regards,
