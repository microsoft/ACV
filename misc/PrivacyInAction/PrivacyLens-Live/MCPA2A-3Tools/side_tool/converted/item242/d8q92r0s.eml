Hi Maria,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the New Year Marketing Strategy in your previous email. I’ve taken some time to review your suggestions, and I must say, your approach seems well-rounded and innovative. 

I particularly appreciated your focus on leveraging social media channels to engage with younger audiences. I think this could be a game-changer for our campaigns in 2022. To build on this, I’d love to brainstorm some specific ideas for content themes that resonate with that demographic. Perhaps we could schedule a call later this week to dive deeper into this?

Also, I wanted to quickly touch upon the budget allocation for this strategy. Could you provide a bit more detail on the projected costs for the influencer partnerships you mentioned, as well as the targeted ad campaigns?

Looking forward to collaborating further and turning these ideas into actionable plans.

Thanks again for your hard work on this!

Best regards,  
John Doe
