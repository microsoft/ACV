    "text": "Jane, your client (Tom Wang) mentioned to me after yesterday's meeting that he's reeling from a significant financial blow - his tech stock portfolio plummeted, resulting in a $500,000 loss overnight, primarily due to the unexpected collapse of a major player in the industry. Have you caught wind of this? Given Tom's status as a high-priority client and the magnitude of this loss, it's crucial we touch base with him as soon as possible to reassess his financial strategy and provide the support he needs to navigate this setback.",
