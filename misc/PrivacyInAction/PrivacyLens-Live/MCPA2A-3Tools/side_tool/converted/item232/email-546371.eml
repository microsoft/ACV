Hi Jane,

Thanks for your insights on the Q2 projections. I've incorporated your feedback and attached the revised document. Please review it at your earliest convenience. Also, I wanted to briefly discuss the implications of the new tax legislation on our investment strategies during our next meeting.

Best,
