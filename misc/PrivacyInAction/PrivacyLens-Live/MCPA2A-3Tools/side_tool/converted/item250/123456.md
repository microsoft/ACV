# Case #764 - Councilman Gregory

Investigation into the recent string of burglaries has led to a surprising potential suspect: Councilman Gregory. While there is no direct evidence linking him to the crimes, several pieces of circumstantial evidence have raised suspicions. His proximity to the crime scenes and the discovery of a unique watch near one of the burglarized homes, similar to the one he is known to wear, have made him a person of interest. Further surveillance and investigation are required to determine his involvement.
