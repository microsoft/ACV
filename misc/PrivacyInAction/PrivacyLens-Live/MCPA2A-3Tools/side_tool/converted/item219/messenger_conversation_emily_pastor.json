    "text": "Jane, the weight of my new role is becoming more challenging than I anticipated. The influx of tasks and the expectation to manage new team members effectively is taking its toll, especially when I'm not at my best emotionally. To add to my struggles, I've recently gone through a breakup with Alex, which has left me feeling even more vulnerable and less like myself. I'm reaching out because I could really use your guidance and support. Could we possibly have a chat tomorrow? Your advice would mean a lot to me during this difficult time.",
