# Coping Strategies for Privacy Recovery

It's essential to establish a sense of safety and normalcy after a privacy violation. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. Recognize that your feelings are valid and that recovery is a personal journey.  
2. Engage with a support network, whether it's friends, family, or a dedicated support group.  
3. Consider professional help, such as counseling or therapy, to work through complex emotions.  
4. Develop a routine that includes activities you enjoy and that give you a sense of accomplishment.  
5. Stay informed about privacy rights and tools that can help protect your personal information in the future.
