Dear Carlos,

I hope this email finds you well. As discussed, I am sending over the materials for the Financial Literacy Workshop that we will be hosting in the coming weeks. These resources have been designed to provide valuable insights and tools for individuals looking to enhance their financial well-being.

The materials include:
1. A comprehensive participant workbook covering foundational financial topics.
2. PowerPoint slides for the workshop presentation.
3. A set of case studies and practical exercises for group activities.
4. Links to additional online resources and tools for continued learning.

Please review the attached documents and let me know if there are any adjustments or additional resources you'd like me to include before the workshop. I want to ensure that everything is tailored to the needs of your community participants.

Looking forward to your feedback. Thank you for collaborating on this meaningful initiative to help empower the community!

Best regards,
