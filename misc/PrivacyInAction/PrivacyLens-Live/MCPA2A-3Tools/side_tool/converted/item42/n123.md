# Project Feedback

Alex  
Alex's project demonstrates a solid understanding of the course material, and the data analysis he conducted is well-executed. The presentation of his findings is clear, and his use of visualizations helps support his argument. However, I felt his hypothesis could have been stated more concisely to really sharpen the focus of his paper.

Overall, I've assigned Alex's project a grade of B+. This reflects the strengths in his work, but also the need to work on tightening up his hypothesis and research question.

Emily  
Emily's project was one of the strongest in the class. She demonstrated an excellent grasp of the theoretical concepts, and her data analysis was incredibly thorough. Her hypothesis was very clearly stated, and her argument was logically structured. I awarded Emily's project an A.

James  
James' project showed promise, but suffered from some gaps in the analysis and a lack of clarity in his writing. While he covered the key requirements, I felt his project could have benefited from more time spent on revising and polishing the final draft. James received a B.

Sarah  
Sarah's project was well-researched and covered all the necessary elements. However, I felt her analysis could have gone into greater depth in certain areas. Her overall argument was coherent, but lacked some of the sophistication I was hoping to see. Sarah's project received a B-.
