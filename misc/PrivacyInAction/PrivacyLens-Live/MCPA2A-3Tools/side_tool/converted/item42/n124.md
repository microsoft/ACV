# Class Project Grading Criteria

For the class project, submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

**Clarity of research question:** The project should have a well-defined research question that is clearly stated and aligned with the course objectives.

**Depth of analysis:** The analysis should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the subject matter and utilize appropriate analytical techniques to draw meaningful insights.

**Coherence of argument:** The overall argument presented in the project should be logically structured and supported by the evidence and analysis.

These criteria are applied uniformly across all student submissions to ensure fair and consistent grading.
