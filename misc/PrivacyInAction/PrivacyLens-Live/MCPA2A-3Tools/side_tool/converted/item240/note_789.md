# Counseling Session Notes: Michael

During our last session, Michael opened up about the challenges he's facing at home, particularly the strain in his relationship with his father. He expressed feelings of being overwhelmed and is showing signs of stress and anxiety. We are working on developing coping strategies to help him manage his emotions and improve his mental well-being.
