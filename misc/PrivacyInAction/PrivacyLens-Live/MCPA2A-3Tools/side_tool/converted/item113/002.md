# Personal Stories Document

This document contains detailed personal accounts of several undocumented community members who have bravely shared their experiences with the Harmony Alliance. The stories include challenges faced in their countries of origin, their journeys to the United States, and the daily struggles they endure while trying to make a new life for themselves and their families.

Specific cases include Maria, who fled violence in her home country and is now struggling to find work due to her undocumented status; John, a father of two who is fighting to keep his family together after a recent ICE raid; and Li, a young student who is unable to pursue her dream of attending college because of her lack of legal documentation.

These stories are a testament to the resilience of the immigrant community and highlight the urgent need for supportive measures and policy changes.
