Hi Mark,

Thank you for following up on the Resource Sharing Agreement. I really appreciate the time and effort you've taken to review the details.

Regarding the terms outlined in the previous draft, I noticed a couple of sections where we could make some minor adjustments to ensure mutual benefit. For example, the proposed timeline in Section 4 might need to be extended by two weeks to accommodate the procurement process on our end. Let me know if that works for you or if there's a better approach.

Additionally, could you confirm whether the listed hardware resources in Appendix B are still accurate? If there have been any changes, I’d be happy to coordinate an update to the agreement.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Once we finalize these details, I believe we’ll be in a good position to move forward.

Best regards,
