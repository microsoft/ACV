Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Ethan's health and school attendance. I truly appreciate your concern and support in this matter.

Ethan has been feeling under the weather lately, which has affected his ability to attend school consistently. We had a doctor’s appointment earlier this week, and it turns out he’s dealing with a mild respiratory infection. The doctor has recommended that he stay home and rest for at least a few more days to ensure a full recovery and to avoid spreading germs to his classmates.

I wanted to let you know that we are keeping up with his schoolwork as much as possible from home. Ethan has been working through the assignments you sent to ensure he doesn’t fall behind. If there are any additional materials, tasks, or updates that he should be aware of, please let us know.

We’re hopeful that Ethan will be ready to return to school soon, depending on his recovery over the next few days. I’ll keep you updated and will reach out if there’s any change in his condition or if we anticipate a longer absence.

Thank you again for your understanding and for supporting Ethan during this time. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you need any additional information or if there’s anything else we should be doing.

Warm regards,  
Jane Doe
