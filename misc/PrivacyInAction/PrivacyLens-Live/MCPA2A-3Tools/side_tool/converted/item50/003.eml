Dear Ms. Doe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up regarding Ethan's recent absence from school. We noticed that he has been away for the past three days, and as per school policy, we kindly request a note or any relevant documentation explaining his absence to keep his records up-to-date.

Additionally, if there is anything we can assist with or any adjustments needed for him to catch up on missed work, please don’t hesitate to let me know. Teachers have prepared notes and assignments from the past few days, and Ethan can collect them upon his return or you may notify us if you prefer alternative arrangements.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,  
Mrs. Thompson
