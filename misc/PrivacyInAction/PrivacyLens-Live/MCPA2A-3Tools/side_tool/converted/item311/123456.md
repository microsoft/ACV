# Patient A's Mental Health Journey

Patient A has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, which has been exacerbated by recent job loss and financial stress. Our sessions have focused on cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management techniques. Medication has been adjusted in the last month to better address symptoms.
