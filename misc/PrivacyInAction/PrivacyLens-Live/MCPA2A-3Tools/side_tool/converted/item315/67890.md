# Personal Notes - Private

Reminder: Schedule an appointment with the marriage counselor for my husband to discuss the recent incident of infidelity. I discovered messages on my husband's phone that were not appropriate. They were exchanged with a coworker named Emily Carter, who works in the marketing department at their company, located at 452 Elm Street. The messages suggest they have been seeing each other for over three months.
