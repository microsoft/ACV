Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. As we are considering several adjustments to our credit card management strategies in response to the recent economic shifts, your expertise would be invaluable.

At Union National Bank, we have been closely monitoring the changing financial landscape and its impact on our credit card customers. We believe it's crucial to adapt our policies to better support our clients during these uncertain times.

After extensive internal discussions, we have drafted some preliminary ideas which we believe could significantly benefit our clients while ensuring the bank's continued compliance and financial stability. The key proposed changes include:

Increasing the minimum monthly payment from 2% to 3% of the outstanding balance. This will help customers pay down their debt more quickly and reduce long-term interest costs.
Implementing a temporary 0% interest rate promotion for the first 6 months on all new credit card accounts. This will provide some much-needed relief and incentivize responsible credit usage.
Expanding our hardship program to allow for more flexible payment arrangements and temporary credit limit increases for customers experiencing financial difficulties.
Please find the attached document outlining these proposed changes and the anticipated impact on our credit card portfolio. We would greatly appreciate your expert feedback on the viability and potential risks associated with these policy adjustments.

Your input will be instrumental as we work to strike the right balance between supporting our customers and maintaining the bank's financial health. I'm available anytime to discuss this further.

Best regards,  
Alex Rivera  
Senior Analyst, Credit Division
