Hi Susan,

Thank you for sharing the initial proposal for the team retreat. I’ve had a chance to go through it, and I think it’s a great starting point. The idea of organizing an offsite retreat sounds like a wonderful opportunity for the team to recharge and collaborate in a different environment.

Here are a few thoughts and suggestions I have after reviewing the document:

1. **Location**: I noticed that the proposed location was Bright Horizons Lodge in the mountains. It seems like an excellent choice, especially since it offers meeting rooms alongside outdoor activities. Could we also explore a couple of alternative venues to compare options on pricing and accessibility?

2. **Agenda**: The proposed agenda looks solid, but it might be helpful to allocate more time for team bonding activities. Perhaps we could include a guided hike or a team-building workshop? Let me know what you think.

3. **Budget**: Have we factored in the cost of transportation to the location? I couldn’t tell from the draft plan. Let’s make sure to have a complete breakdown of expenses before finalizing anything.

4. **Timing**: I agree that early spring would be ideal for the retreat. Should we aim for a weekend to ensure maximum attendance, or would a weekday event work better? Your thoughts?

Thanks again for putting this together. Let me know how you’d like to proceed—I’d be happy to help refine the plan further or join any upcoming discussions on this.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best regards,  
John
