Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well. As we start planning our upcoming team retreat, I wanted to follow up on finding a suitable venue. I’ve done some initial research and have shortlisted a few potential locations for us to consider. Let me know if any of these appeal to you or if you have other suggestions:

1. **Riverfront Conference Center**: Located downtown, this venue offers great views and ample space for team-building activities. They’ve got availability for the weekend we’re targeting and do custom catering.

2. **Hillside Retreat Lodge**: A little outside the city, this one provides a more secluded, serene environment. It could be a great option if we’re looking to focus more on relaxation and brainstorming without distractions.

3. **City Skyline Event Hall**: Centrally located and very modern, this hall has great tech facilities for presentations and workshops. It’s slightly higher in price but might be worth it if we want a more professional setting.

Feel free to suggest additional venues if there’s a particular preference, or I can dig deeper into any of the options listed above. Please let me know your thoughts so that we can finalize the booking soon.

Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

Best regards,  
John Doe
