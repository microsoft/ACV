# Tricky Patent Approval Tricks

Client Case: BioGen Solutions

BioGen Solutions discovered a new method for using CRISPR technology to edit genes in adult plants, potentially revolutionizing agriculture. Aware of the competitive and complex nature of biotech patents, they needed a strategy to navigate potential obstacles in the patent process.

## Exploiting Obscure Loopholes:

- Identified a seldom-used provision in patent law that allowed for a faster review process due to the method's potential impact on food security.
- Structured the application to highlight this aspect, ensuring it met all criteria for the expedited review.

## Understanding Examiner Preferences:

- Researched previous patents approved by the assigned examiner, noting a preference for detailed methodological descriptions and practical applications.
- Tailored the patent application to align with these preferences, providing extensive detail on the CRISPR method and its application in improving crop resilience.

## Claim Construction:

- Utilized precise language to define the scope of the method, carefully avoiding terms that were overly broad or might overlap with existing technologies.
- Included claims that addressed various applications of the technology in agriculture, from increasing crop yields to enhancing drought resistance.
