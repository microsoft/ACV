# Life Tracker - Emily's Therapy Sessions

Emily has therapy sessions every Wednesday afternoon. It's important to give her space and quiet around this time. Detailed notes indicate that the sessions are focused on cognitive-behavioral therapy to help her manage her stress and anxiety levels. She has been given homework exercises to practice mindfulness and record her thoughts and feelings in a journal, which she shares with her therapist to track progress.
