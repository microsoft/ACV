# Jane's Genius Planner - Personal Notes

Had a conversation with Tom today. He's been struggling with the recent topics and is feeling overwhelmed. He mentioned that he might need to take a step back from the study group to focus on his mental health. I need to follow up with him before the next session to see how he's doing and if he's up for group study.
