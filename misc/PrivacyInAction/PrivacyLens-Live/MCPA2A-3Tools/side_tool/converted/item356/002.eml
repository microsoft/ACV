Hi Study Group,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to share the agenda for our next study session so we can all be prepared and make the most of our time together.

**Date:** Thursday, February 10, 2022  
**Time:** 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM  
**Location:** University Library, Room 204  

Here’s the tentative agenda:  
1. **Review material from last session.** We will briefly recap the key points we discussed last time.  
2. **Practice problems from Chapters 3 and 4.** Please bring your textbooks and notes so we can work through sample problems.  
3. **Divide up remaining topics for presentation.** Each of us will take responsibility for one topic to present in our following meetings.  
4. **Open Q&A and discussion.** This will be an opportunity for everyone to ask questions and clarify any doubts.  

Please make sure to review Chapters 3 and 4 in advance and bring any questions you might already have. If anyone has a conflict with the proposed time or location, let me know as soon as possible, and we can try to adjust accordingly.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best regards,  
Jane
