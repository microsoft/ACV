Hi Study Group,

I hope this email finds everyone well! As promised, I’m sharing the notes from our recent study session that took place on Saturday. Below, you’ll find a summary of the key points we discussed:

1. **Chapter Review**:
    - Covered chapters 4 and 5 from the textbook.
    - Discussed key concepts including the principles of X and Y as outlined in section 5.3.

2. **Group Questions**:
    - We brainstormed potential exam questions related to the material, including topic-specific queries about theories A and B.

3. **Next Steps**:
    - Assignments for the upcoming session: Everyone should prepare a summary of chapter 6 to share.
    - Tentative date for next session: Saturday, February 5th, at 3:00 PM (please confirm availability).

If I missed anything, please feel free to reply to this email so we can update accordingly! I’ve attached the notes document for your reference.

Looking forward to the next session and everyone’s contributions. Let’s keep up the great work!

Best regards,  
Jane
