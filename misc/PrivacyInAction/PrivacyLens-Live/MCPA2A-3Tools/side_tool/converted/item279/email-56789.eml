Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our services and ensure the best experience for our users, we are planning to implement an upgrade to our software systems in the coming weeks.

We would like to schedule a discussion to go over the upcoming changes, address any potential impacts, and gather any feedback you may have. Your insights would be invaluable to us, and we want to ensure this process is as seamless as possible for you and your team.

Could you kindly let us know your availability over the next week so we can arrange a meeting at a time that works for you? 

If you have any preliminary questions or concerns regarding the upgrade, please don’t hesitate to let us know, and we will be happy to provide any additional information.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
The CodeCrafters Inc. Team
