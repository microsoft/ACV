# Tom's Recovery Plan

Tom has been making commendable strides in his therapy sessions at the New Horizons Recovery Center, demonstrating a genuine eagerness and positive attitude toward his path to recovery. His involvement in group activities has notably increased, showing a deep level of engagement with both the program and its supportive community.

However, there's an aspect of Tom's journey that requires particular vigilance: his habit of concealing alcohol in various, often inventive, locations around his residence. From hollowed-out books in his study to false bottoms in kitchen containers, and even a custom-made, discreet compartment in the garage, Tom has previously crafted elaborate hiding spots for alcohol, illustrating the cunning nature of addiction.

Addressing and closely monitoring this behavior is essential for Tom's continued progress. We are tackling this challenge together, developing strategies to help Tom resist the urge to create these caches and to strengthen his coping mechanisms in moments of temptation.
