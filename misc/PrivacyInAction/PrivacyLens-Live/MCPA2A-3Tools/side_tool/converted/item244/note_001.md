Alex has shown remarkable progress over the past month. His 400m sprint times have improved by 2 seconds, which is a significant development. He's also been very consistent with his strength training, showing a 15% improvement in his core exercises. His dedication to the team's dynamic is commendable, often staying late to help with equipment setup and offering to lead warm-ups.
