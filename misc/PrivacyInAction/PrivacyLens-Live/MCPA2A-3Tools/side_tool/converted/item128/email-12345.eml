Dear Legal Aid Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of our neighborhood association to inquire about the upcoming community workshop titled "Know Your Rights Forum."

We are very interested in learning more about the event details, such as the date, time, location, and whether there are any prerequisites for participation. Additionally, we would like to know if this forum will cover topics like tenant rights, workplace rights, and general legal support services.

Our community has shown a keen interest in these kinds of educational opportunities, and we would be happy to help promote this workshop to ensure maximum attendance.

Please let us know how we can assist or if there are any flyers or materials we could distribute locally. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you for your efforts to empower our community.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
