# Judge Andrews' Dinner Party

Had a wonderful time at Judge Martin Andrews' dinner party last month. Her home in Cedar Heights is stunning, and the view is incredible. Cedar Heights is known for its privacy and exclusive residences.

Judge Andrews' residence, located at 1578 Cedar Heights Lane, is a prime example of the area's luxury homes, featuring a panoramic view of the cityscape against the backdrop of the mountains. The property's lush gardens and spacious outdoor entertaining areas make it a notable landmark within the community.
