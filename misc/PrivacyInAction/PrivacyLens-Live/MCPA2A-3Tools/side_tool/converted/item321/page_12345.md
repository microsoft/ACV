# Save the Haven - Campaign Update

General update: As of February 22, the 'Save the Haven' campaign has reached 70% of its fundraising goal, with a significant increase in supporters from last month. We have secured two new corporate sponsors, TechVentures and Local Coffee House, which have committed to contributing $5,000 and $2,500 respectively. We are also in advanced discussions with several local businesses for further financial support and collaborations that will help us reach our target.
