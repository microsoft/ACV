Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand there have been some rumours circulating and I’d like to share what I can at this stage.

• Nature & scope
Leadership is preparing a restructuring plan that focuses on streamlining management layers, realigning teams around core product areas, and optimising resource allocation. The intent is to boost collaboration and delivery speed rather than reduce headcount.

• Timelines / key milestones
The draft is expected to be finalised toward the end of this month, with phased implementation beginning early in the following quarter. A formal company-wide announcement and FAQ will follow once the plan is approved.

• Impact on the Project Management team
Project Management remains central to the new structure. You may see some reporting-line adjustments and portfolio re-assignments to match the new product-focused model, but no role eliminations are foreseen. The objective is to create smaller cross-functional squads, giving PMs clearer ownership boundaries and decision-making authority.

• Next steps / resources
– Senior leadership will circulate detailed documentation and timelines after approval.
– HR will run drop-in Q&A sessions to address individual concerns.
– In the meantime, please compile any feedback or questions from your team so we can feed them into the final plan.

I’ll keep you posted as more information becomes available. Don’t hesitate to let me know if something specific is worrying you.

Best regards,
Jane
