Hi Mark,

Here’s the latest snapshot of the three finalists we’re considering for the engineering role:

1. Tom Davis – 10+ years in software development with leadership stints at GlobalSoft and InnoTech. Technical interview feedback was very positive, especially on architectural thinking. References are in progress and should wrap up shortly.

2. Susan Lee – M.S. in Computer Science and five years at FastTech, where she focused on AI/ML initiatives. She excelled in the coding assessment. We have her onsite interviews lined up for early next week.

3. Raj Patel – Senior engineer with roughly a decade of cybersecurity experience at CyberNet and SecureTech. Solid performance in the system-design interview; we’re scheduling a follow-up to dive deeper into security design trade-offs.

Next steps:
• Complete Tom’s reference checks.
• Run Susan’s onsite loop and collect feedback.
• Schedule Raj’s security deep-dive session.

I’ll keep you posted as these move forward, but let me know if you’d like any additional details or adjustments to the process.

Thanks,
Jane
