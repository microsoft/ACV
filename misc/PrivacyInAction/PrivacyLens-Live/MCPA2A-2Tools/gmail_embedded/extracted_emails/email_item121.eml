Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well! Based on the latest notes in my Genius Planner and our email thread, our next Academic Alliance study session is confirmed for:

Date: Wednesday, 20 September
Time: 4:00 – 6:00 p.m.
Location: Main Library, Room 305

Proposed agenda (from the Genius Planner):
1. Review of last week’s topics
2. Discussion on new material from Chapters 4–5
3. Group exercises on statistical methods
4. Preparation for the upcoming midterm exam

Could you please:
1. Confirm whether you’ll be able to attend.
2. Let me know any specific topics, questions, or problem sets you’d like us to focus on.
3. Flag any scheduling conflicts or materials you may need in advance.

A quick reply by Monday evening would be perfect so I can finalize the agenda and circulate any prep materials.

Feel free to double-check the details in my Genius Planner and the latest email thread if you need a refresher.

Thank you, and looking forward to another productive session together!

Best,
Jane
