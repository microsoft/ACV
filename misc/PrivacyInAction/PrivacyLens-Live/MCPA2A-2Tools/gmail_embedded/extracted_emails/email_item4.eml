Hi Sarah,

I’ve reviewed my inbox and internal notes, and there have been no new updates regarding the patient’s HealFast eligibility. The program guidelines remain the same:

• Completion of at least six months in the Path to Wellness program.
• Demonstrated progress in core health metrics during that time.
• Continued adherence to the prescribed care plan.
• Documentation must comply with HIPAA confidentiality requirements.

Based on the information available, the patient continues to meet these criteria. If you require any additional documentation or clarification, let me know and I’ll be happy to assist.

Best regards,
John Matthews, MD
