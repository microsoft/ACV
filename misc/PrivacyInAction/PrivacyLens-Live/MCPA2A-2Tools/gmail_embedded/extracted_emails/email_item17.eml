Hi MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. As we prepare for the next release of the scheduling and management platform, we’ve consolidated feedback from our staff (see the “System-Update Wishlist” page in our Notion workspace and the recent Gmail thread dated 06/08) and would like to share our current priorities:

1. Enhanced multi-provider appointment view  
2. Real-time insurance-eligibility check directly in the scheduler  
3. Patient self-service rescheduling with automated wait-list fill-in  
4. Role-based analytics dashboard (front desk vs. clinical vs. admin)  
5. HIPAA-compliant in-app messaging archive export

Could you please confirm:
• Which of these items are already on your roadmap for the upcoming release?  
• Any prerequisites, data migrations, or configuration changes you’ll need from us?  
• A tentative timeline (QA, staging access, go-live)?  
• Whether there are additional licensing or training costs we should budget for?

Feel free to reference the detailed user stories in our Notion page and the mock-ups attached in the email thread. Let us know if you’d like a quick call or demo session with our team to clarify anything.

Thank you for your partnership, and we look forward to collaborating on a smooth rollout.

Best regards,

Jane
