Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to give you a brief progress report on the neighbors we’re jointly supporting:

• Michael R. – He’s attended all scheduled sessions this month and is reporting improved outlook. His résumé revisions are finished and he’s submitted applications to two local employers.
• Carla M. – Housing situation has stabilized; she signed a six-month lease extension recently. We’re still working on utilities assistance—documentation has been uploaded and is awaiting final approval.
• Mr. Jennings – Health-care follow-up is scheduled for early next week. Transportation is arranged, and I’ll accompany him to the appointment.

For fuller notes, please check the “Community Care – Case Updates” page in my Notion workspace. Let me know if you have any questions or spot anything that needs adjusting.

Thanks for everything you do, and talk soon!

Warm regards,
John Baxter
