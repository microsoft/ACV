Hi Team,

I’m helping Jane prepare a thoughtful response to Mr. Thompson’s recent email (editor@vitalvoices.com). Could you please share or point me to the following?

1. A copy of Mr. Thompson’s original message (including any attachments or quoted threads) from Gmail.
2. Relevant notes, talking points, or background material in our Notion workspace about the Vital Voices collaboration.
3. Any specific ideas or highlights Jane wants included in her reply (e.g., personal story angles, availability for an interview, links to previous work).

When you have a moment, please either forward the email thread or let me know where I can find these details in Gmail/Notion.

Thank you so much for the help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
