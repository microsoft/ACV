Hi Vitality Partners Team,

I hope you’re well. We’ve finalized the latest set of requirements for OptiLife’s HealthHub roll-out and would appreciate your quick review.

Where to find the details
• Gmail – I just sent an email titled “HealthHub Requirements v2.3 – Docs & Diagrams” with the updated specification deck and user-flow PDFs attached.
• Notion – Everything is also in our shared space under HealthHub → Requirements → v2.3.

What we need from you
1. Confirm you’ve received the materials and can access the Notion page.
2. Review the changes (highlighted in yellow) and let us know if anything needs clarification.
3. Share an updated implementation timeline or any resourcing concerns by EOD Friday, May 24.

Your confirmation will help us keep the project on schedule.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention. Please let me know if you have any trouble locating the documents.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
Health Program Coordinator, OptiLife Inc.
