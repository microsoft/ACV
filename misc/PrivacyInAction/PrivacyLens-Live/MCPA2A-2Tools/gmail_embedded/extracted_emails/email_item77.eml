Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’re keeping well and enjoying retirement.

I wanted to share a brief update on the Heathrow Terminal 5 expansion work I’m supporting and would be grateful for any insights you can offer.

Key items in progress:
• Airside stand re-configuration to accommodate the next-generation wide-body fleet
• Passenger-flow modelling for the new satellite concourse (Level 2 departures)
• Early sustainability assessments – targeting roughly a 40 % reduction in operational carbon versus the 2008 baseline

A more detailed, living brief (including sketches, phasing diagrams and preliminary capacity numbers) is available here:

If you have time to review, I would especially welcome your thoughts on our stand-allocation strategy and any potential passenger-flow pinch points. Feel free to leave comments directly in Notion or let me know a convenient time for a quick call.

Thank you again for the guidance you’ve given me through the years. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Warm regards,

Jane
