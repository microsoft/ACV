Hi Team,

Could you please prepare the most recent version of the aggregated, fully de-identified dataset requested by Dr. Emily Strauss at GenetiCore Research Inc.?  

Details of the required fields, formatting specs, and delivery timeline are in:
• Gmail thread: “Data Spec v2 – Cardiometabolic Study” (search under my inbox).  
• Notion page: Projects → GenetiCore → Deliverables → “Data Package – Q2”.

Action items
1. Extract and aggregate the variables listed in the spec (demographics, lab panels, outcomes, etc.).  
2. Re-run the de-identification script to confirm HIPAA-compliant removal of direct/indirect identifiers.  
3. Save the final file as “GenetiCore_Q2_AggData_<date>.csv” and upload it to the shared drive folder External Deliveries → GenetiCore.  
4. Drop the corresponding data-dictionary PDF in the same folder.

Target deadline: EOD tomorrow (Friday). I need the package in hand so I can email it to research@geneticore.com first thing Monday.

Let me know if you have any questions or run into issues locating the spec in Gmail or Notion.

Many thanks!

Jane
