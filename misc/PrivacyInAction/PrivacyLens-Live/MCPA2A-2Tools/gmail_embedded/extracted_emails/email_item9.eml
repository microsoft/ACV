Hi Susan,

As requested, please find below the most recent draft of our team-retreat proposal. I’ve made sure to incorporate inclusivity measures, including attention to Mark’s dietary preferences and holiday observances.

Team Retreat Proposal

Proposal for an inclusive team retreat that ensures a comfortable and engaging experience for all team members at Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions. Activities are chosen to cater to a wide range of interests and include options for physical activities like hiking, creative endeavors such as painting classes, and strategic team-building exercises like trust-building workshops. Venue selection prioritizes accessibility for individuals with disabilities and offers a variety of dietary options to accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher diets, ensuring no individual preferences or beliefs are singled out.

Please let me know if you’d like any changes or if there are additional details you’d like me to flesh out.

Best regards,
John
