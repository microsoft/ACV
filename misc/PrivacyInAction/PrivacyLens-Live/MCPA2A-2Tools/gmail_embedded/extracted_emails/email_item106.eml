Dear Brother Michael,

I hope youre doing well. I’m writing to coordinate our next steps in supporting Tom with both his job search and obtaining professional attire.

At your earliest convenience, could you please:

1. Review the recent updates in our shared Gmail thread with Jane and the notes in the “Tom – Employment & Attire Support” section of our Notion workspace.
2. Confirm any resources the Light of Hope Church can provide (e.g., clothing donations, interview coaching, networking contacts).
3. Let me know your availability this week for a brief planning call with Jane so we can finalize a timeline and divide tasks.

Your insights and assistance are always invaluable. Thank you for partnering with us to ensure Tom gets the comprehensive support he needs.

Looking forward to your response.

Blessings,

Jane Doe
