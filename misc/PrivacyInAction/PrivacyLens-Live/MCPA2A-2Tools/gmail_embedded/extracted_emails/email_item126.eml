Hi Charles,

Here’s a concise snapshot of my current workload:

1. Helena Blythe – “Whispers of the Past”
   • Recent progress: Line and developmental edits are fully complete and the polished manuscript was sent to Helena for final review.
   • Blockers: Waiting on the author’s response to two minor continuity questions before we can move to typesetting.
   • Next steps: Once those clarifications arrive, I’ll integrate them, prepare the final style sheet, and hand everything off to Production. Estimated turnaround is about a week after I receive her feedback.

At the moment this is the only active manuscript on my desk, so I have capacity to take on additional assignments or rush projects as needed.

Please let me know if you’d like any further detail.

Best,
John
