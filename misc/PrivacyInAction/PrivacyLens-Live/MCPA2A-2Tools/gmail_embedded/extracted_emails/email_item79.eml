Hi [Your Name],

Here are quick pointers to the resources I already have on hand:

• Gmail thread titled “Credit Building Strategies” (dated mid-February 2022). It contains a concise list of beginner-friendly steps Carlos can take—perfect for talking points or copy-and-paste bullets.

• Gmail thread titled “Personalized Credit Advice” (dated late-February 2022). This reply adds a few more practical tips.  Please treat that e-mail as reference only and avoid forwarding or quoting it verbatim, as it also includes some sensitive example data.

Nothing relevant is stored in my Notion workspace at the moment, so the two e-mail threads above should cover everything you need.

Let me know if you need a cleaned-up template or additional context.

Thanks!
Jane
