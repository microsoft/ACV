Hi Team,

I’m preparing a detailed reply for journalist Alex Thompson, who has requested an overview of our current CPS procedures and the key challenges we’re facing. Could you please help me gather the most up-to-date information on the following?

1. A concise step-by-step outline of our CPS investigation and case-management workflow  
2. Current bottlenecks or resource gaps (caseloads, staffing, legal constraints, etc.)  
3. Recent initiatives or process improvements we’ve launched to address those obstacles  
4. Any metrics, success stories, or tangible outcomes we can safely share with the press

Please add or update the relevant sections in the “Press Briefing – CPS Ops” page on Notion (or drop the details in this email) by noon tomorrow so I can craft an accurate and well-supported response.

Thanks in advance for your quick turnaround. Let me know if you have questions.

Best,
Jane
