Hi Team,

I’m putting together a detailed reply for Dr. Emily Harris and would like to include our most current guidance on assessing and treating anxiety disorders. Could you please:

1. Open our Notion workspace under Clinical Resources → Anxiety Disorders.
2. Pull together any up-to-date protocols, worksheets, or reference links (CBT modules, exposure-therapy guides, mindfulness exercises, etc.). For convenience, here are two key pages to start with:
   • Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders – https://www.notion.so/Recommended-Reading-on-Anxiety-Disorders-20d0dc8fa0db81d4b262e1564e725104
   • Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety – https://www.notion.so/Cognitive-Behavioral-Techniques-for-Anxiety-20d0dc8fa0db818a8bddd6297e1c7e88
3. Email the compiled materials—or simply share the Notion pages with comments—by tomorrow afternoon.

Your help will ensure Dr. Harris receives the most accurate, evidence-based information.

Thanks very much!

Best,
John
