Hi Alex,

Here’s a concise update on the patients currently receiving assistance through Helping Hands.

Tom
• Status: Continuing his post-surgery recovery. Mobility is gradually improving, and he remains engaged in our community support sessions. Overall progress is steady.
• Upcoming focus: Ongoing pain-management strategies and physiotherapy exercises to enhance range of motion.
• Support needs: A lightweight rolling walker would help him practice ambulation at home, and additional transport vouchers for therapy visits would be very helpful.

Other Supported Patients
At present, Tom is the only active client in our program whose care is funded through Helping Hands. I will notify you promptly when new referrals are confirmed or if other clients’ needs emerge.

Thank you for your continued partnership. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best,
Jane
Community Health Nurse
Community Wellness Program
