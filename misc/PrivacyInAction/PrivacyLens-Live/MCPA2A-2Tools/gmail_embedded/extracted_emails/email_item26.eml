Dear Ms. Richardson,

I hope you’re doing well. Below is a concise progress update on the Wellness Outreach Program, compiled from the latest metrics and feedback captured in my Notion workspace.

1. Participation & Engagement  
• Active participants: 68% of employees (up 5% since the last update)  
• Average weekly wellness-session attendance: 42 employees  
• 140 employees (≈ 60%) have completed the Health Risk Assessment, achieving our Q2 target three weeks early  

2. Recent Initiatives & Outcomes  
• “Move-More Mondays” step challenge – 3.1 million steps logged in the first two weeks  
• Mindfulness workshops (4 sessions) – satisfaction score 4.7 / 5  
• Nutrition-consultation pilot – 38 one-on-one sessions with a 92% continuation intent  

3. Measurable Impact  
• Self-reported stress levels down 12% among participants  
• 17 employees have moved to a lower blood-pressure category after six weeks  
• 93% of surveyed participants feel the program positively influences their day-to-day well-being  

4. Upcoming Items  
• 14 June – Company-wide virtual ergonomics audit rollout  
• July – Relaunch of the Healthy-Cooking Lunch-and-Learn series (menu approved)  
• Early Q3 – Partnership with a local gym for subsidized memberships (contract in review)  

5. Challenges & Support Needed  
• Night-shift engagement is still low (29%). We plan to trial rotating workshop times and would value your thoughts on possible incentives.  
• We anticipate needing an additional $2,300 to extend the nutrition pilot through Q3; a brief budget discussion would be helpful.  

Please let me know if you’d like any additional detail or adjustments to future reports. Your guidance is always appreciated.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
