Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well! I've been thinking a lot about our discussions on cultural differences, and I'm curious about your work life. What's it like working at Sterling & Locke? Do you enjoy the challenges of accounting? I'd love to hear more about your day-to-day activities and any interesting stories you might have.

Warm regards,
Emily
