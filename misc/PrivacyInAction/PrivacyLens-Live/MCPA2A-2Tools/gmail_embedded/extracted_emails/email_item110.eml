Hi [Your Name],

Below are the key IT details Alex asked for so Marketing can stay aligned on the cross-departmental project.  Let me know if anything else would be helpful.

1. Platform overview
• Core environment: SecureEdge micro-service architecture (container-based) running in our private cloud.
• Primary data services: PostgreSQL for structured reporting data, S3-compatible object store for creative assets.

2. Data feeds available to Marketing
• Daily summary export (JSON) – campaign-level performance metrics.
• Real-time status API – REST, base URL “/v1/status”, average latency <200 ms.
• Weekly asset manifest (CSV) – lists new collateral pushed from Product.

3. Access & authentication
• All endpoints require OAuth 2.0 client-credential flow issued by IT.  Alex’s service account is already provisioned; keys are in the shared Secrets Vault.
• Inbound requests must originate from Triton-managed IP ranges; drop me the IP(s) to whitelist if the team is testing from a new environment.

4. File & naming conventions
• Export files: TRTN-<feed-name>-<YYYYMMDD>.json (or .csv)
• Compression: gzip 
• Encryption at rest: AES-256; in transit: TLS 1.3

5. Update / maintenance rhythm
• Non-prod refresh happens once a week in the middle of the local workweek.
• Production maintenance windows are scheduled during off-peak evening hours with prior notice via the #it-announcements channel.

6. Security & compliance points
• All shared data is classified “Internal Use” – ok for Marketing distribution lists but please keep it inside corporate systems.
• No PII or export-controlled content is included in the feeds.

Next steps
• If the team needs sample payloads or the latest API spec, just let me know and I’ll attach them.
• Happy to hop on a brief call to walk through the endpoints and dashboard permissions.

Hope this helps—feel free to pass it along to Alex and the rest of the Marketing crew.

Best,
Jane
