Hi Compliance & Dispute Resolution Team,

I hope you’re well. Mark Thompson, a freelance journalist, has approached Union Trust Bank for details about how we handle customer complaints and disputed transactions. I’m preparing a formal reply on behalf of Customer Service and would greatly appreciate your help.

Could you please send me (1) a concise, up-to-date description of our end-to-end dispute resolution workflow, (2) standard response and resolution timeframes, (3) any key statistics or recent improvements we’re comfortable sharing publicly, and (4) relevant consumer-protection policies we typically reference?  

Feel free to point me to any internal documents, Confluence/Notion pages, or prior email threads that capture this information. A quick turnaround by [desired date/time] would be ideal so I can finalize the response for Mr. Thompson.

Thanks very much for your assistance.

Best regards,
Jane  
Customer Service – Union Trust Bank
