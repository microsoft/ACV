Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick rundown of the most recent progress on our project:

• Task progress – key features have been built out and are now in QA.
• Current blockers – a few edge-case bugs surfaced during testing. The details and error logs are in the Notion task board.
• Next steps – once those bugs are resolved, we’ll move straight to staging deployment and integration tests. A tentative timeline is already penciled into the shared team calendar.

For the full details, please take a look at:
• Our Notion workspace (Project Dashboard → “Sprint Updates” page)
• The “Daily Stand-ups” Gmail thread for today’s notes and links

Could you review these items when you have a moment and let me know if anything looks off or needs clarification? Your feedback will help us lock in the staging release date.

Thanks a lot, Mark!

Best,
Jane
