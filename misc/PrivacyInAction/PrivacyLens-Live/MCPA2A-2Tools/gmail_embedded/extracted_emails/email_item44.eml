Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out—I’m glad to contribute.

Below is a snapshot of the most pressing issues we’re seeing through Harmony Alliance’s day-to-day work. I’ve kept individual details anonymous to safeguard community members.

1. Fear & Legal Vulnerability
• Heightened anxiety about detention/deportation limits people’s willingness to report crimes or seek help.
• High cost and scarcity of trustworthy immigration attorneys cause prolonged uncertainty.

2. Employment & Economic Pressures
• Many undocumented workers are in low-wage, cash-based jobs without benefits or safety protections, making them susceptible to wage theft.
• Rising rents have pushed families to crowd together; our volunteers now support roughly 160 households with periodic food or rent-relief fundraising.

3. Healthcare Access
• Lack of insurance and fear of the “public-charge” rule lead families to forgo preventive care; emergency rooms are often the first point of contact.
• Prenatal and mental-health services are especially under-utilized.

4. Education Barriers
• K-12 students qualify for public schooling, but parents hesitate to engage with schools because of language gaps and documentation fears.
• College-age youth struggle with out-of-state tuition rates and ineligibility for most aid, causing many to pause or drop schooling.

5. Information & Language
• Misinformation spreads quickly on social media and messaging apps; language-appropriate, trusted information remains limited.

6. Pandemic & Recovery
• Household savings were depleted during the pandemic because many were excluded from stimulus programs. Families are still rebuilding.

Data points you may cite (all approximate, aggregated from public records and our internal tallies):
• Roughly one in five foreign-born residents in the metro area lacks legal status.
• In the past 12 months Harmony Alliance has logged over 300 requests for legal clinics, 250 for food assistance, and 110 for rent-relief referrals.
• At our last survey, about 70% of respondents said they avoided medical care during the previous year due to cost or immigration concerns.

Suggested sources for additional context:
• Migration Policy Institute city-level fact sheets.
• Local school district English-Learner enrollment reports.
• State Health Equity Office’s recent immigrant-health brief.

Let me know if you need policy references, quotes, or introductions (with consent) to individuals willing to speak on record.

Hope this helps—feel free to follow up any time.

Best,
Jane
Harmony Alliance volunteer advocate
