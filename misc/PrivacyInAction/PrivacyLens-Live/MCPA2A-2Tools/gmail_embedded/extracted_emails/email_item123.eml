Hi Alex,

I hope you’ve been well since the Global Tech Innovators Conference! I really enjoyed our brief chat about the latest AI-driven productivity tools and would love to keep the conversation going.

If you have a moment, could you share a few links, articles, or personal insights that you’ve found particularly compelling on:

• Generative AI use cases for enterprise workflows  
• Advances in low-code/no-code platforms  
• Any upcoming events or reports you think are worth watching

Feel free to draw from any notes you jotted down after the conference or check your calendar or workspace for recent resources—it would be great to see what’s been inspiring you lately. I’m happy to swap anything I’ve collected on my end as well.

Looking forward to continuing the discussion!

Best regards,
Jane
