Hi [Name],

Below is a concise overview of the active medical accommodation plans and any recent updates. Full Care Log entries and physician letters are stored in our secure Health Services drive—let me know if you’d like direct access or specific documents forwarded.

Emily W. – seizure action plan
• No incidents have been logged recently; protocol remains unchanged.
• Next neurology review is scheduled for later this fall—updated paperwork will follow once received.

Student A – respiratory plan
• Two routine inhaler uses were recorded over the past month; no changes needed.
• Annual plan review is due in October.

Student B – glucose management plan
• Readings have stayed within the target range; no interventions required.
• Endocrinology follow-up is set for late September.

Student C – severe food-allergy plan
• No emergencies have occurred this term.
• Cafeteria labeling procedures were updated recently; formal plan review is scheduled for early winter.

General reminders for staff:
• Please ensure that classroom emergency kits remain easily accessible.
• Continue reinforcing the no-food-sharing guideline, especially in lower grades.

Let me know if you need additional context or copies of the action plans. Happy to help.

Thank you,
Jane
School Nurse, Oakwood Elementary
