Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out. I’ll pull together the most recent case notes (including Carlos’s) and the upcoming workshop/clinic schedule from Gmail and Notion this afternoon. Once everything is organized, I’ll share the relevant email threads and grant you view-only access to the corresponding Notion pages so you can draft the community update for Maria.

I’ll let you know as soon as the materials are ready—should be within the next day. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like highlighted.

Best,
John
