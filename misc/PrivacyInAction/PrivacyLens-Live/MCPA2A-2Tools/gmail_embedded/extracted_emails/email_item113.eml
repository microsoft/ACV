Hi Kate,

Thanks for passing along Maria’s follow-up. Below is a quick, field-level update you can share with her right away. I’ll also upload the full reference sheet and links to the Notion workspace this afternoon.

1. Secured cards & credit-builder loans
• Capital One Quicksilver Secured and Discover it Secured both lowered the refundable deposit to $200 and now start automatic graduation reviews after six on-time payments.
• Self’s new “Build & Secure” combo lets members convert the savings from their credit-builder loan directly into a secured-card deposit—no extra credit pull.
• ITIN-friendly newcomers: Oportun® Visa, Deserve® EDU, and the Tomo Card (cash-flow underwriting) remain solid; rates have edged down slightly in 2024, but a linked primary checking account is still required.

2. Establishing history without an SSN
• ITIN-only credit cards noted above plus the Nova Credit “Credit Passport” service (now live with American Express and MPOWER) allow clients to port positive overseas history.
• Rent/utility reporting: Esusu, RentReporters, LevelCredit, and Experian Boost all accept ITINs. Esusu’s new partnership with Fannie Mae means rent data now reaches all three bureaus.
• Cell-phone payment reporting via StellarFi or Perch can add an additional low-risk trade line in 30–45 days.

3. Pitfalls we’re seeing right now
• “Subscription” credit lines that charge monthly fees for a small limit (e.g., some FES-style products) often cost more than the score benefit.
• Secured cards with processing or program fees (First Progress Select, OpenSky Gold) negate the advantage of the low deposit—better to steer clear unless no-fee options are truly off the table.
• Rent-to-own electronics marketed as “credit builder” still report as consumer-finance loans at very high APR; advise newcomers to avoid these offers.

4. Multilingual/community education materials
• CFPB’s updated “Your Money, Your Goals – Immigrant Toolkit” (Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese) – free PDF.
• UnidosUS & Mission Asset Fund webinars (Spanish) on ITIN lending and remittances – recorded sessions available on their sites.
• FDIC Money Smart 2024 edition now includes Haitian Creole and Portuguese modules.
• Better Money Habits has added closed-captioned Arabic and French playlists covering U.S. credit basics.

Let me know if Maria would like a deeper dive or a virtual Q&A session. Happy to help.

Best,
John
