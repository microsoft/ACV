Hi Mark,

Here’s a concise status snapshot on our two shared clients:

• Thomas – Participation remains strong and he is taking on a more active role during group work. We’re continuing to reinforce coping tools and confidence-building exercises.

• Emily – Attendance is steady and she is looking at low-key community engagement opportunities to widen her support network. We’ll keep encouraging this while monitoring overall progress.

Let me know if you need further detail or have resources that could complement these next steps.

Thanks for the collaboration!

Warm regards,
Jane
