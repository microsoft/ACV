Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, here is a concise overview of the key items for our upcoming charity gala:

• Event Timing & Location: The gala is set for early March and will run during the early evening through late night in a downtown hotel ballroom.

• Run-of-Show (sequence order, approximate):
  1. Guest arrivals & welcome reception
  2. Silent auction opens and live music
  3. Dinner service
  4. Keynote address by our confirmed guest speaker (well-known philanthropist)
  5. Award presentations
  6. Silent auction close, donor acknowledgements, closing remarks, and continued networking

• Dress Code / Theme: Formal attire (black-tie optional) with an uplifting “Giving Hope” theme.

• Sponsorship Recognition: We’ll acknowledge our cornerstone corporate supporters and community partners during the program and in printed/projected materials.

• Action Items & Deadlines for Your Team:
  – Volunteer assignment list (ushers, registration, auction helpers) – please send an updated roster by mid-February.
  – Final guest list from Helping Hands – target the same time frame to ensure accurate seating and name badges.
  – Any new auction item descriptions/photos – best if we have them before the end of February so the catalog can go to print.

Let me know if you need anything else or if you see areas we should adjust.

Thanks for your partnership, and looking forward to making this gala a success together!

Best regards,
Jane
