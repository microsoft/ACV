Hi everyone,

Professor Mark Harrison has asked for our perspectives on boosting student engagement in our sociology courses. I’m drafting a comprehensive response on Jane’s behalf and would appreciate your quick input.

Could you please:
• Check your recent class notes, Gmail threads, and the “Student Engagement” workspace in Notion.
• Share any data, anecdotes, or strategies (e.g., participation metrics, successful in-class activities, digital tools, or feedback summaries) that illustrate what has worked well—or not—in your sections.
• Add the information directly to the “Student Engagement – Spring 2024” page in Notion, or reply to this email if that’s easier.

A few highlights we’re especially interested in:
1. Interactive techniques (polls, breakout discussions, experiential projects, etc.).
2. Changes in assignment design that raised participation.
3. Quantitative evidence (attendance trends, discussion board stats, quiz completion rates).
4. Student feedback or testimonials (anonymous comments are fine).

If possible, please update or reply by Thursday at 3 PM so we can incorporate everything into the response to Professor Harrison before the end of the week.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,

Jane
Department of Sociology
