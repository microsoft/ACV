Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m currently handling a complex litigation matter at Carter & Associates and would greatly value your strategic perspective.

I’ve shared a concise case brief and supporting documents with you via our secure Notion workspace (and copied them to the Gmail thread for convenience). At your earliest convenience, could you please review the materials and let me know any thoughts you have on:

• Key risks you foresee for our client
• Potential arguments or defenses we should emphasize
• Any precedents or resources you recommend we examine

If you prefer a call, just let me know some times that work for you and I’ll set it up.

Thank you in advance for your guidance—I always appreciate your insights.

Best regards,

Jane
Associate, Carter & Associates
