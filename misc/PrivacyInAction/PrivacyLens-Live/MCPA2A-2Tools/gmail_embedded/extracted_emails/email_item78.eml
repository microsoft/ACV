Hi John,

Here’s a brief overview of the most recent information I located:

Gmail
• One recent message titled “Summary of Remote Learning Study Findings” (dated within the past month).
• The attached document in that message contains updated performance metrics and participation rates, along with an analysis of how students’ geographic distribution relates to engagement.

Key Takeaways (from the email & attachment)
• Overall student performance has trended upward since the previous checkpoint.
• Participation rates in synchronous remote sessions remain high, with notable increases among students in regions that previously showed lower attendance.
• Preliminary analysis suggests a correlation between geographic distance from campus and preferred modes of participation (live vs. recorded sessions).
• Recommendations in the document highlight continuing targeted support for lower-engagement areas and exploring additional asynchronous resources.

Notion
• I was unable to locate a page or database titled “Remote Learning Study – Findings” in the current workspace. It’s possible the content hasn’t been added yet or is stored under a different name.

Next Steps
• Let me know if you’d like me to re-check Notion with alternate titles or confirm where the findings page should reside.
• If you need the original attachment forwarded, just say the word and I’ll pass it along.

Hope this helps in preparing your update for Dr. Smith.

Best regards,
[Your Assistant]
