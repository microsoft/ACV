Hi Data & Assessment Team,

I hope you’re doing well. Mr. Thomas Green from EdTech Innovations has asked for our latest, fully de-identified student-performance metrics to help improve their learning modules. Could you please help me pull together the following aggregated data (no PII):

• Overall proficiency percentages in Math, ELA, and Science
• Average growth on state assessments (last three years)
• Breakdown of proficiency by grade level (9-12)
• Participation rates for each assessment

When you have a moment, please:
1. Check the email thread labeled “EdTech/Green” in my Gmail for additional context.
2. Review the “EdTech Partnerships → Performance Metrics” page in Notion to see last year’s format and update it with the new figures.
3. Drop the finalized summary (PDF + spreadsheet) in the shared “EdTech Data Exports” folder and let me know once it’s ready.

Ideally, I’d like to send Mr. Green an updated report by end of day Friday.

Thanks so much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
