Dear Emily,

I hope you’re doing well. Here’s a concise update on the current effectiveness of our university’s curriculum based on the most recent semester review:

• Overall student performance rose by roughly 12 % compared with the previous curriculum cycle.
• Engagement indicators—including attendance, discussion-board activity and project-submission rates—improved by 8–15 %.
• Student feedback is overwhelmingly positive about the hands-on, real-world learning components.
• The most common improvement requests involve additional support for advanced analytical/statistics units and more review sessions before major assessments.

To address the latter points, we’re planning supplemental workshops and extra review opportunities in the coming term. We’ll continue monitoring outcomes and will share further results once they’re available.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional detail or a different format for your report.

Best regards,
John
Professor, [Department] University
