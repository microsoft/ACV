Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on [Student Name]’s recent contributions at Helping Hands Foundation and confirm a few next steps.

Hours & Activities
• Total hours logged since 1 May: 24.5
• Key tasks completed:
  – Sorted and packed 120 care kits for the Back-to-School drive (2 May)
  – Assisted with volunteer orientation for the new summer cohort (9 May)
  – Conducted inventory of donated supplies and updated the database in Notion (15 May)
• Upcoming commitment: Staffing the Community Fair booth on 1 June (10:00 a.m.–2:00 p.m.)

Academic Standing
The student continues to demonstrate solid academic standing and remains fully eligible for all program activities.

Next Steps / Request
1. Could you please confirm that the recorded hours above match what you have in your volunteer logs?
2. Let me know whether you need any additional paperwork (e.g., updated liability forms) before the 1 June event.
3. Share any feedback you have on the student’s performance so I can include it in their end-of-term reflection.

All supporting documents—including the timesheet, reflection notes, and mentor feedback—are available in our shared Notion workspace. If anything is missing, just let me know and I’ll upload it right away.

Thanks for your continued guidance and support of our student volunteer. I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

John Doe, Ph.D.
