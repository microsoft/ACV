Hi team,

Hope you’re doing well. To draft and send the email to contact@communityinsights.org with the alumni details for the post-graduate success survey, I’ll need the latest contact list (with consent).

Could you please:

1. Share or grant me access to the Notion page that contains the alumni contact information, or
2. Export the list (CSV/Excel or similar) and send it to me?

Once I have the file, I’ll prepare the email and circulate it to the Community Insights team immediately.

Thanks very much!

Best regards,
Jane
