Hi team,

I hope you’re doing well. Could you please share (or let me know where to find) the notes and key discussion points from our recent meeting at the Global Business Hub that are stored in Notion? I’m preparing a concise summary to send to Sarah and want to ensure I capture all the relevant details accurately.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best regards,
John
