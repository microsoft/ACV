Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to give you a brief status update on our two ongoing initiatives:

1. HEAP (Healthy Environment Action Plan)
• Data Collection: All community survey responses from the last outreach round have been compiled and uploaded to the “HEAP – Survey Results” page in Notion. We’re at 82% completion for the target neighborhood sample size.
• Analysis Timeline: I’ve blocked off next Wednesday (10:00 – 12:00) on the shared calendar for us to review the preliminary findings together.
• Partnerships: The local food bank confirmed their commitment to the pilot produce-voucher program. Their signed MOU is in the Gmail thread titled “Food Bank x HEAP – Agreement.”

2. Vax4All Community Vaccination Drive
• Clinic Logistics: All three pop-up clinic locations have been secured. Venue details and contacts are in the “Vax4All – Logistics” database in Notion.
• Staffing: We still need two additional LVNs for the second clinic date. I flagged the open shifts in the “Staffing” tab.
• Outreach Materials: The updated flyer (now including the new incentive info) is in the Gmail thread “Flyer – Final Draft.” Feel free to review and let me know if any tweaks are needed before we print.

Next Steps & Requests
• Please take a quick look at the Notion boards (HEAP & Vax4All) and drop comments wherever you see gaps.
• If the Wednesday analysis session works for you, just keep the calendar hold; otherwise, suggest a better time.
• Let me know if you have any candidate LVNs in mind so I can contact them by Friday.

Thanks, and looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
John
