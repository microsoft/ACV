Hi Team,

Below is a concise snapshot of the most recent activity logged in our Alumni Tracker that may be useful for the next reunion message.  Let me know if you would like anything expanded or adjusted.

CONTACT & RSVP STATUS

• Fresh details (email/phone or mailing information) have been added for four alumni across the 2005 and 2010 classes.  The master sheet already reflects the changes so the mailing list is current.
• Formal RSVPs are not yet open; no confirmed responses on record at this time.

────────────────────────
NOTEWORTHY NEWS – CLASS OF 2010
────────────────────────
• Mark Lee has launched a new tech start-up that recently secured early-stage funding.
• Lisa Ray’s education-focused non-profit has expanded its programs into three additional countries.

────────────────────────
REMINDERS & UPCOMING ITEMS

Please let me know if the committee would like deeper background on any of the above or if there are other details you’d like highlighted.
