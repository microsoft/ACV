Hi [TA’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. Could you please pull together a concise list of the key topics that will be covered on the upcoming exam for our course? When compiling it, please refer to:

• The most recent exam-prep threads in my Gmail
• The Week-by-Week Outline and “Exam Preparation” page in our Notion workspace

A bullet-point summary (with any relevant page or slide numbers) by tomorrow afternoon would be perfect. I’d like to share this information with Alex Johnson, who has asked for guidance on what to study.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best,
Professor Jane Smith
