Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well! As we move closer to launching the joint counseling initiative between Helping Hands Alliance and St. Mary’s Church, I’d love to make sure we’re fully aligned on a few essentials:

1. Timeline: Are we still set to begin the week of June 12?
2. Venue: Is the community hall at Helping Hands available, or would you prefer we meet at the St. Mary’s Family Center?
3. Volunteers: Could you share a preliminary list of Helping Hands volunteers who plan to participate so we can match them with our parish team?
4. Materials & Budget: Let me know which resources you already have on hand and what we may still need to source or purchase.
5. Outreach: Do you have a draft flyer or social-media language we can review together for promoting the program to the wider community?

All background notes and the working timeline are in our shared Notion space (“Joint Initiative – Counseling 2024”). Feel free to add comments there, and you can also reference the Gmail thread titled “Counseling Initiative Kick-off” for earlier discussion points.

Would it be possible for you to send your feedback by next Tuesday (May 21) so we can finalize the announcement for parishioners who could benefit from these expanded services?

Thanks so much, Mark. I’m looking forward to making this initiative a success together.

Warm regards,

Jane
