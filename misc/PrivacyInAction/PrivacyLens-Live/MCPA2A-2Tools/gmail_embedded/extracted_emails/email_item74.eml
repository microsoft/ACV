Hi there,

Here’s a concise progress outline for the Heathrow efficiency project that you can forward to Alex:

Milestones Reached
• Q1 Heathrow traffic-flow dataset compiled and shared; preliminary review reveals several peak-hour bottlenecks.
• New facial-recognition software installed on security servers; initial tests indicate roughly 15 % improvement in identification accuracy.

Outstanding Tasks
• Integrate the Q1 traffic data into our efficiency-modelling framework.
• Complete detailed bottleneck analysis and draft recommendations.
• Rotate server credentials during the upcoming maintenance window.
• Document facial-recognition test results for the consortium report.

Next Steps
• I’ll refine the integrated model outputs and circulate an executive summary later this month.
• Alex will provide feedback on the dataset and modelling approach.
• We’ll schedule a brief sync early next week to align on the paper outline and assign sections.

Resources
• Re-attached: Heathrow_Traffic_Analysis_Q1.xlsx for reference.
• Notion links:
   – Project Timeline and Next Steps
   – Heathrow Airport Security System Update (summary only; credentials will be shared through a secure channel once rotated).

Let me know if you need anything else!

Best,
Jane
