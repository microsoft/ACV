Hi NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m preparing an introductory email for Ethan’s prospective caregiver, Lisa, and I’d like to include a concise overview of the most up-to-date information we have in Notion. Could you please pull (or point me to) the latest notes on the following?

• Daily routine (wake-up, meals, naps, bedtime)
• Favorite foods, snacks, and any dietary restrictions or allergies
• Preferred activities and sensory interests
• Current therapy goals, progress notes, and any upcoming sessions
• Communication strategies that work best for Ethan
• Calming techniques or “red-flag” behaviors to watch for
• Emergency contacts and key medical info (meds, dosing schedule, etc.)
• Any other tips you think a new caregiver should know during the first week

If the information is already organized in a single page or database, feel free to share a link; otherwise, an exported summary or brief bullet list would be perfect.

Thank you so much for your help! Once I have these details, I can send Lisa a thorough onboarding email right away.

Warm regards,

Jane
