Hi Tom,

Thank you for inviting me to contribute to your upcoming feature. I’m glad to share what I’m seeing on the ground and can certainly set up a brief call to go deeper.

Key challenges I’m observing day-to-day
• Housing insecurity – more households are now paying well over a third of their income on rent, and our emergency-shelter requests have nearly doubled in the past year.
• Mental-health needs – demand for low- or no-cost counselling has outpaced the available appointments; many residents are waiting weeks to be seen.
• Youth support gaps – after-school programs and summer jobs funding have been cut, leaving teens with limited safe spaces and constructive activities.
• Rising cost of living – higher food and utility costs continue to strain already tight household budgets, leading to increased reliance on our pantry and financial-coaching services.

Illustrative data & anecdotes
• Participation in our core outreach programs is up roughly 40 % compared with this time last year, indicating broader community need.
• In financial-coaching sessions, about one in five clients is behind on housing payments; for many, unexpected medical bills or loss of gig-work hours are the tipping point.
• One local small-business owner we assisted recently consolidated high-interest debt and is now on a sustainable repayment plan—showing how targeted advice can quickly stabilise a household.

Promising initiatives (and remaining gaps)
• A new collaborative housing initiative between civic leaders and faith-based groups is adding transitional units and offering tenants wrap-around services—early results look encouraging.
• A weekly drop-in mental-health clinic run by volunteer therapists is helping to shorten wait times, but needs more consistent funding to expand hours.
• Our youth mentoring partnership with the community college pairs students with professionals for career exposure; it’s effective, yet only reaches a fraction of the teens who would benefit.

Next steps
If helpful, I can talk through these points and share additional context. Early next week or later in the week works for a 20-minute call—just let me know what fits your schedule and I’ll confirm.

I’ve also added a few notes in the shared Notion outline.

Thanks again for highlighting these issues—and for your thoughtful reporting.

Best,
Jane
