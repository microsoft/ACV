Dear Tom,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m glad to share approaches that have proved effective at Westbrook University and resources your team at HopeBridge Foundation may find helpful.

1. Holistic Orientation & Welcome
   • Offer extended orientation sessions that cover campus resources, local community services, and cultural-acclimation workshops.
   • Pair new arrivals with trained peer ambassadors who can answer day-to-day questions, help with navigation, and model campus culture.

2. Language & Academic Support
   • Provide flexible ESL/academic-English labs supplemented by faculty-led writing circles and subject-specific tutoring groups.
   • Encourage professors to adopt inclusive syllabus language and allow additional processing time on written assignments during the first term.

3. Mentorship & Advising
   • Assign every refugee student both an academic mentor (faculty) and a social mentor (staff or volunteer). Schedule brief, regular check-ins focused on goals, milestones, and emerging needs.
   • Supply mentors with a simple goal-tracking template so progress remains visible for everyone involved.

4. Mental-Health-Informed Programming
   • Partner with counseling services to run small-group workshops on adjustment stress, resilience, and self-advocacy.
   • Offer trauma-informed advising training for frontline staff and faculty.

5. Community Engagement & Belonging
   • Integrate service-learning or civic-engagement projects into coursework; participation helps students build networks while contributing to the community.
   • Host regular intercultural events where students can showcase their heritage and invite the wider campus community.

6. Financial & Logistical Assistance
   • Maintain a centralized information hub for scholarships, emergency grants, and affordable housing leads.
   • Offer practical workshops on banking, taxes, and regulations around part-time work.

Key External Resources
• UNHCR – Education Toolkit for Refugee Students
• Scholar Rescue Fund – Academic Transition Guidelines
• Jesuit Refugee Service – Higher Education Best Practices Manual

Internal Briefs Available
I keep two concise documents that may be useful to your program:
   • “Support Strategies for Refugee Students” – overview of our language program, mentorship model, and engagement activities.
   • “Integration of Refugee Students into Higher Education” – analysis of common barriers and institutional responses.

Let me know if you’d like copies of those briefs or a deeper conversation about any strategy. I’m happy to arrange a virtual meeting with our mentorship coordinators as well.

Wishing you every success in strengthening HopeBridge’s support initiatives.

Warm regards,

Professor Jane [Last Name]
Westbrook University
