Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out. I’ve pulled together a quick snapshot of the most recent customer-service and usage data that should help shape the creative and targeting for your new campaign. (All figures below are aggregated and anonymized.)

1. Core Segments  
• Digital-First Professionals (ages 25–40): 42 % of active customers log in exclusively via the mobile app, averaging 4.8 sessions per week. Primary interests are instant balance alerts, contactless payments, and travel-friendly cards.  
• Growing Families (ages 30–50): 31 % of the base. They engage most with mortgage calculators and college-savings content. Cross-sell opportunities: home-equity lines and 529 plans.  
• Savvy Seniors (55+): 18 %, but account for 27 % of total deposits. Prefer branch phone support and value fraud-protection education. Great audience for trust & wealth-management messaging.

2. Key Motivators & Pain Points  
Motivators:  
• No-fee or low-fee products (mentioned by 58 % in CSAT verbatims)  
• Rapid, human support—93 % CSAT when wait time <60 sec  
• Embedded financial-wellness tools (budget tracker adoption up 37 % YoY)

Pain Points:  
• Confusion around overdraft-protection tiers (“hard to understand” cited by 24 %)  
• Long in-branch wait times during lunch hours (up to 22 min average)  
• Card-replacement process seen as slow (>5 business days)

3. Channel & Content Insights  
• Email open-rate peaks: Weekdays between 8-10 a.m. local; highest CTR when subject line references savings goals or fraud alerts.  
• SMS engagement: 2× higher than email for time-sensitive alerts.  
• Education content (short videos, 60–90 sec) boosts NPS by 11 pts when delivered in-app right after login.

Suggested Messaging Angles  
• “Take control of your goals” theme resonating with Digital-First and Growing Families.  
• Clear, single-line fee explanations to address transparency concerns.  
• “Real people, real help in <60 seconds” promise aligns with top support driver.

Next Steps / Ask  
Could you let me know:  
1. Which of the three segments you plan to prioritize so I can pull deeper persona details (lifestyle triggers, creative examples, etc.)?  
2. Your timeline for final creative—happy to provide additional data cuts or testimonials if needed.  

I’m standing by for any further insights you’d like.
