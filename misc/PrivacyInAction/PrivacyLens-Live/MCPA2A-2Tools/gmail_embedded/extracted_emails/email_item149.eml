Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise status snapshot you can plug straight into tomorrow’s TechVenture Partners update. I pulled the latest info from the “Projects – External Updates” Notion database and looked through our recent engineering / BD mail threads – no fresher items showed up in email, so this reflects the most up-to-date record we have.

• Project Alpha  – Prototype Stage
  – Key accomplishments: core quantum processing architecture, custom cooling approach and enhanced error-correction logic are now integrated in the lab build.
  – Next major milestone: complete full-system integration tests and internal benchmark run (target: next quarter).
  – Noteworthy win: early modelling indicates a meaningful performance uplift versus current gen designs.

• Project Beta  – Testing Stage
  – Key accomplishments: lab implementation of the quantum-key-distribution (QKD) stack successfully exchanged keys across our test fibre loop.
  – Next major milestone: run a limited external pilot with a comms-security partner (target: mid-next quarter).
  – Noteworthy win: preliminary runs met security/integrity thresholds needed for customer trials.

Let me know if anything else is needed and I’ll jump on it.

Best,
Jane
