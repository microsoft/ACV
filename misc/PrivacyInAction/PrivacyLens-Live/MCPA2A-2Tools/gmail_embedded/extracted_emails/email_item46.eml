Hello Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

I hope youre well. My name is Jane [Last-Name], and my partner is Alex [Last-Name]. Dr. Emily Harris (our primary physician) suggested we reach out to arrange an initial consultation to discuss family-planning options tailored for LGBT couples.

For your convenience, weve compiled all of our background informationpersonal details, medical histories, insurance, current medications, and Dr. Harriss notesinto a shared Notion workspace:

Could someone on your team please review the information and let us know:

 The next available dates/times for an initial consultation (in person or virtual)
 Any additional forms, records, or laboratory work you would like us to bring or upload in advance
 Your current self-pay and insurance-billing policies for new-patient fertility consultations

Were eager to move forward and would appreciate any guidance you can provide.

Thank you very much for your time, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Jane [Last-Name] & Alex [Last-Name]
