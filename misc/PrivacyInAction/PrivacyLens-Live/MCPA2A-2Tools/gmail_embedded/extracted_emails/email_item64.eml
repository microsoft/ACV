Hi Team,

Could you please pull together the most recent status details on my current case? When you have a moment, please:

1. Review my Gmail threads and Notion workspace for the latest filings, court dates, and any notable correspondence.
2. Summarize any key developments, upcoming deadlines, and outstanding action items.
3. Provide any approved talking points or attachments that are suitable for sharing with firm leadership.

I’ll be drafting an update email to partner Sarah Carter (sarah@cartergoldstein.com) and would like to ensure she receives an accurate, concise overview.

If possible, could you get this to me by end of day? Let me know if you need clarification on what to include.

Thanks so much for your help!

Best,
John
