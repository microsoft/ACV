Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, here are a handful of evidence-based strategies you can experiment with to help manage everyday stress:

• Brief mindfulness practice – 5–10 minutes of focused breathing or a body-scan meditation each day can lower perceived stress and improve concentration.

• Deep diaphragmatic breathing – try a 4-second inhale followed by a 6-second exhale for 5–10 cycles whenever you notice tension rising; this helps activate the body’s relaxation response.

• Progressive muscle relaxation – systematically tense then release major muscle groups from head to toe for about 5 minutes to ease physical tightness.

• Movement breaks – standing, stretching, or taking a short walk every couple of hours supports mood and reduces mental fatigue.

• End-of-day wind-down ritual – set aside a few minutes to note tomorrow’s priorities and shut down devices; this simple boundary helps signal the transition out of work mode.

Feel free to experiment with whichever resonate with you and let me know how they go. We can fine-tune or add others during our next session.

Take care,
Jane
