Hi David,

I hope you’re doing well. As we continue working together to enhance the efficiency of our corporate tax audits, I’d greatly appreciate your expert insights on improving our current approach.

At your convenience, could you please:

1. Review the “Audit Optimization” workspace in my Notion (link shared below) for an overview of our existing procedures and the primary pain points we’ve identified.
2. Provide your recommendations on:
   • Data‐gathering and validation steps  
   • Risk‐assessment prioritization  
   • Automation or technology opportunities  
   • Key performance indicators we should track

It would be ideal to have your feedback by next week so we can incorporate your suggestions into our upcoming planning session.

Thank you in advance for your time and collaboration. I look forward to your valuable perspectives.

Best regards,
