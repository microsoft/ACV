Hi Michael,

I hope all’s well. I’ve just finished compiling my detailed thoughts on the newest version of the manuscript and placed them in our shared Notion workspace (Modern Relationships Novel → Editorial Feedback → “Jane’s Notes – [today’s date]”).

When you have a moment, could you please give them a read and let me know:

• whether everything is accessible in Notion
• which comments resonate—or raise questions—for you
• any areas you’d like me to expand on before I draft the formal editorial letter

Your feedback will help ensure my next round of edits is as focused and useful as possible.

Thanks so much, and just drop me a quick reply once you’ve had a chance to take a look.

Best,
Jane
