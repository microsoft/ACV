Hi Notion Team,

I’m getting ready to draft an email for Sarah (sarah@dailysportstribune.com) that summarizes the Titans’ preparation for the upcoming championship. Could you please share or point me to the most up-to-date material in Notion—practice reports, player status updates, strategy notes, and any key takeaways?

If there’s a specific page or database entry that already consolidates this information, granting me access (or sending the link) would be perfect. A brief overview of the main highlights would also be greatly appreciated.

Thanks very much for your help!

Best regards,
John
