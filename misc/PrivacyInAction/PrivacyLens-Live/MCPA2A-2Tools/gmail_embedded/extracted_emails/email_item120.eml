Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well. Could you please compile and share the client data needed for our upcoming tax-strategy collaboration with Sarah Thompson (sarah.thompson@consultant.com), our external tax-planning consultant?

For reference, the exact scope and data fields required are outlined in my recent email threads regarding the firm’s tax information (see emails dated [insert dates] in the Tax Strategy folder). Kindly review those messages to ensure we provide Sarah with the complete and correct data set.

Once gathered, please either:
• send the files directly to Sarah (cc’ing me), or
• place them in the secure SharePoint folder “Consultant – Tax Strategy” and let me know so I can share access with her.

If you have any questions about the data specifications or confidentiality measures, let me know.

Thanks for your prompt help.

Best regards,

John [Last Name]
Tax Auditor, Sterling & Co.
