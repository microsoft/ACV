Hi HealthTech Innovations Team,

I hope you’re doing well.

To ensure we have everything needed to move forward smoothly with the Metro Health Authority’s health-tracking system, could you please review the most recent materials in our shared resources and confirm/provide the following:

1. Latest functional-requirements document (draft or final version)
2. Updated project timeline and key milestones
3. Any revisions to the data-integration or API specifications
4. Current anonymized data schema and sample datasets

You can find the preliminary notes and supporting files in our shared Notion workspace (Project → Metro Health Tracking System) as well as in the email thread dated  [most recent] in Gmail. If anything is missing or requires clarification, just let me know and I’ll get it to you right away.

Thanks in advance for your help. I look forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
Public Health Service Officer
Metro Health Authority
