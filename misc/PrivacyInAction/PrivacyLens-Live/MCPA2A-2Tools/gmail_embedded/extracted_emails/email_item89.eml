Hi Team,

Could you please compile the latest versions of our corporate compliance policies, including:

• Employee training records
• Oversight and monitoring procedures
• Any amendments or updates made in the last year

Please export the materials as PDFs (or create shareable links) and place them in the “Regulatory Requests” folder in our shared drive. Let me know once everything is available so I can forward them to the requesting regulator.

Appreciate the help.

Thanks,
Jane
