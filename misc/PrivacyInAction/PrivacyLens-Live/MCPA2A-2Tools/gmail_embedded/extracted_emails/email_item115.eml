Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been refining a series of concepts aimed at streamlining passenger movement through the terminal while fully preserving the security standards you’ve championed. Highlights include:

• A dual-lane queuing system that separates domestic and international travelers earlier in the process.
• Dynamic wayfinding displays that re-route passengers in real time based on TSA wait-time data.
• A reconfigured seating layout near hold rooms to relieve choke points at boarding-pass checks.

For a deeper dive, I’ve compiled detailed notes, sketches, and preliminary throughput calculations in my Notion workspace. Whenever convenient, could you take a look and share your thoughts? Your guidance on potential operational or security pitfalls would be invaluable before I move to the modeling stage.

Thank you for your time and expertise. Please let me know if you’d prefer a brief call or a follow-up meeting to discuss.

Best regards,

John
