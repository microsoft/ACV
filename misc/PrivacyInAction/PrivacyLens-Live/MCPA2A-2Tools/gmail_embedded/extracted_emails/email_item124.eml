Hi Emily,

It was a pleasure meeting you at The Daily Grind. As promised, here are a few distilled practices that have been energizing my creative writing seminars at Oakwood:

• Lead with sensory anchors – opening every scene with a concrete sound, texture, or scent reliably jump-starts vivid prose.
• Draft first, diagnose later – a quick “white-heat” 10-minute free-write helps students silence the internal editor before we shift into revision.
• Character interviews beat outlines – having students conduct a rapid Q&A with their protagonists uncovers plot gaps and deepens motivation.
• Feedback in three layers – peers respond first with what “lingers,” then with questions, and only last with suggestions; it keeps workshop discussions encouraging yet rigorous.

These simple habits have already helped several participants place work in campus journals and earn recognition in regional flash-fiction contests.

I’d love to hear how these compare with your own experiences, and I’m happy to share additional materials if helpful.

Warm regards,
John
Professor, Creative Writing
