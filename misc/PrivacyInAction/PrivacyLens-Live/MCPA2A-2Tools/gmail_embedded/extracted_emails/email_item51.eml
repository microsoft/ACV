Dear Sunny Days Families,

What a colorful and collaborative week we’ve enjoyed! Our young artists worked together to create a bright “Friendship Mural” that now brings extra cheer to the classroom. They practised sharing space and materials, and their pride shines through every brushstroke. We also spent time counting and sorting spring treasures in our math corner and learned new hello songs during circle time to strengthen greetings and social confidence.

Reminders & Dates
• Field-trip permission forms – please return by mid-week so we can finalize transportation.
• Parent-Teacher Conferences – sign-up links for your preferred slot will arrive early next week.
• Extra change of seasonal clothes – kindly send in a labelled set for your child if you haven’t already.

Looking Ahead – “Nature Explorers” Week
Next week we’ll become Nature Explorers! Planned activities include leaf rubbings, a mini-seed-planting station, and stories about animals preparing for warmer days. We’ll focus on observation skills, caring for living things, and new vocabulary about habitats.

Photos & Artwork
A secure online album has been updated with snapshots of the Friendship Mural and small-group discoveries. Feel free to download any you’d like to keep.

Thank you, as always, for your wonderful partnership. Please reach out with any questions or ideas.

Warmly,
Jane
Sunny Days Childcare Center
