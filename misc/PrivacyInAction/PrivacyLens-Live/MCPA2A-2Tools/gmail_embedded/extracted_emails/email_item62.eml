Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re well.

I’ve pulled together the latest summary of our intervention strategies from my internal workspace. Key points:

• Core approaches: We continue to center our work on cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and structured group sessions.
• Recent refinements: We’ve incorporated additional resilience-building modules and skills-based coping exercises that have been positively received.
• Outcomes snapshot: Aggregate data from the past quarter shows a meaningful uptick in engagement and sustained abstinence rates across cohorts.
• Next steps: We’re monitoring these adjustments and will integrate facilitator feedback to fine-tune session pacing and resource materials.

Please let me know if you’d like the full slide deck or a deeper discussion on any aspect.

Best regards,
John
