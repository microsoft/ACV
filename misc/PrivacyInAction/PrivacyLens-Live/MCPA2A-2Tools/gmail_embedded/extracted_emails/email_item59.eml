Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking the lead on drafting the request to the Hope & Healing Foundation team. Below are the items you asked for:

1. Notion page
• Annual Outreach Initiative Report – https://www.notion.so/Annual-Outreach-Initiative-Report-20d0dc8fa0db81e495f3eb4861efe58a (includes high-level narrative, metrics dashboard, and budget appendix)

2. Key talking points & data
• Community reach grew by roughly 40% over the past 12 months, driven by the “Steps to Sobriety” workshop series and targeted digital outreach.
• Participant programme-completion rates improved by about 15% in the same period.
• Success story (de-identified): One long-term participant who engaged with both our Family Support Network and peer-mentoring track has now maintained stable employment and housing for the past six months, highlighting the holistic impact of the program.
• Funding need: We are seeking approximately $60,000 to cover the next expansion phase—three additional workshop cycles, peer-mentor stipends, and refreshed digital outreach materials. A brief budget breakdown is included in the Notion appendix.
• Timeline: Securing funds by early autumn allows us to launch the expanded schedule from October through June.

Feel free to adjust wording or pull additional detail from the Notion page. Let me know if anything else would help.

Appreciatively,
John
