Hello TechSolutions Team,

As requested, please find below a concise overview of Hamilton University’s student-assistantship hiring workflow. We hope this will help guide the design of your new student-management module.

1. Application
• Positions are posted on the Student Employment portal each winter with a firm submission deadline in early spring.
• Applicants complete an online form (see link ❶) and upload a résumé, unofficial transcript, and two references.

2. Initial Screening
• HR reviews submissions within roughly two weeks of the deadline, ensuring eligibility (minimum GPA, enrollment status, hour restrictions) and completeness.
• Qualified packets are forwarded to the relevant academic/administrative units.

3. Interviews
• Units schedule short video or in-person interviews over a three-week window in mid-spring.
• Standard interview guide (link ❷) is used for consistency and equal-opportunity compliance.

4. Selection & Offer
• Hiring committees rank candidates and submit their recommendations to HR.
• HR issues conditional offer letters pending background check and work-study verification.

5. Onboarding
• Selected assistants complete onboarding documents in the HR portal (tax forms, direct-deposit, confidentiality agreement) and attend a mandatory orientation session before their start date in early summer.
