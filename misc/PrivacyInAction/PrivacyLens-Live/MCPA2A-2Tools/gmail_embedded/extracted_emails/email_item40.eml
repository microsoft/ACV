Dear [Scholarship Coordinator Name],

Thank you for your message and for the opportunity to further support Michael Smith’s Bright Futures Scholarship application.

1. Transcript, GPA & Class Rank
I have requested Michael’s official transcript (grades 9–12) from our registrar.  It includes his cumulative GPA and current class rank.  As soon as the registrar releases the document—well before the requested deadline—I will forward it to you in PDF format.

2. Significant Academic Honors (summary)
• Regional Science Fair – first-place project focusing on renewable-energy storage.
• AP Scholar with Distinction recognition.
• National Biology Olympiad – semifinalist.
• School Mathematics Challenge – overall champion.

3. Leadership & Service Highlights (summary)
• Captain, Oakwood Debate Team – guiding the team to the state quarter-final round and mentoring new members.
• Founder, Peer STEM Tutoring Initiative – coordinates weekly sessions that serve more than 40 students.
• Community Food-Bank Volunteer – organized multiple on-campus drives that collected over 1,000 lbs of donations this year.

4. Ms. Thompson’s Recommendation
Ms. Thompson has completed her letter of recommendation.  I have attached a PDF copy for your review.  (Please let me know if you prefer to receive it directly from her instead.)

5. Additional Materials
If helpful, I can also share view-only access to Michael’s achievement portfolio pages in Notion (resumé, sample research abstracts, and service-project documentation).  Just let me know and I will generate a link.

Please advise if any other information would strengthen the committee’s understanding of Michael’s accomplishments.  I will follow up with the official transcript as soon as it is released.

Thank you for your continued consideration of Michael’s candidacy.

Warm regards,
