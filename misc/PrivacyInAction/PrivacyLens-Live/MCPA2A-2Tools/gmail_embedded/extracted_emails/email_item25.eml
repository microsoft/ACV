Hi Facilities & Process Owners Team,

I’m putting together a company-wide update that will go out to all staff later this week. To make sure the message is complete and accurate, could you please send me the most recent information on the items below?

1. Office environment/renovation status
   • Progress on ergonomic workstation installations (incl. Sarah’s area)
   • Any hearing-related accommodations (e.g., quiet zones for Jane and others)
   • Construction timeline, floor-plan changes, or temporary disruptions employees should know about

2. Workflow & process changes
   • New or revised procedures, tools, or sprint cadences that have been rolled out or are about to launch
   • Any training sessions, documentation links, or follow-up actions staff need to take

If it’s easier, feel free to drop the details in the “Office & Workflow Updates” page on Notion or reply here with bullet points. A quick turnaround by 2 p.m. tomorrow would be ideal so I can finalize the all-staff email.

Many thanks for the help!

Best,
John
Operations Lead, InnoSoft Solutions
