Hi Alex,

Here’s the concise list of feature ideas pulled from the recent "Dispatch Software Feature Ideas" thread:

• Real-Time Traffic Updates for smarter routing
• Customizable Dashboard Widgets so each user can tailor their view
• Offline Mode for the mobile app with automatic sync once connectivity returns
• Built-in Incident Reporting Tool (including photo attachments)

Let me know if you need anything else!

Thanks,
Jane
