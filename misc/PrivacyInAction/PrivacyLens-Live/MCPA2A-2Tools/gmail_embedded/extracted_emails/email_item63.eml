Hi [Your Name],

Here’s a concise package of our most recent insights on how passengers perceive the Skyward Terminal’s public spaces. Everything is grouped on the Notion page below, but I’ve pulled the headline take-aways for quick reference.

Notion page – “Passenger Experience Feedback Compilation”
https://www.notion.so/Passenger-Experience-Feedback-Compilation-20d0dc8fa0db81b8bfdfcad99acade04

Key data points
• 78 % of survey respondents said overall way-finding is “clear” or “very clear,” but only 52 % feel confident navigating from curbside to their gate without consulting staff.
• 64 % reported that crowded security queues are their single highest stressor, followed by concerns about personal space in waiting areas (47 %).
• When asked what would most improve comfort, the top three suggestions were: (1) more visible seating variety, (2) quieter "retreat" zones away from main circulation paths, and (3) warmer lighting in restrooms and corridors.
• Nearly one-third of interview participants mentioned feeling vulnerable in restrooms or other semi-supervised zones; safety cues (lighting, line-of-sight layout, staff presence) strongly influenced their sense of security.

Notable qualitative quotes
1. “Once I clear security I just want a corner where I’m not jostled every minute.”
2. “The maps are great, but the moment the crowd builds I can’t see the signs anymore.”
3. “Restrooms feel tucked away—having staff nearby or better lighting would make a huge difference.”

Supporting visuals on the Notion page
• Heat map showing perceived stress ‘hot spots’ across the departures level.
• Bar chart comparing pre- and post-pilot satisfaction scores for new seating vignettes.
• Thumbnail gallery of mood-board imagery passengers rated most calming.

Let me know if you’d like any slide-ready exports or additional breakdowns. Otherwise, everything should be ready for your email to Dr. Smith.

Best,
John
