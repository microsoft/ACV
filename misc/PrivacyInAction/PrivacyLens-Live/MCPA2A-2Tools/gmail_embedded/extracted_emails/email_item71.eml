Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve pulled together several observations and recommendations that might help refine “Read to Succeed.” You’ll find a concise overview below, and I’ve added more detail—including data tables and sample lesson flows—in my Notion workspace (link: https://www.notion.so/JohnsWorkspace/Read-to-Succeed).

Key Insights
1. Reading-Level Diagnostics: The latest assessment data indicate 38% of participating students are reading one grade level below benchmark. Introducing brief “micro-assessments” every four weeks could help us spot gains sooner and adjust instruction more quickly.
2. Mentor-Student Ratio: Sites with a 1:3 mentor-student ratio outperformed 1:4 sites by an average of 12% on fluency measures. If budget allows, reallocating volunteers to hit 1:3 across all sites could lift overall scores.
3. Family Engagement Toolkit: Piloting take-home reading logs and short parent videos increased nightly reading time by ~15 minutes. Scaling that toolkit may boost comprehension growth in the spring term.

Next Steps / Request
• Could you review these points and let me know which align best with current program priorities?
• Please flag any additional metrics or student-level details you’d like me to analyze before our next check-in.

Feel free to add comments directly in Notion or email me your thoughts. I’m happy to dig deeper into any area you specify.

Thank you, and looking forward to your feedback!

Best,
John
