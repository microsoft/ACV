Hi Mark,

Happy to help – we have a handful of items that should cover what you’re looking for:

• Composite mega-columns
  – “Steel–Concrete Composite Mega-Columns for Tall Airport Structures,” CTBUH World Congress 2024 paper (PDF)
  – Internal design memo: “Composite Core–Mega Column Interaction Notes” (covers load path optimisation & slip-critical bolting details)

• Wind-tunnel & tuned-mass-damper data
  – BKL Aero: SkyHigh preliminary wind-tunnel test summary (2022)
  – ATL Expansion Tower: tuned-mass-damper performance monitoring report (2019) – the mass/rubber ratio and control algorithm are directly comparable to SkyHigh’s spec.

• Shear-core drift verification
  – Excel workbook “SkyHigh_Lateral_Drift_v03.xlsx” with load-case envelopes and code checks
  – ETABS FE model “SkyHigh_Core_v22.edb” reflecting the latest concrete grade and coupling-beam stiffness reductions

I’m dropping all of the above into the shared Notion path:
Structural Integrity → SkyHigh Tower → Reference Material.
You’ll see the folder and links by tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon, which should give you at least a full day before your 60 % package deadline.

If you run into any issues opening the ETABS file or want to talk through the wind data, just ping me – I can hop on a quick call.

Cheers,
Jane
