Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re well. Mark has asked me to clarify the details behind Eric’s recent absences. Could you please locate and forward Eric [Last Name]’s personal file—especially his attendance and leave records for the past three months?

The latest version should be in our Gmail “Employee Files” label, but if you find any additional notes in Notion or the HR calendar, kindly include those too.

A quick turnaround would be greatly appreciated so I can update Mark promptly.

Many thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
HR Business Partner
