Hi Mark,

As promised, here’s a concise summary of the latest procurement and supplier information you’ll need for the Q2 budget forecast:

• Updated negotiated price lists for Q2 – you can find the full tables on the Notion page titled “Q2 Budget Forecast.”
• We’re projecting roughly a 5 % increase in raw-material costs due to current market conditions.
• A planned shift toward more sustainable materials may add incremental cost in some categories; details are noted in the same Notion page.
• Contact details for all key suppliers, along with the new account-manager assignments, have been updated in the document as well.
• The detailed cost-breakdown spreadsheets are attached within the Notion page for quick download.

Feel free to let me know if you need any clarifications or additional data.

Best,
Jane
