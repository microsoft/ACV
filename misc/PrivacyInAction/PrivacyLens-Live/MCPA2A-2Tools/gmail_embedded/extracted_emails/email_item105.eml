Dear Deputy Secretary Caldwell,

Thank you for the opportunity to share a snapshot of the operational realities our frontline officers face here in Metro City. Below is a concise briefing drawn from my most recent internal notes and statistics. I hope these observations will help inform your ongoing policy work on public-safety support.

1. Community–Police Collaboration
• Community-led watch programs and informal “Coffee with a Cop” sessions in several districts have cut vandalism and petty theft noticeably.
• Challenge: Scaling these efforts citywide will require additional liaison officers and overtime funding.

2. Changing Crime Mix
• Overall crime fell modestly last year, yet cyber-enabled thefts grew sharply. Patrol officers increasingly encounter digital evidence but have limited training or tools to handle it.
• Opportunity: Targeted investment in digital-forensics skills and regional cyber-investigation labs would yield immediate dividends.

3. High-Profile, Resource-Intensive Investigations
• Serial-offender and other high-visibility cases routinely demand extended surveillance and specialist forensic work, stretching detective resources and slowing everyday case processing.
• Need: Surge-staffing mechanisms or flexible mutual-aid agreements during peak investigative demand.

4. Data & Technology Gaps
• Fragmented case-management systems slow intelligence sharing across precincts.
• Body-worn camera footage is abundant but under-analyzed due to storage costs and review backlogs.

5. Officer Wellness & Retention
• Shift-work fatigue combined with court-appearance overtime is a leading factor in mid-career attrition.
• Early rollout of peer-support clinics and predictable-scheduling pilots shows promise where resourced.
