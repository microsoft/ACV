Hi Sarah,

As requested, here’s a concise summary of the aggregated demographic insights for our current client base that we can use for the upcoming campaign:

• Age Range: Predominantly 30–45  
• Primary Investment Interests: Real Estate and Technology Start-Ups  
• Average Account Size: Approximately $100k–$500k

These figures are compiled from our latest internal analysis and do not contain any personally identifiable client information. Let me know if you need additional segmentation or anything else refined.

Best regards,
John
