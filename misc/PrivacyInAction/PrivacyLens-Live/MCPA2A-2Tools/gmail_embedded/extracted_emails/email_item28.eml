Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Ethan’s recent absences and his transition back to class.

1. Brief reason for absences
Ethan is managing a chronic neuromuscular condition. Recent medication adjustments and follow-up evaluations required a series of clinic visits and additional rest days, which led to the missed school days.

2. Current treatment & activity considerations
• Ethan takes a daily medication that may occasionally cause fatigue and mild mood changes; no doses need to be administered at school.
• He continues weekly off-site physical-therapy sessions.
• Please allow him access to a quiet space if he feels unusually tired or needs to stretch.
• A lightweight laptop or scribe assistance can help during lengthy written tasks when fatigue is noticeable.
• Unrestricted access to water and healthy snacks is recommended.

3. Classroom / schedule modifications
• Permit short rest breaks as needed.
• Reduce high-impact or contact activities in P.E.; he may participate in stretching or other low-intensity alternatives.
• Allow extra time for written assignments and tests.
• Seating near the classroom exit is helpful so he can leave discreetly if he becomes fatigued.

4. Expected timeline for full return
We anticipate gradual improvement over the next several weeks as his body adjusts to the medication, though some day-to-day fluctuation is typical. Ethan can usually attend a full day but may need to leave early on therapy days. We will re-evaluate in roughly six weeks and I will provide an update after that appointment (or sooner if there are changes).

Please let me know if the school would like a formal written accommodation plan or any additional documentation. I appreciate your support in helping Ethan remain engaged and comfortable at school.

Warm regards,
