Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out on behalf of the Bright Futures Foundation to share an exciting new initiative we believe aligns closely with Helping Hands Alliance’s mission: the “Read to Succeed” literacy program.

Program Snapshot
• Goal: Improve reading proficiency for 500 elementary students across three underserved districts this academic year.  
• Components: After-school tutoring, weekend reading clubs, and free take-home book bundles.  
• Community Impact: Projected 20% increase in participating students’ reading scores by year-end.

Funding Needs & Collaboration
We are currently securing $60,000 to cover instructional materials, volunteer training, and program evaluation. Given Helping Hands Alliance’s commitment to educational equity, we would be honored to explore a partnership—whether through direct funding, in-kind resources, or volunteer engagement.

Next Steps
I’ve prepared a detailed proposal (budget, timeline, and impact metrics) in Notion for your review. At your convenience, please check the link below:

Could we schedule a brief call next week to discuss potential collaboration? Please let me know a few time slots that work for you, or feel free to place a tentative meeting on my calendar.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to empower young readers. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,
