Hi Mark,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the recent user-interface enhancements—I appreciate the detailed feedback. I’ve also reviewed my Debug Diary on Notion to ensure I’m up to speed on the latest usability insights.

To make sure our next steps align with your findings, could you please send over:

• The specific metrics you used to identify the onboarding drop-off points.
• Any engagement data broken down by device type from the most recent release.
• Your suggested priority order (and timeline, if possible) for the UI mock-ups you’d like us to iterate on first.

Once I have these details, I can tailor the design proposals accordingly and coordinate with the dev team to start prototyping.

Feel free to upload the data to the shared analytics folder, or let me know if you’d prefer a brief call instead.

Thanks again for your collaboration!

Best,
Jane Smith
Software Developer, TechSolutions
