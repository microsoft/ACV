Hi [Name],

I’ve just uploaded the complete package you requested to the shared “Terminal Upgrade” Notion workspace:

• Final Technical Specification Pack (PDF) – updated placement drawings, mounting details, power and network requirements  
• Network Integration Sheet – VLAN 312 & 314 allocations, reserved IP range 10.44.58.0/24, and the switch-port map  
• Secure Access & Certificate Procedure v2.1 – step-by-step guide for requesting device certificates and performing the initial login (the one-time password will be issued to your registered lead engineer via Heathrow’s Secrets Manager)  
• Site Safety & Out-of-Hours Protocol – revised May 2025  
• Construction Milestones Extract – scanner-related gate-closure windows for Phases 2–3

Everything is in the folder “04 – Biometric Scanner Installation”. Please let me know if anyone on your team still needs workspace access; I can add them immediately.

If you’d prefer local copies, let me know and I’ll push a zip archive to our secure transfer portal.

Delivery timeline: all documents are available now; please confirm that you can access them so we can lock in equipment shipment for Week 26.

Happy to answer any questions.

Best regards,
