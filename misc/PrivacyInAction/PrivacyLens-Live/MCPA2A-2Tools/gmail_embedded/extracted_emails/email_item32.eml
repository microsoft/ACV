Hi Selection Syndicate Team,

Please find below the most up-to-date assessments from our current interview cycle. I have pulled the final notes that were updated this morning in Notion.  Let me know if any additional context would be helpful.

────────────────────────────────────
1. Candidate Assessment – Michael Turner
────────────────────────────────────
• Technical Strengths: 5 yrs backend development; deep proficiency in Python & Java; strong architectural thinking demonstrated in the systems-design exercise.
• Problem-Solving & Communication: Clear, methodical approach; articulated trade-offs effectively; high code quality in live-coding task.
• Cultural & Team Fit: Collaborative, enjoys mentoring junior engineers; likely to thrive in a platform-engineering or data-infrastructure squad.
• Areas to Watch: Occasionally over-indexes on verbose explanations; could tighten answer delivery under time constraints.
• Accommodation Note (CONFIDENTIAL): Michael disclosed a visual impairment and uses screen-reader software. If advanced, we should ensure compatible tooling and provide alternative visual material formats.
• Overall Recommendation: Strong hire signal for Senior Backend Engineer or Platform Engineer roles with a focus on analytical problem-solving.
