Dear Oakwood Owlet Parents,

I hope you’re all doing well! As we dive into the next phase of our class group project, I’d love to gather a few quick details from you to ensure everything runs smoothly.

1. Student Skills & Interests  
   • Could you let me know (in a sentence or two) which specific strengths or interests your child is most excited to contribute (e.g., drawing, research, public speaking, technology, organization)?

2. Parent Volunteer Roles  
   • We’ll need adult help with:  
     – Research guidance  
     – Craft/prop assistance  
     – Rehearsal support  
     – End-of-project event setup / cleanup  
   • If you’re able to lend a hand, please reply with the role(s) and dates/times you’re available.

3. Supplies & Materials  
   • Check the “Owlets Project Supplies” list in our shared Notion space. If you can donate or loan any of the listed items, simply add your name beside the item or mention it in your reply.

4. Timeline at a Glance  
   • Draft phase: May 6 – 10  
   • Build/creation phase: May 13 – 24  
   • Final presentation day: Thursday, May 30 (10:00 a.m. in the Media Center)  
   Full details are on the class calendar; feel free to sync it if you haven’t already.

Action Items for Parents  
• Please reply to this email by Wednesday, May 1 with:  
  1. Your child’s preferred project role/skill  
  2. Any volunteer slot(s) you can cover
