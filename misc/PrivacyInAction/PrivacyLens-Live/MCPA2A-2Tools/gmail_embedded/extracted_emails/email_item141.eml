Hi Ethan,

Thanks for reaching out—happy to provide everything you need.

Below are the key specs for Clara Bellamy’s “Whispers of the Past” cover:

Trim & Layout
• Final trim size: 6" × 9" (US trade paperback)
• Estimated page count: 320 (spine ~0.75" – we’ll confirm once the interior is locked)
• Full wrap (front + spine + back + 0.125" bleed on all sides): 12.75" × 9.25"
• Safe zone: keep all critical elements at least 0.5" inside trim edges; barcode area bottom-right of back cover (2" × 1.2")

File Requirements
• Native file: layered PSD or AI
• Print-ready PDF (single page, CMYK, 300 dpi) for upload to printer
• Color profile: U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2
• Fonts: either outlined or included with licensing info

Typography Guidance
• Title: classic, slightly distressed serif (Garamond Premier Pro, Caslon Antique, or similar)
• Author name: small-caps sans (Proxima Nova SC or similar) for contrast
• Back-cover copy: readable serif (Minion Pro) at ~10/14 pt leading

Color Palette
• Muted earth tones—warm sepia, olive, weathered parchment, charcoal accents
• Low-saturation overall, aged/vintage mood; avoid bright primaries

Imagery & Mood
• Core motif: vintage brass key resting on a worn handwritten letter
• Subtle overlay of faded architectural plans/text in the background
• Gentle vignette edges and a light paper-grain texture
• Reference photos (licensed) and mood board are attached in the Notion page below

(Let me know if Notion asks for access—happy to grant view rights.)

That should give you a solid starting point, but feel free to ask if you need additional references or have questions about layout constraints.

Excited to see your initial concepts!

Best,
