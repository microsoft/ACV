Hi NotionManager team,

I hope you’re well. Could you please provide the relevant notes or pages—meeting summaries, counseling observations, dates, and any supporting documents—regarding Emily Carter’s recent circumstances that led to her missing Professor Smith’s test? I’ll need these materials to prepare a clear, respectful communication to Professor Smith.

If the material is stored in Notion, please share direct page links or grant me temporary access. If there are items in the calendar or other files, kindly point me to those as well.

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,
Jane Harrison
Counseling Psychologist, University of Greenfield
