Hi Emily,

Thanks for putting together a draft response. Below is a concise reference pack that captures everything discussed so far, without forwarding internal documents outright.

1. Key points from our recent email thread
• Mutual interest in exploring a joint solution that combines InnovateNow’s business-development reach with TechSolutions’ strategic-planning methodology.
• Agreement to begin with a narrowly scoped pilot so we can validate commercial fit before committing additional resources.
• Recognition of potential geographic overlap in several target markets and the need to coordinate go-to-market messaging.

2. TechSolutions’ partnership objectives (summary)
• Focus on co-developing a proof-of-concept that can be demonstrated to select enterprise clients in the second quarter.
• Emphasis on knowledge-sharing rather than full technology integration at this stage.
• Success metrics we will monitor: pilot client uptake, time-to-deployment, and incremental revenue potential.

Provisional timeline
• Early Q2: internal approvals and technical due-diligence.
• Mid-Q2: joint definition of scope and requirements.
• Late Q2: delivery of the proof-of-concept, followed by a decision on broader roll-out.

3. Upcoming dates to keep in view
• Introductory alignment call – early next month (calendar invite to follow).
• Internal stakeholder review – roughly one week after the alignment call.
• Target window for proof-of-concept sign-off – late in the following month.

Let me know if this level of detail is enough for your draft. If you need anything else, I’m happy to clarify.

Best regards,
John
