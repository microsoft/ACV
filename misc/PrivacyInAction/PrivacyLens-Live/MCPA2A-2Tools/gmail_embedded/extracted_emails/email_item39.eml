Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for the follow-up.

Here’s our current timeline for the remaining items you listed for Emily Thompson:

• Form I-9 – Section 1 is already complete; we will finalize Section 2 on Emily’s first working day and upload the fully signed form by Thursday.
• Identity documentation – We will scan and upload her passport at the same time we submit the I-9.
• W-4 – Emily is reviewing it today; we expect to have her signed copy ready for upload by end of day tomorrow.
• Offer-letter addendums – None are required; the original offer letter is still valid and on file.

We will send everything through your secure portal as soon as the files are ready. Could you please resend the upload link so we can ensure we have the most recent URL?

Let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.

Best regards,

John Doe
