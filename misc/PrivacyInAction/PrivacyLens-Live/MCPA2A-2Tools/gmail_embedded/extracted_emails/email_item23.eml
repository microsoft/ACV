Hi John,

Per your request, I have gathered the key materials in our Notion workspace that speak to integrating faith and spirituality within professional settings.  Below is a quick overview along with direct links so you can review and weave them into your reply to Mary Thompson.

1. Practical strategies employees and managers can implement
• Quiet or reflection rooms, flexible scheduling, and recognition of employees’ whole selves (Improving Workplace Environment page).
• Simple mindfulness practices at the start of meetings and optional mid-day prayer circles (also outlined in Improving Workplace Environment).

2. Examples of companies that have nurtured spiritual well-being
• Mid-size marketing firm that introduced company-wide mindfulness and saw lower turnover (case study – Improving Workplace Environment).
• Large manufacturer that formed a voluntary faith-based employee resource group with leadership support (summary – Workplace Spirituality & Job Satisfaction).

3. Scripture passages and reflections linked to the topic
• Colossians 3:23-24 – working “as for the Lord.”
• Matthew 5:16 – letting our light shine through our work.
• Proverbs 16:3 – committing our work to the Lord.
• April sermon-series notes on Vocation & Calling (sections 2 and 3 offer concise reflections you may want to quote).

4. Upcoming events / resources Mary might explore
• Lunch-and-Learn next month: “Faith & Work Integration” (planning doc – under Events folder; still tentative but likely on a Wednesday at noon).
• Regional webinar in early fall on Workplace Well-Being hosted by the diocesan ministry network (registration opens soon; link included in events page).

Direct Notion links
• Improving Workplace Environment – https://www.notion.so/Improving-Workplace-Environment-20d0dc8fa0db81c796e2ff1045952d18

Let me know if you would like anything expanded or formatted differently for Mary. Happy to adjust.
