Hi [Your Name],

Absolutely—here is the most up-to-date information you can share with our alumni:

Notion page
Applicant Statistics Summary  ➜  https://www.notion.so/Applicant-Statistics-Summary-20c0dc8fa0db81a6ada5fb12f5e73ab5  (Admissions workspace > Current Cycle)

Headline numbers (as of the last update – June 8):
• 5,000 total applications submitted for the coming academic year
• Average SAT: 1,420   |   Average ACT: 32
• Applicants represent more than 100 countries and all 50 U.S. states – highlighting the university’s continued global reach and domestic breadth

Key dates to keep on the alumni radar:
• Early Action application deadline – 1 November 2025  
• Priority scholarship consideration deadline – 1 December 2025  
• Regular Decision application deadline – 15 January 2026  
• First round of admission decisions released – late-December (EA) / 31 March 2026 (RD)

All figures and dates above are reflected on the Notion page and will auto-update as new data rolls in. Feel free to lift any chart or bullet point directly, and let me know if you would like additional context (first-gen applicants, top intended majors, yield projections, etc.).

Thanks for pulling the update together for our alumni community—let me know if there’s anything else I can dig up.

Best regards,
John
Alumni Relations Coordinator
