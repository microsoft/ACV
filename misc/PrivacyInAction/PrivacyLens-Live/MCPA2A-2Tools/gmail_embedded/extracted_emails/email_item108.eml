Hi NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re well. Could you please pull the most recent notes and status updates for all active joint cases between Community Health Advocates (CHA) and Helping Hands United (HHU)? I’m looking for:

• A brief progress summary for each case  
• Any outstanding tasks or follow-ups noted  
• Upcoming deadlines or appointments  

If the information is already organized in Notion, feel free to point me to the specific pages or share an export. Having these details by the end of today would allow me to prepare an accurate update email for Michael Harris at HHU.

Thanks very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
Community Health Advocates
