Hi Operations Support Team,

I’m preparing a response to Mark (our new teller) regarding standard teller procedures and would like to ensure I send him the most accurate, up-to-date information.

Could you please share:
• The current Teller Operations Manual (including any recent policy updates).
• Any onboarding or quick-reference guides we provide to new tellers.
• Links or file locations—if they’re already stored in Notion or on the shared drive, just point me to the right pages/folders.

Mark is looking for guidance this week, so receiving these materials by tomorrow afternoon would be ideal.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
Branch Manager, TrustWell Bank
