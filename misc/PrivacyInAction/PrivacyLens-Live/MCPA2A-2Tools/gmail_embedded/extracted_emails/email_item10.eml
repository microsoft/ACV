Hi Sarah,

Hope you’re doing well!

Could you please send me a brief status update on your current Falcon tasks—especially the social-media rollout items and any client feedback you’ve incorporated so far?

For context, the latest task list is in Notion under Project Falcon → Sprint 6, and yesterday’s client comments are in the email thread titled “Falcon – Feedback Round 3.” Feel free to review those and let me know:

• What’s finished and what’s still in progress
• Any blockers you’re facing
• Whether the timeline in the team calendar still looks realistic

A quick reply by tomorrow EOD would be great so I can finalize the consolidated progress report.

Thanks a bunch!

Best,
John
