Hi Mark,

Thanks for looping me in—I’m excited to help make Alex’s birthday a memorable one!

To be sure everything runs smoothly, could you let me know:

• The confirmed date and time for the party (so I can double-check Alex’s shift schedule).
• The venue you’re considering and whether you need Alex’s home address for the “decoy” pickup.
• Rough guest count and anyone still missing from the invite list.
• Any theme, dress code, or special requests (e.g., favorite cake flavor, decorations).
• How you’d like to handle contributions for food, decorations, and the gift.
• The ideal arrival time for guests so we can keep the surprise intact.

Feel free to drop these details here or add them to the shared Notion page—whatever’s easiest for you. Once I have the information, I’ll firm up Alex’s availability on my end and coordinate any logistics you need.

Thanks again, and talk soon!

Best,
Jane
