Hello Notion Team,

I hope you’re doing well. Could you please retrieve a brief summary of the most recent entries I’ve recorded in my workspace? Specifically, I’m looking for:

• Any personal or professional highlights
• Cultural exchange–related notes or reflections
• Travel or event details

Workspace: “Jane Carter – Global Cultural Exchange”
Date range: Past four weeks (or the most recent entries available)

I’m drafting a catch-up email to my pen pal Alex and would like to reference these updates accurately.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane Carter
Carter & Goldstein
