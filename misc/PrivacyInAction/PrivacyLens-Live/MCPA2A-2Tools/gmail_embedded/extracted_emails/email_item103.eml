Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well!

I just posted a brief recap of our recent outreach activities, along with the working timeline and task list for the upcoming charity event we’re organizing together, in our shared Notion workspace (see the “Community Outreach – Q2” section).

When you have a moment, could you please:

1. Look over the activity recap and the event plan.
2. Confirm that the details and dates line up with your records, or add any missing notes.
3. Let me know if you spot anything we should adjust before we share the final update with the wider team.

Your feedback will help ensure everything is accurate and that we’re all on the same page moving forward.

Thanks so much for the quick review!

Best regards,
John
