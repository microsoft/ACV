Hi team,

I’m drafting our formal reply to Mr. Thompson (thompson.gov@email.com) regarding Grandview’s disability-accommodation practices and need to reference the most up-to-date information. Could you please point me to—or grant me view access to—the Notion pages that cover:

• Current academic, housing, and technology accommodations  
• Eligibility/application workflow and approval timelines  
• Recent usage statistics or case numbers (if available)  
• Upcoming improvements or initiatives slated for the next academic year  

Having these details today (ideally by end-of-day) will ensure our response is complete and compliant with federal requirements.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
John
Professor & ADA Liaison, Grandview University
