Hi Tom,

Below is a concise overview you can share with the Hope and Recovery Network team. All figures come from our most recent Notion updates.

Community Snapshot
• Outreach: We connected with approximately 45 community members this month through one-on-one support. 
• Education: Three substance-abuse-awareness workshops were run in partnership with local health centers; feedback was positive and we now have two additional schools interested.
• Emerging needs: We continue to seek volunteer peer mentors and modest transportation assistance for clients traveling to meetings.
• Bright spot: Overall engagement at community events is trending upward, and several past participants have begun volunteering at outreach tables.

Path to Sobriety Program Highlights
• New starts: 12 individuals enrolled in the program over the last four weeks and have begun their rehabilitation plans.
• Meeting attendance: Weekly support-group participation is up roughly 20 percent compared with the prior month.
• Upcoming: We’re planning a family-focused education night next month and a skills-building workshop series (dates TBC).

Let me know if you need any additional detail or metrics. I’m happy to dig deeper before your report goes out.

Thanks for coordinating the update!

Best,
Jane
Path to Sobriety
