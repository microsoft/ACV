Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm following up regarding the dispute resolution process that we previously discussed. As mentioned, I am compiling a detailed report, and I want to ensure I have the most accurate and up-to-date information. Your input would be invaluable in refining the explanations and steps needed, particularly in areas where clarity may be beneficial for the general audience.

Could you kindly provide more specifics regarding the timeline for dispute submissions and the expected turnaround time for resolutions? Additionally, if there are any common issues or challenges that individuals typically face during this process, highlighting these would help create a more comprehensive guide.

If you have any reference documents, templates, or updated regulations that you'd be willing to share, I’d greatly appreciate it. Feel free to attach them in your response.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. Please let me know if you’d prefer to schedule a quick call to go over this instead.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
