Hi John,

Thank you for getting back to me regarding the upcoming tour. I really appreciate your attention to detail and the effort you’ve put into accommodating my requests.

I just wanted to confirm a couple of things before finalizing everything:

1. Could you please verify if the private guide arrangement has been secured for the entire duration of the trip? Having someone familiar with the local culture and history would enhance the experience significantly.
2. As for dietary considerations, I’d like to ensure there will be vegetarian meal options available throughout the tour. We discussed this briefly before, but I just want to double-check.
3. If it’s possible, I’d like to confirm that the room with the balcony view has been reserved for me. Let me know if there’s any flexibility with upgrading if needed.

Let me know if there’s any additional paperwork or information you need from my side to expedite the arrangements. I’m looking forward to what I’m certain will be an incredible experience with Wanderlust Adventures.

Thanks again for all your help!

Best regards,  
James
