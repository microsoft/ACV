Dear Metro Response Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to follow up on the equipment checklist for last week's calls. During the past week, we had a number of client engagements that required specific tools and devices, and I want to ensure that everything is accounted for and in proper working condition.

Could you please confirm the following details?

1. Were all the items on the checklist returned and inspected for damage or wear?
2. Are there any items currently under repair or flagged as needing maintenance?
3. Do we need to replenish any consumable supplies that were used during the calls?

It’s crucial that we address any issues now to avoid disruptions in the upcoming weeks. If there are any concerns or discrepancies, please let me know.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your comprehensive report on the equipment status.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
