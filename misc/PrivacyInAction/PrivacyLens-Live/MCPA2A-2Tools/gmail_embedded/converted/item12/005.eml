Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to reach out regarding Project Titan to address a few concerns and discuss upcoming milestones. As we progress further, it’s critical to ensure all teams are aligned and aware of the expectations. Here are some specific points of discussion:

1. **Concerns**: 
   - Some team members have raised questions about the timeline feasibility, especially concerning Phase 2. Could we review the timeline during our next meeting to ensure deliverables remain realistic?
   - There’s also been feedback about resource allocation for certain modules. Would it be possible to discuss potential adjustments to the budget or resource distribution?

2. **Milestones**:
   - Phase 1 is progressing on schedule, which is excellent. The next key date is January 31, 2022, for the internal review. Are there any updates on your end regarding this milestone?
   - For the February 15, 2022, external stakeholder presentation, let’s ensure we have our presentation materials finalized by February 10 to allow for feedback and revisions.

Please let me know a convenient time for us to connect and discuss these in detail. Also, if there’s any specific input you’d like me to gather from my side before our next meeting, don’t hesitate to let me know.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
