Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to connect regarding the objectives alignment for Project Titan. As we move forward into the next phase, it’s crucial for us to ensure that all teams are aligned on the key milestones and deliverables. This will help us maintain momentum and stay on track with our timelines.

Could you please take some time to review the latest objectives document I shared last week and let me know if you foresee any potential challenges or additional resources your team might need? Additionally, we should schedule a quick call this week to address any questions and solidify our plans.

Please let me know what time works best for you, and I’ll adjust my schedule accordingly.

Thanks for your cooperation and support.

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson
