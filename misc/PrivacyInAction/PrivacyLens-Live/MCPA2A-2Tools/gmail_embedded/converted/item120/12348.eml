Dear Legal Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring your attention to some recent updates regarding tax regulations that may impact our operations. These changes were announced last week and are scheduled to take effect starting March 1, 2022. It is imperative that we review these updates in detail and determine how they align with Sterling Co.'s compliance policies.

A few points of concern that I believe are worth reviewing:
1. Adjustments in corporate tax rates for the 2022 fiscal year.
2. Changes to allowable deductions for business expenses.
3. New reporting requirements for overseas transactions exceeding $100,000.

Please let me know if we can set up a time to discuss these updates and strategize how to ensure full compliance. Additionally, it might be beneficial to loop in the Finance team for a collaborative review.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,  
John Doe
