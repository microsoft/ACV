# Immigrant Aid Society Workshop Planning

Finalized the workshop schedule for the Immigrant Aid Society. The workshops are designed to educate new immigrants on their rights and the legal process. Dates are set for March 1st, 3rd, and 5th. Need to send this to Maria so she can distribute the information.
