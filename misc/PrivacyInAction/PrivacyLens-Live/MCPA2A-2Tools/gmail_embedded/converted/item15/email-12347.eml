Dear Jane Doe,

I hope this email finds you well.

We are currently reviewing the data files you provided for the upcoming analysis, and I had a few questions regarding the format of certain sections. Specifically, we noticed some inconsistencies in the way the genetic markers were categorized in columns 5 and 6 of the dataset. Could you please clarify if this variation was intentional or if we should proceed with a standard normalization for these markers?

Additionally, we’d like to confirm if the mutation identifiers in column 8 are aligned with the GenetiCore Mutation Reference Database version 3.2, as this is the version our system is currently configured to use.

Your clarification on these matters would greatly aid in ensuring the accuracy and alignment of our analysis. Please let us know at your earliest convenience if further adjustments are needed on your end or ours.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need additional context concerning our observations.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
