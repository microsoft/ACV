Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Mark Harrison, and I am reaching out from the University of Technology's Department of Computer Science. I came across your work recently, and I was truly impressed by your innovative approach to data visualization in large-scale systems. 

At the university, we are currently working on a research project that involves developing new methodologies for analyzing and presenting complex datasets. Based on what I’ve seen of your expertise, I believe there could be a great opportunity for us to collaborate on this initiative. Your unique perspective and skills could bring significant value to our team and the project's success.

If this sounds interesting to you, I’d love to schedule a time to discuss it further. Please let me know your availability in the coming weeks, and we can arrange a meeting—either virtually or in person, depending on your preference.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Mark Harrison
