Dear Legal Aid Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the "Know Your Rights Forum" community workshop that is being organized. I recently came across the announcement and would like to know more details about the event, including the date, time, location, and if there are any registration requirements. 

As a local community member, I am very interested in attending and learning more about how to better understand and protect our rights. Additionally, if there are opportunities to volunteer during the event or ways to spread the word, I would be happy to assist.

Looking forward to your response and thank you for your efforts in organizing such an important initiative.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
