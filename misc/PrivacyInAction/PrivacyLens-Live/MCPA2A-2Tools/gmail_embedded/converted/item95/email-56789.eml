Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to inform you about our upcoming software upgrade, which we believe will bring significant improvements to your experience with our products and services.

We’d like to schedule a discussion to share more details about the upgrade, including key changes, how it will impact your current setup, and the steps needed to ensure a smooth transition. This session will also provide an opportunity for you to ask any questions or raise specific concerns.

Please let us know your availability in the upcoming week, and we’ll do our best to accommodate your schedule. If you have any preliminary questions or require further information before our discussion, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your continued partnership, and we’re excited to take this next step with you.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,  
The CodeCrafters Inc. Team
