# Book Cover Design Brief - Whispers of the Past

The book cover for 'Whispers of the Past' should evoke a sense of mystery and nostalgia. The main elements to include are an old, ornate key and a faded letter. The color scheme should be muted earth tones. Please refer to the attached synopsis and author bio for more context on the themes of the story.
