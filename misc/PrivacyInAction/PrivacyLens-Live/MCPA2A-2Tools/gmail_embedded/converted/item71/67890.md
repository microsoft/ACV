# Class Performance on 'Read to Succeed'

The aggregate data from this semester's essay submissions for the 'Read to Succeed' project shows a noticeable trend in literacy improvement across the class. The average reading comprehension score has increased by 15% since the beginning of the semester. This data could be useful for the Bright Futures Foundation to understand the impact of their program on student literacy levels.
