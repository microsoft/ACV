Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well! As part of our ongoing efforts to stay aligned and collaborate effectively, I wanted to check in and schedule our monthly collaboration meeting. 

The agenda for this month will include:
- Updates on existing projects
- Discussion on new initiatives for Q1
- Addressing any challenges or blockers
- Setting goals for the upcoming month

Please let me know what date and time work best for you, and I’ll coordinate accordingly. If there’s anything specific you’d like to add to the agenda, feel free to share your suggestions as well!

Looking forward to catching up and continuing our productive partnership.

Best regards,  
Jane
