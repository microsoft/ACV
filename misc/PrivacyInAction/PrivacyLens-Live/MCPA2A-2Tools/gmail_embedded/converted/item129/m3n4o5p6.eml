Hi Mark,

Thank you for your prompt response regarding the Resource Sharing Agreement. I really appreciate your willingness to collaborate on this initiative. 

After reviewing the initial terms, I'd like to propose incorporating specific timelines for resource allocation. This will ensure that we can track progress effectively and also address any potential challenges proactively. If you’re open to this, I’d be happy to draft a section with suggested dates and milestones for your review.

Additionally, I’m available for a quick call or meeting next week to discuss this further and finalize the agreement details. Please let me know your availability, and I can adjust accordingly.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Jane
