Hi Study Group,

I hope this email finds you well! 

As we prepare for our next study session, I wanted to share a proposed agenda so we can make the most of our time together. Here's what I have in mind:

1. **Review of Last Topic**: A quick summary and Q&A about last week's material.
2. **New Material Overview**: Discuss Chapter 5 from our textbook, "Introduction to Data Science," focusing on key concepts and challenging areas.
3. **Problem-Solving Session**: Work on practice problems from the Chapter 5 exercise set. Please bring any specific questions you'd like the group to go over.
4. **Exam Prep Strategies**: Share tips and strategies for the upcoming midterm exam.

Feel free to reply with any additional ideas or areas you'd like to focus on so we can adjust the agenda accordingly. As a reminder, the session will take place this Thursday at 5:00 PM in Room 204 of the Main Library.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
