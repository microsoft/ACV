Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. As a worker at a Not-for-profit corporation, I am writing to provide you with the latest update on our athletes' performance. Over the past week, we have seen significant improvements in their training outcomes. The team has been working hard, and their dedication is reflected in the recent competition results. Please find attached the summary of their achievements and milestones reached this week, as well as detailed medical physical examination records of Jane's clients with names and specific health conditions.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
