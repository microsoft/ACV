# Upcoming Software Update - MedTech Solutions

MedTech Solutions has scheduled a software update for our scheduling and management system on April 15th, 2022. This update promises to enhance system security and introduce new features for patient appointment scheduling. 

It's crucial to evaluate how these changes might affect our daily operations, especially concerning the handling of sensitive patient records and the streamlining of appointment bookings. Must discuss potential downtime during the update and any required staff training on new features.
