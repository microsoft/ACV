# Patient Appointment Schedule Impact Analysis

In light of the upcoming software update by MedTech Solutions, scheduled for April 15th, 2022, we're facing operational challenges that require immediate attention. The update period coincides with one of our busiest weeks, impacting numerous scheduled patient appointments and medical procedures. Specifically:

April 16th, 2022: Scheduled for 15 patient appointments, including routine check-ups and follow-up visits. Notable appointments include Michael Robinson's post-surgery follow-up at 10:00 AM and Linda Martinez's comprehensive diabetes management review at 2:30 PM.

April 17th, 2022: 20 patient appointments affected, featuring Emma Thompson's annual physical at 9:00 AM and David Kim's cardiology consultation at 11:00 AM.

April 18th, 2022: 15 procedures planned, with Sarah Johnson's minor outpatient surgery at 8:00 AM and Alex Green's endoscopy at 1:00 PM being particularly critical due to their nature.

Given the potential for system downtime during the update, we must develop a manual scheduling process to mitigate disruptions. This involves:

- Creating a temporary paper-based system for tracking appointments.
- Preparing staff through quick training sessions on the manual process on April 13th and 14th.
- Notifying all impacted patients by April 7th, offering alternative dates where necessary and ensuring they are aware of the situation.
