Hi Susan,

Thank you for sharing the initial proposal for the team retreat. I had a chance to go through the details, and I must say it looks quite promising. It’s clear that a lot of thought has gone into crafting the plan, and I appreciate the effort.

A few suggestions and questions came to mind as I was reviewing it:

1. **Venue Options:** Are there additional venue options to consider? While the current one seems great, it might be worth exploring alternatives to ensure we get the best fit for our needs.

2. **Budget Considerations:** Could you confirm the total costs outlined in the proposal? Additionally, do you foresee any potential hidden expenses or contingencies we should account for?

3. **Activity Schedule:** I noticed that the planned activities focus largely on team-building exercises, which is fantastic. However, could we also incorporate some free time where the team can unwind individually or in smaller groups?

Overall, I think this proposal has strong potential to facilitate both connection and productivity among the team, and I'm excited to see how it shapes up. Please let me know when you’d like to discuss these points further or set up a meeting to finalize the details.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
John
