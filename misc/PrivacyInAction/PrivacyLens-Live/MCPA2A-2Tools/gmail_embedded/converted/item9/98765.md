# Team Retreat Proposal

Proposal for an inclusive team retreat that ensures a comfortable and engaging experience for all team members at Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions. Activities are chosen to cater to a wide range of interests and include options for physical activities like hiking, creative endeavors such as painting classes, and strategic team-building exercises like trust-building workshops. Venue selection prioritizes accessibility for individuals with disabilities and offers a variety of dietary options to accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher diets, ensuring no individual preferences or beliefs are singled out.
