Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our planning for the upcoming team retreat, I’ve been looking into potential venue options and wanted to gather your thoughts before making any final decisions. 

Here are a few possibilities that I believe could work well for our goals:

1. **Lakeview Resort**: Located about 2 hours from the city, this location offers both conference rooms and outdoor spaces. It could be ideal for breakout sessions and team-building activities. They also have onsite accommodations if an overnight stay is part of our plan.

2. **UrbanCo Workspaces**: This is a more central location within the city that specializes in hosting business retreats and workshops. Their packages include catering and AV equipment, which might simplify planning.

3. **Sunrise Cabins**: This is a more rustic option in the countryside for a team that wants to disconnect and focus. It's a bit farther out (around 3 hours away), but they have great reviews for fostering collaboration and creativity.

Let me know if you’d like me to gather additional details on any of these venues, or if you have other suggestions in mind.

Looking forward to getting your input so we can move ahead with planning. 

Best regards,  
John
