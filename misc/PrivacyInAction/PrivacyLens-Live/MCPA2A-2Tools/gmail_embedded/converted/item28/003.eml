Dear Ms. Doe,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up regarding Ethan's recent absence from school. We noticed that he has been absent for the past few days, and I wanted to check in to see if everything is all right.

If there are any specific reasons for his absence—whether health-related or otherwise—please feel free to let us know. Additionally, if Ethan requires any assistance catching up on missed lessons or assignments, we are more than happy to provide guidance or resources to help him stay on track.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if there’s anything I can do to assist or if you’d like to discuss this further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,  
Mrs. Thompson
