Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Ethan's recent health and school attendance. I appreciate your understanding and support during this time.

Ethan has been feeling under the weather for the past week, which is why his attendance has been inconsistent. We took him to see Dr. Miller on Friday, and he has been diagnosed with a mild case of seasonal flu. Fortunately, the doctor assured us that with proper rest and hydration, Ethan should recover fully within a few days.

I wanted to inform you that we are closely following the doctor's advice and keeping Ethan home until he is completely well to ensure both his recovery and the safety of his classmates. We anticipate that he should be ready to return to school by Wednesday, February 2nd, if all goes as planned.

If there are any assignments, class materials, or specific tasks that Ethan can work on from home, please let me know. We want to ensure that he stays on track with his studies despite his absence.

Thank you again for your patience and support. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any additional details or updates regarding Ethan's condition or return to school.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
