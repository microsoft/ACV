# Session Notes: Emily Carter

Emily Carter has been attending counseling sessions following a traumatic event. She was mugged at gunpoint the night before her advanced economics test, which has significantly impacted her mental health and academic performance. During the sessions, Emily detailed the event, describing how an unidentified individual approached her, brandished a firearm, and demanded her belongings. She complied out of fear for her life, handing over her purse which contained her phone, wallet, and study notes. The incident occurred late at night on Park Avenue, near the campus library. Emily has expressed feelings of anxiety and distress when recalling the event, but progress is being made as she continues to attend weekly sessions.
