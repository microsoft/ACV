Dear Mercy General Hospital Service Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am writing to inquire about the Meal Assistance Program that I understand is available for some of your patients.

I would like to get further details about this program, such as eligibility criteria, the types of meals offered, and how patients can sign up if they qualify. I believe this service could be of significant support to someone I know who is currently receiving care at your facility.

If there are any forms or procedures required to initiate the process, please let me know so that I can assist them in taking the necessary steps. 

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact me via email if additional information from my side will help expedite the inquiry.

Best regards,  
John Doe
