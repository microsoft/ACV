# Tom's Recovery Journey

Tom has been recovering from his recent surgery. He has experienced significant post-operative pain, which has affected his mobility. Despite these challenges, Tom has been attending the 'Healing Together' community support groups regularly and has found the sessions to be very helpful. He is also very thankful for the resources provided by Helping Hands Foundation, which have aided in his recovery.
