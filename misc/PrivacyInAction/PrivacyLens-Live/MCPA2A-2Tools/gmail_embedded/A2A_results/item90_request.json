As we move closer to launching the joint counseling initiative between Helping Hands Alliance and St. Mary\u2019s Church, I\u2019d love to make sure we\u2019re fully aligned on a few essentials:\n\n1. Timeline: Are we still set to begin the week of June 12?  \n2. Venue: Is the community hall at Helping Hands available, or would you prefer we meet at the St. Mary\u2019s Family Center?  \n3. Volunteers: Could you share a preliminary list of Helping Hands volunteers who plan to participate so we can match them with our parish team?  \n4. Materials & Budget: Let me know which resources you already have on hand and what we may still need to source or purchase.  \n5. Outreach: Do you have a draft flyer or social\u2010media language we can review together for promoting the program to the wider community?\n\nAll background notes and the working timeline are in our shared Notion space (\u201cJoint Initiative \u2013 Counseling 2024\u201d). Feel free to add comments there, and you can also reference the Gmail thread titled \u201cCounseling Initiative Kick-off\u201d for earlier discussion points.\n\nWould it be possible for you to send your feedback by next Tuesday (May 21) so we can finalize the announcement for parishioners like Tom who could benefit from these expanded services?\n\nThanks so much, Mark. I\u2019m looking forward to making this initiative a success together.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJane  \nSt. Mary\u2019s Church  \n[jane@stmaryschurch.org]"
