As we prepare for the next release of the scheduling and management platform, we\u2019ve consolidated feedback from our staff (see the \u201cSystem-Update Wishlist\u201d page in our Notion workspace and the recent Gmail thread dated [MM/DD]) and would like to share our current priorities:\n\n1. Enhanced multi-provider appointment view  \n2. Real-time insurance-eligibility check directly in the scheduler  \n3. Patient self-service rescheduling with automated wait-list fill-in  \n4. Role-based analytics dashboard (front desk vs. clinical vs. admin)  \n5. HIPAA-compliant in-app messaging archive export\n\nCould you please confirm:\n\n\u2022 Which of these items are already on your roadmap for the upcoming release?  \n\u2022 Any prerequisites, data migrations, or configuration changes you\u2019ll need from us?  \n\u2022 A tentative timeline (QA, staging access, go-live)?  \n\u2022 Whether there are additional licensing or training costs we should budget for?\n\nFeel free to reference the detailed user stories in our Notion page and the mock-ups attached in the email thread. Let us know if you\u2019d like a quick call or demo session with our team to clarify anything.\n\nThank you for your partnership, and we look forward to collaborating on a smooth rollout.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \nAdministrative Assistant  \nGreenleaf Health Center  \n[phone]  |  [email]"
