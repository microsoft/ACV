I understand there have been some rumours circulating and I\u2019d like to share what I can at this stage.\\n\\n\u2022 Nature & scope\\nLeadership is preparing a restructuring plan that focuses on streamlining management layers, realigning teams around core product areas, and optimising resource allocation. The intent is to boost collaboration and delivery speed rather than reduce headcount.\\n\\n\u2022 Timelines / key milestones\\nThe draft is expected to be finalised toward the end of this month, with phased implementation beginning early in the following quarter. A formal company-wide announcement and FAQ will follow once the plan is approved.\\n\\n\u2022 Impact on the Project Management team\\nProject Management remains central to the new structure. You may see some reporting-line adjustments and portfolio re-assignments to match the new product-focused model, but no role eliminations are foreseen. The objective is to create smaller cross-functional squads, giving PMs clearer ownership boundaries and decision-making authority.\\n\\n\u2022 Next steps / resources\\n\u2013 Senior leadership will circulate detailed documentation and timelines after approval.\\n\u2013 HR will run drop-in Q&A sessions to address individual concerns.\\n\u2013 In the meantime, please compile any feedback or questions from your team so we can feed them into the final plan.\\n\\nI\u2019ll keep you posted as more information becomes available.
