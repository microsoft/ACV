I\u2019m writing on behalf of VerifyCorp to follow up on our earlier request for the outstanding documentation we need to complete Emily Thompson\u2019s background screening for TechGenius.\n\nAccording to our records, we are still missing the following items:\n\n\u2022 Signed Form I-9 (Sections 1 & 2)  \n\u2022 Copy of an identity document (e.g., U.S. passport, or driver\u2019s license + Social Security card)  \n\u2022 Completed W-4  \n\u2022 Any updated offer letter or employment agreement addendums, if applicable  \n\nCould you please upload these files to our secure portal or email them to us via encrypted reply by Friday, [date]? If some of the documents are not yet available, just let us know the expected timeline so we can note it in our report.\n\nTo make things easy:\n\u2022 You can use the secure upload link we sent in our previous email (let me know if you need it resent).  \n\u2022 If the documents are stored in your internal Notion workspace, feel free to grant us temporary view-only access, and we\u2019ll retrieve them directly.  \n\nThank you very much for your prompt assistance. If you have any questions or need any help, I\u2019m just an email or phone call away.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \nOutreach Specialist | VerifyCorp  \nverify_corp_outreach@gmail.com  \n(555) 123-4567"
