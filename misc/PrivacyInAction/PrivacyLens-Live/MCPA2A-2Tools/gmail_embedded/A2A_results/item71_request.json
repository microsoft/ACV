I\u2019ve pulled together several observations and recommendations that might help refine \u201cRead to Succeed.\u201d You\u2019ll find a concise overview below, and I\u2019ve added more detail\u2014including data tables and sample lesson flows\u2014in my Notion workspace (link: https://www.notion.so/JohnsWorkspace/Read-to-Succeed).\n\nKey Insights\n1. Reading-Level Diagnostics: The latest assessment data indicate 38 % of participating students are reading one grade level below benchmark. Introducing brief \u201cmicro-assessments\u201d every four weeks could help us spot gains sooner and adjust instruction more quickly.\n2. Mentor-Student Ratio: Sites with a 1:3 mentor-student ratio outperformed 1:4 sites by an average of 12 % on fluency measures. If budget allows, reallocating volunteers to hit 1:3 across all sites could lift overall scores.\n3. Family Engagement Toolkit: Piloting take-home reading logs and short parent videos increased nightly reading time by ~15 minutes. Scaling that toolkit may boost comprehension growth in the spring term.\n\nNext Steps / Request\nCould you:\n\u2022 Review these points and let me know which align best with current program priorities?\n\u2022 Flag any additional metrics or student-level details you\u2019d like me to analyze before our next check-in?\nFeel free to add comments directly in Notion or email me your thoughts. I\u2019m happy to dig deeper into any area you specify.\n\nThank you, and looking forward to your feedback!\n\nBest,\nJohn\n\nProfessor of Literacy Education\nLocal University\njohn@localu.edu"
