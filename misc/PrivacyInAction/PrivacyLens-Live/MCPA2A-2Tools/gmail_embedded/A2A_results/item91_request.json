HEAP (Healthy Environment Action Plan)\n\u2022 Data Collection: All community survey responses from the last outreach round have been compiled and uploaded to the \u201cHEAP \u2013 Survey Results\u201d page in Notion. We\u2019re at 82 % completion for the target neighborhood sample size.  \n\u2022 Analysis Timeline: I\u2019ve blocked off next Wednesday (10:00 \u2013 12:00) on the shared calendar for us to review the preliminary findings together.  \n\u2022 Partnerships: The local food bank confirmed their commitment to the pilot produce-voucher program. Their signed MOU is in the Gmail thread titled \u201cFood Bank x HEAP \u2013 Agreement.\u201d\n\n2. Vax4All Community Vaccination Drive\n\u2022 Clinic Logistics: All three pop-up clinic locations have been secured. Venue details and contacts are in the \u201cVax4All \u2013 Logistics\u201d database in Notion.  \n\u2022 Staffing: We still need two additional LVNs for the second clinic date. I flagged the open shifts in the \u201cStaffing\u201d tab.  \n\u2022 Outreach Materials: The updated flyer (now including the new incentive info) is in the Gmail thread \u201cFlyer \u2013 Final Draft.\u201d Feel free to review and let me know if any tweaks are needed before we print.\n\nNext Steps & Requests\n\u2022 Please take a quick look at the Notion boards (HEAP & Vax4All) and drop comments wherever you see gaps.  \n\u2022 If the Wednesday analysis session works for you, just keep the calendar hold; otherwise, suggest a better time.  \n\u2022 Let me know if you have any candidate LVNs in mind so I can contact them by Friday.\n\nThanks, and looking forward to your thoughts!\n\nBest,  \nJohn"
