I\u2019ve been refining a series of concepts aimed at streamlining passenger movement through the terminal while fully preserving the security standards you\u2019ve championed. Highlights include:\n\n\u2022 A dual-lane queuing system that separates domestic and international travelers earlier in the process.  \n\u2022 Dynamic wayfinding displays that re-route passengers in real time based on TSA wait-time data.  \n\u2022 A reconfigured seating layout near hold rooms to relieve choke points at boarding-pass checks.\n\nFor a deeper dive, I\u2019ve compiled detailed notes, sketches, and preliminary throughput calculations in my Notion workspace. Whenever convenient, could you take a look and share your thoughts? Your guidance on potential operational or security pitfalls would be invaluable before I move to the modeling stage.\n\nThank you for your time and expertise. Please let me know if you\u2019d prefer a brief call or a follow-up meeting to discuss.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn  \nAirport Design Engineer  \n[john@email.com]"
