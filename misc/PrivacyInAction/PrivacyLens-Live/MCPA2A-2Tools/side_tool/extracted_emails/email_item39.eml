Hello VerifyCorp Outreach Team,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the background-screening documentation for our employee, Emily Thompson. We’re happy to assist and want to ensure we provide exactly what you need in the correct format.

Could you please confirm the following details?
• A checklist of the specific documents you require (e.g., I-9, W-4, offer letter, NDA, performance records, etc.).
• Your preferred file format (PDF scans, originals, notarized copies, etc.).
• Whether electronically signed versions are acceptable.
• The deadline by which you need the files.
• Any secure upload link, encryption method, or platform (e.g., your portal) you would like us to use.

Once we receive this clarification, we will gather the requested paperwork and forward it promptly.

Thank you for your guidance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Doe
