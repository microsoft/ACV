Hi Mark,

As requested, please find below a concise overview of the latest procurement data covering the last two quarters (FY-2025 Q1–Q2). Detailed documents are available in our shared “Budget Forecast” folder on SharePoint.

• FY25_Q1-Q2_PO_Log.xlsx – full purchase-order ledger (Jan–Jun 2025)
• Active_Supplier_Contracts_June2025.xlsx – contract abstracts + current price lists
• Procurement_Pipeline_July-Sept2025.xlsx – pending/planned commitments

1. Recent Purchase Orders (Jan–Jun 2025)
   • 128 POs issued; total spend ≈ $4.8 M
   • Top categories: electronics components (47 %), machined parts (28 %), packaging (12 %)
   • Major suppliers: A-Tech ($1.3 M), Global Fasteners ($0.9 M), GreenPack ($0.6 M)

2. Current Supplier Contracts & Pricing
   • A-Tech – 3-year agreement through 31-Dec-2026; 2 % annual escalation; Q3 price list uploaded
   • Global Fasteners – 18-month contract; volume-tier discount up to 7 %
   • GreenPack – rolling 12-month MSA; raw-material surcharge clause updated May-2025

4. Price-Change Outlook & Supply-Chain Risks
   • Copper pricing: +6 % since April; expect a further 3-4 % volatility into Q3
   • Resin supply tightening; packaging materials may incur 5-7 % surcharge
   • Ocean freight rates stabilizing; East-Asia lead-time remains 6–8 weeks
   • ERP migrations at A-Tech & PrecisionMold in July could cause short fulfillment delays

Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive or a quick meeting to walk through the numbers. I’ll keep the SharePoint folder updated as new data comes in.

Best regards,
