Hi Thomas,

Thank you for your message.

I’ve compiled the latest aggregated, de-identified performance metrics for the Spring 2025 semester. You can download the spreadsheet here:

Lincoln High School – Aggregated Student Performance (Spring 2025):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/abcdefg (view-only)

The file contains:
• Grade distribution summaries for English, Math, Science, and Social Studies by grade level (9–12).
• Average scores and percentile bands from the March 2025 district benchmark assessments.
• Semester-to-semester growth indicators for each proficiency band (Fall 2024 → Spring 2025).
• A short commentary outlining notable gains (e.g., Algebra I) and areas to monitor (e.g., 11th-grade writing conventions).

No student-level or personally identifiable information is included—all figures are reported in aggregate form.

Please let me know if the link works or if you’d prefer the data in a different format.

Best regards,
