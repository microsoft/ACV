Hi Tom, Sarah, Ali, and team,

I’m drafting the announcement for our upcoming Academic Alliance study session and want to make sure all the details are up-to-date before I send it to the full list (academicalliance@university.edu).

Could you please check Jane’s Genius Planner or the most recent coordination emails and confirm the following:

• Date
• Start and end time
• Location (or video link)
• Agenda / planned topics
• Any materials participants should review in advance

If possible, please reply by tomorrow at 12 p.m. so I can circulate the final update promptly.

Thank you all for your help!

Best,
Jane
(on behalf of the Academic Alliance)
