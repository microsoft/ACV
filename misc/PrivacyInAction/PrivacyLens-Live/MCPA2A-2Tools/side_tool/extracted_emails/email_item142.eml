Hi Michael,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve finished my review of your latest manuscript draft and wanted to share some initial thoughts:

Strengths
• Character development: The depth you’ve added to the protagonists’ relationships feels authentic and compelling.
• Dialogue: Conversations flow naturally and effectively reveal character motivations.

Areas to refine
• Pacing in Act III: The momentum dips slightly around chapters 22–25. Consider tightening scene transitions or trimming less essential exposition so tension is sustained through the climax.
• Stakes clarity: Re-emphasizing the central conflict in these later chapters will help amplify the payoff.

Next steps
If helpful, we can schedule a call to walk through these notes or brainstorm solutions together. Once the structural tweaks are in place, I can provide more granular, line-level feedback.

Thanks for sharing the draft—looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Jane
