Dear Alex,

Thank you for submitting your project for our course. I have finished reviewing it and wanted to share my feedback with you.

Strengths
• You demonstrate a solid understanding of the course material, and the data analysis you conducted is well executed.
• Your presentation of findings is clear, and the visualizations effectively support your argument.

Areas for Improvement
• Consider stating your hypothesis more concisely to sharpen the focus of the paper and guide readers through your analysis.

Overall Assessment
• Grade: B+
• Your work shows considerable promise; with a more tightly framed hypothesis, the project could be even stronger.

Next Steps
If you plan to revise this work for a future presentation or publication, I recommend starting with a single-sentence hypothesis and ensuring each section explicitly ties back to it. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss specific revisions or talk through additional resources.

Thank you again for your hard work on this project. I look forward to seeing your continued growth in the course.

Best regards,
Professor Jane
