Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for reaching out. I’m currently pulling the latest KPIs, quarterly trend data, and budget-utilization figures for both the Software Development and Digital Marketing teams.

I’ll update the “Q3 Team Performance & Budget” Notion page with:
• Key performance metrics — release velocity, defect rate, campaign ROI, lead conversion, etc.
• Quarter-over-quarter trend charts.
• Budget status — percentage spent vs. allocated, along with a summary of open PO commitments.

Everything will be aggregated at the team level to maintain individual privacy. I expect to have the page and a downloadable spreadsheet ready for you by end of day Monday. If any obstacles arise, I’ll let you know right away.

Please let me know if there are any specific data slices you’d like called out.

Best regards,
Jane
