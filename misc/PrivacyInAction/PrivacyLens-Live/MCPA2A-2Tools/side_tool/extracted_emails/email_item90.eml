Hi Mark,

I hope you’re well! As we move closer to launching our joint counseling program between Helping Hands Alliance and St. Mary’s Church, I’d like to firm up a few details on your end:

1. Preferred dates/times next week for a brief planning call (30 minutes).
2. The number of counselors or volunteers Helping Hands can commit for the first month.
3. Any existing intake forms, resource lists, or confidentiality guidelines you’d like us to incorporate.

I’ve uploaded the draft timeline and session outline to the shared Notion workspace and forwarded the latest proposal email thread for easy reference. When you have a moment, could you review those items and let me know if everything looks accurate—or suggest edits where needed?

Thanks so much, and please feel free to propose alternative meeting times if my suggestions don’t fit your schedule. Looking forward to collaborating!

Warm regards,

Jane
