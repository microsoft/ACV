Hello CodeCrafters Team,

I hope all is well. To keep our digital infrastructure upgrade project moving smoothly, could you please review the materials I’ve placed in the following locations and confirm that you have everything you need?

• Gmail – thread titled “TB Group Upgrade – Data Pack”
• Notion – workspace path “TB Group › Upgrade Project › Phase 1 Resources”

After looking over those documents, would you kindly let me know:

1. Whether the data provided is sufficient for your current tasks.
2. Any additional technical specifications, access credentials, or clarifications you may still require.
3. Your preferred schedule for the next milestone review.

If you could reply by [date], that would help us stay on track with our project timeline.

Thank you very much for your collaboration, and please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions.

Best regards,

John
Bank Manager, Trustworthy Banking Group
