Hi Sarah,

Below is a quick snapshot of the most recent customer‐service insights that should help shape the new First Trust campaign. I drew these from our January Monthly Customer Insights Report, the latest demographic breakdown, and call‐center logs for the past quarter.

Top Customer Pain Points (ranked by frequency)
• Minor glitches in the mobile app, especially when transferring funds between accounts.
• Requests for more detailed or filterable transaction history in online & mobile banking.
• Limited weekend branch hours for customers who work standard weekday schedules.
• Occasional wait times on the phone during peak periods (Monday mornings & end-of-month).

Demographic Trends Seen in Recent Inquiries
• Ages 18–25: Heavy adoption of mobile banking (+23% MoM); most questions relate to instant transfers and mobile-deposit limits.
• Ages 30–45: Fastest-growing segment for new accounts; interest in bundled savings + credit-card offers.
• Ages 40–55: Still prefer in-branch service (+15% branch visits); common topics include retirement planning & opening additional savings vehicles.
• Regional skew: Slightly higher inquiry volume in the Southeast (driven by recent branch openings).

Most Common Service-Related Questions / Complaints (Past Quarter)
• “Why did my mobile check deposit hold for longer than expected?”
• “Can I raise my daily transfer limit in the app?”
• “What are the branch lobby hours on weekends/holidays?”
• “How do I set up travel notices for my debit card online?”

NPS / CSAT Themes (Verbatim Highlights)
Positives
• “The mobile app saves me so much time—love the convenience.”
• “Branch staff are always friendly and helpful.”
Opportunities
• “Transfers sometimes fail on the first try—please fix the bug.”
• “Weekend hours would be great for those of us who work 9-to-5.”
Overall NPS held steady at +48 last quarter with a slight dip among heavy mobile-app users.

Seasonal Patterns
• Tax-time spike (mid-Feb through April): higher call volume about direct-deposit timing and IRS refund postings.
• Back-to-school (late Aug/Sept): uptick in student-account openings and debit-card replacement requests.
• Holiday period (Nov–Dec): increased questions about card-fraud alerts & temporary credit-line increases.

Let me know if you need deeper cuts or additional data points—I can pull them quickly. Hope this helps!

Best,
John
