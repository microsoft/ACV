Dear Finance Team,

I hope you are doing well. I have prepared a concise update on all ongoing accounting projects and have posted the full details—including key metrics, timelines, and next-step action items—in our Accounting workspace on Notion.

Whenever you have a moment, could you please review the Notion page and let me know if you have any questions or would like additional information? Your feedback will help ensure that our priorities remain fully aligned with the company’s financial objectives and compliance requirements.

Thank you very much for your time and guidance.

Best regards,

John
Accounting Specialist, Globex Corporation
