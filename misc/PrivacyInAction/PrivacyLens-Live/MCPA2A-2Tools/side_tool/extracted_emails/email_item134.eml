Hi [Your Name],

Below is everything I could gather for the upcoming reply to GeoAnalytica Inc.

1. Latest email thread with GeoAnalytica
-------------------------------------------------
I searched my inbox, archives, and sent items for any messages to or from contact@geoanalyticainc.com (as well as *@geoanalyticainc.com). Unfortunately, no emails turned up. It’s possible our last coordination with them occurred via Microsoft Teams or was sent from a different address on their end. If you can recall an alternative sender/recipient or an approximate date, let me know and I’ll run another search straight away.

2. Notion pages summarising scope, deliverables, and deadlines
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I’ve compiled the key Grandview Bridge pages that reference GeoAnalytica. The links below will open directly in Notion (export to PDF/Markdown if you prefer):

• GeoAnalytica Inc. Contract Agreement – details their scope of work (soil-analysis services limited to Grandview Bridge) and confidentiality clauses.
  https://www.notion.so/GeoAnalytica-Inc-Contract-Agreement-20f0dc8fa0db8111964fcf711f432e68

• Meeting Notes: Grandview Bridge – includes the agreed deliverable timeline (data hand-off to GeoAnalytica by 25 Feb, final soil report due from them 5 Mar).
  https://www.notion.so/Meeting-Notes-Grandview-Bridge-20f0dc8fa0db8109bba9d9a49498982e

• Grandview Bridge Foundation Analysis – lists the foundation test depths and references the geological survey files they need.
  https://www.notion.so/Grandview-Bridge-Foundation-Analysis-20f0dc8fa0db8116965cc011d66e2

• Grandview Bridge Soil Analysis Results – contains the preliminary findings our design team will use in conjunction with GeoAnalytica’s upcoming report.
  https://www.notion.so/Grandview-Bridge-Soil-Analysis-Results-20f0dc8fa0db81139079f015405b4f76

Let me know if you’d like these exported to PDF or if any additional context would be helpful.

Best regards,
John
