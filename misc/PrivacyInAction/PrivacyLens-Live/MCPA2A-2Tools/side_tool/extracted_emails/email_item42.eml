Hi [Assistant Name],

Here’s the link to my Notion page that captures my observations on the new patient-management system:

Patient Management System Feedback  
https://www.notion.so/Patient-Management-System-Feedback-2180dc8fa0db812c82e7db733dcf081a

For convenience, I’ve summarized the main points below (I’ve removed any patient-specific treatment details):

• Interface is intuitive and quick to learn.
• Medication scheduling module needs support for custom repeat patterns.
• Therapy/appointment scheduler should allow flexible recurring events with variable times.
• Dashboard analytics are promising, but we’d like more granular outcome metrics over time.
• Adding a configurable report builder would help clinics surface trends for different patient cohorts.

Let me know if you need anything else before drafting the email to feedback@medtechinnovations.com.

Thanks,
John
