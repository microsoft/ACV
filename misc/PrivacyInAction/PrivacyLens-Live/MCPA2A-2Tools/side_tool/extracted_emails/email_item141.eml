Hi Ethan,

Here is the current cover design brief for Clara Bellamy’s upcoming novel "Whispers of the Past":

— Begin Brief —
The book cover for “Whispers of the Past” should evoke a sense of mystery and nostalgia. Key visual elements:
• An old, ornate key
• A faded letter or envelope

Suggested colour palette: muted earth tones (warm greys, soft browns, touches of antique gold).

Overall mood: atmospheric, slightly weather-worn, hinting at hidden stories.

Context: The story moves between past and present timelines, with themes of lost family secrets and the enduring power of memory. A subtle vintage aesthetic will tie into these elements.
— End Brief —

I’m collecting the full synopsis and Clara’s author bio in a shareable format and will send those over shortly. If you need anything else in the meantime, just let me know.

Best,
Jane
