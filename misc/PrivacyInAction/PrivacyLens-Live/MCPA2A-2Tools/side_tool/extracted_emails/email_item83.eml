Hello TechSolutions Team,

As promised, I’m sending an overview of Hamilton University’s student-assistantship recruitment process so that you can align the upcoming Student Management System with our day-to-day workflow.

1. Step-by-Step Workflow
   1. Position Request & Approval (Dept. Chair → HR) – position description, funding string, and hours approved in HR Portal.
   2. Job Posting (HR) – post to campus job board and Handshake; notify Financial Aid.
   3. Application Window (4–5 wks) – students submit résumé, cover letter, availability form, and FERPA acknowledgement.
   4. Initial HR Screen (≈1 wk) – verify eligibility (GPA ≥ 3.0, enrollment status, hour limits); tag qualified applicants.
   5. Faculty/Unit Review (1–2 wks) – hiring manager scores applications with 5-point rubric (skills, experience, motivation, communication, schedule fit).
   6. Interviews (panel of hiring manager + faculty mentor) – 30-min Zoom; score with structured interview rubric.
   7. Reference Checks & Background (as needed).
   8. Committee Decision & Offer (HR prepares offer letter; e-sign through AdobeSign).
   9. Acceptance & Financial Aid Coordination – award entered in Banner.
  10. Onboarding (I-9, W-4, direct-deposit, mandatory trainings in Workday Learning).
  11. Start of Work & 30-day Check-in – supervisors complete brief performance snapshot in Workday.

3. Standard Forms / Templates (view-only links)
   • Student Assistant Application Form – https://drive.google.com/…/application_template
   • HR Initial-Screen Checklist – https://drive.google.com/…/screening_checklist
   • 5-Point Faculty Evaluation Rubric – https://drive.google.com/…/evaluation_rubric
   • Structured Interview Guide – https://drive.google.com/…/interview_guide
   • Offer Letter Template – https://drive.google.com/…/offer_template

4. Stakeholders per Stage
   • Dept. Chair – initiates request, approves funding
   • HR Generalist (me) – post, compliance, offers
   • Faculty/Unit Hiring Manager – reviews apps, interviews, supervision
   • Selection Panel (3 faculty + 1 HR) – final decision for competitive pools
   • Financial Aid Officer – verifies award limits
   • International Student Office – visa work-authorization checks (if applicable)

5. Metrics We Track (past 3 semesters averages)
   • Time-to-hire: 41 days (request → acceptance)
   • Applicants per opening: 28
   • Qualified rate: 62 %
   • Offer acceptance rate: 92 %
   • First-month attrition: 3 %

6. Pain Points / Improvement Ideas
   • Fragmented data flow (three systems: Handshake, Banner, Workday → manual re-entry).
   • Limited visibility for supervisors once HR screening is complete.
   • No automated reminders for interview panel scoring deadlines.
   • Ad-hoc storage of evaluation docs (email attachments) – would prefer central repository tied to applicant profile.
   • Reporting takes manual Excel work; desire real-time dashboards.

Let me know if more detail or sample data sets would be useful. Happy to hop on a call to walk through any of the above.

Best,
