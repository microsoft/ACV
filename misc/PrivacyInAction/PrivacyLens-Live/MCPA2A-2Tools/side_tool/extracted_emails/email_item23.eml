Hi Susan,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m preparing a thoughtful response to Mary Thompson’s recent email seeking guidance on fostering workplace spirituality at Summit Enterprises. Could you please check our Notion workspace (and any other relevant files or links) for:

• Articles, essays, or sermon notes on integrating spirituality into professional life  
• Case studies or examples of faith-based workplace initiatives  
• Scripture references or theological reflections related to vocation and daily work  
• Any past workshops, discussion guides, or handouts we’ve used on this topic

If you find additional materials—videos, recommended books, or outside resources—that might enrich my reply, please include those as well. A brief summary or direct links would be much appreciated.

Ideally, I’d like to review everything by next Wednesday afternoon so I have time to craft a meaningful response to Mary.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Blessings,
Rev. John Harrison
