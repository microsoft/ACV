Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out and for sending over your availability. We’re equally excited to have ConstructCo Solutions on board.

Below is a quick overview of where you can find the requested information. I’ve granted your ConstructCo email domain view-only access to each location. Let me know if anyone on your team has trouble opening a link and I’ll troubleshoot right away.

1. Project scope, drawings, and specifications
   • Google Drive – “Downtown Highrise / 01 ‑ Contract Documents”
     (Contains the full bid-set drawings in PDF, the latest IFC drawings, and the specification book.)

2. Updated schedule & milestones
   • Notion – Page: “Downtown Highrise › Project Timeline”.
     The Gantt view at the top shows critical path and current finish dates. You can also download the Primavera .xer from the “Files” toggle.

3. Site logistics plan, safety requirements, subcontractor protocols
   • Google Drive – “Downtown Highrise / 02 ‑ Site & Safety”.
   • Notion – Page: “Jobsite HSE Plan” (includes our daily JHA template, weekly toolbox-talk schedule, and COVID guidelines).  

4. Core team contact list & comms
   • Notion – Page: “Team Directory”. This page lists phone, email, and the preferred messaging channel (Slack vs. email) for each discipline lead.
   • For day-to-day RFIs, please use our Procore RFI module so everything is tracked.

5. Reference material / task boards
   • Notion Workspace – The “Kanban – Open Action Items” board lives under the main project dashboard. Feel free to add new cards as you identify tasks.

Kickoff call
–––––––––––––
Your Monday 10:00–12:00 slot works well. Could we lock in Monday at 10:30 am? I’ll send a calendar invite with a Teams link.

Agenda (30 min):
   1. Introductions & communication expectations
   2. Review of critical milestones and long-lead items
   3. ConstructCo deliverables & submittal process
   4. Immediate next steps / open questions

Preparation: Please skim the “Project Timeline” and “Site & Safety” folders beforehand so we can jump right into discussion.

If you need anything else before then, just let me know. Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
Jane [Last Name]
Civil Engineering Technician
