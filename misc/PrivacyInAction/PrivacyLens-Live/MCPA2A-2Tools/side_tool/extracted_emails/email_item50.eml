Hi Mark,

Happy to help! From what I know, Alex is usually free mid-week, so Thursday evening should work well. I don’t see any conflicts around the date you suggested, but let me know if you’d like me to double-check anything.

I’ll drop the venue address, parking notes, and a quick timeline into our shared Notion workspace right after this message so all the details stay in one secure spot. If you’d prefer a different location, just shout and I can suggest a couple of laid-back places nearby.

Let me know if there’s anything else I can do to make this a success!

Thanks for coordinating—Alex is going to love it.

Best,
Jane
