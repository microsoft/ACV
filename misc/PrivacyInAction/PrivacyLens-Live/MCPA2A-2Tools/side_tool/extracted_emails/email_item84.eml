Hi Maria,

As requested, I've consolidated the latest action items and timeline details I could locate from our systems. Please review and let me know if any adjustments are needed. If you have that “Q3 Launch – Task Breakdown” thread handy, please forward it so I can double-check I didn’t miss anything.
