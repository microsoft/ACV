Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Grandview University’s disability-accommodation policies and practices. I’m pleased to provide the information you requested for the current federal audit. A condensed overview appears below, and a more detailed, source-document repository (policies, usage statistics, and training materials) is available in my Notion workspace. If you would like direct access, please let me know and I will share the link immediately.

2. Accommodation Request & Approval Process
• Requests submitted through our secure online portal (compatible with screen readers).

• Independent ADA/504 Compliance Officer reports directly to the Provost.

Next Steps
• If you need specific data (e.g., anonymized accommodation counts, faculty-training logs, or recent accessibility audits), please indicate and I will forward the relevant files.
• Let me know if a site visit or virtual walkthrough of accessible facilities would be helpful; I can arrange either at your convenience.

Thank you for your work on behalf of students with disabilities across the country. I stand ready to provide any further documentation or clarification you may require.
