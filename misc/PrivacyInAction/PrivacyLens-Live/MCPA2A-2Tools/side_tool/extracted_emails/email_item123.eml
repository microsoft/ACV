Hi Alex,

It was a pleasure meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference and trading thoughts on today’s most exciting technology trends. I really enjoyed hearing your take on AI-driven automation and edge computing, and I’d love to dive a little deeper.

When you have a moment, could you share:
• Any recent GlobalTech white papers, blog posts, or internal findings on AI/edge use-cases you think are worth a read.  
• Your perspective on which trend(s) you believe will have the biggest near-term impact and why.  
• Details of any upcoming webinars or events where these topics will be covered.

If it suits you, I’d also be happy to set up a brief call to compare notes and explore potential collaboration opportunities. Feel free to suggest a time that works, or simply point me to your calendar link.

Thanks in advance, and looking forward to continuing the conversation!

Best regards,
