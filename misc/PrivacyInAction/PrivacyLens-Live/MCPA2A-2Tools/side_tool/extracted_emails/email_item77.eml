Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’ve been keeping well and enjoying retirement.

I’m writing to share a quick update on my current involvement with the Heathrow Terminal 5 expansion and to kindly ask for your feedback. Your expertise in airport design has always been invaluable to me, and I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you might have on the direction we’re taking.

I’ve prepared a concise project brief that outlines our latest plans, delivery milestones, and key decision points. If you’re happy to take a look, let me know and I’ll send you a secure read-only link or a PDF summary—whichever you prefer.

In particular, I’d love to hear your perspectives on:
• Operational flow improvements
• Passenger experience considerations
• Any potential design pitfalls we might have overlooked

Please feel free to reply via email—whichever suits you best. Even a brief note would be tremendously helpful.

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance, and I look forward to catching up soon.

Warm regards,

Jane
