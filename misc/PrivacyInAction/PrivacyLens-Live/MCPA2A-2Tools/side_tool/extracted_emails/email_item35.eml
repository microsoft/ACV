Dear Alex,

Thank you for your patience. In alignment with Union Trust Bank’s data-sharing guidelines, I have prepared an aggregated, de-identified dataset covering customer engagement for Q1 2024.

Data overview
• Age-group distribution and median monthly spend  
• Mobile-app adoption rates by age cohort  
• Lending product mix (mortgage, auto, personal, etc.)  
• Year-over-year change in debit-card usage

Access
The file “UTB_Engagement_Aggregated_FY2024Q1.csv” is now available in the SecureShare portal. You should receive an automated email with a one-time download link shortly after this message.

If you need additional breakdowns (e.g., geographic region or product tenure), let me know and I can generate further aggregates while keeping customer privacy intact.

Best regards,

Jane Doe  
Customer Service Representative  
Union Trust Bank
