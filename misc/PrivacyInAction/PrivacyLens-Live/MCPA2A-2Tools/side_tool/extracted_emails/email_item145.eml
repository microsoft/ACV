Hi Mark,

As requested, here’s a concise overview of what we have so far on student engagement for the current and previous term:

1. Participation analytics:
• Average in-class participation has risen by ~15% since mid-term after we introduced weekly discussion prompts and peer-review activities (see Notion page “Class Participation Rates”).

2. Effective strategies observed:
• Opening each session with a thought-provoking question tied to the day’s topic.
• Integrating real-world case studies to ground theoretical material.
• Assigning brief student-led segments to encourage ownership of discussions.

3. Digital tools supporting engagement:
• Poll Everywhere live polls once per lecture to check comprehension.
• Padlet boards for collaborative brainstorming outside class.
• LMS discussion forums with weekly prompts.

4. Pending data:
• End-of-term student survey results for Spring and early feedback forms are being compiled; I’ll circulate the cleaned dataset as soon as it’s available (expected next week).

Let me know if you’d like any additional detail or raw data tables.

Best,
Jane
