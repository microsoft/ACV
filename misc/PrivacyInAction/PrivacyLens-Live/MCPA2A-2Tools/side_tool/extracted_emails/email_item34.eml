Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out. I have gathered the signed authorization form and Michael Thompson’s most recent résumé.

To comply with NexTech Solutions’ data-privacy policy, we transmit sensitive personally identifiable information (such as date of birth and Social Security number) only through an encrypted channel. Could you please provide a secure upload link or other encrypted method so I can transmit Michael’s DOB, last four SSN digits, current address, and our internal application/reference details safely?

In the meantime, I have attached the following documents for your team:
• Signed background-check authorization/consent form (identifiers removed)
• Michael Thompson’s résumé

Once I receive the secure link, I will upload the remaining information and any additional notes from our internal systems right away.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
