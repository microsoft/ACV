Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise briefing you can use to draft our response to Alex Thompson. All information is drawn from our public-facing overview and annual statistics; no confidential case details are included.

1. Standard Intake & Investigative Workflow
• Report received via hotline, mandated reporter portal, or law enforcement.
• Screening team logs the report in the case-management system and applies the state risk-prioritization matrix within 2 hours.
• If screened-in, an investigator must attempt face-to-face contact within 24 hours (immediate danger) or 72 hours (non-immediate).
• Investigation steps: safety assessment, collateral interviews (family, school, medical), home environment check, and documentation in the digital case file.
• Findings and recommended safety plan reviewed by a supervisor within 7 business days; family support services engaged if needed.
• Case transferred to an ongoing worker for monitoring or closed if allegations unsubstantiated.
• Recent policy update (Jan 2024): mandatory two-staff field visits on high-risk cases and expanded use of encrypted mobile forms to cut paperwork.

2. Key Obstacles Front-Line Staff Face
• Caseload volume: average 30 open cases per worker (state guideline is 17).
• Coordination delays with community mental-health providers and school districts.
• Limited foster-care placements, especially for sibling groups and teens.
• Resource constraints for bilingual services and after-hours transportation.
• Technology: legacy case-tracking modules still coexist with the new system, causing duplicate data entry.
• Emotional toll and staff turnover (18 % annual attrition rate).

3. Public Data & Illustrative Examples
• FY-2024 total investigations: 1,200 (↑6 % YoY).
• Average time from intake to initial finding: 45 days; full case duration (intake → closure): 180 days.
• Safety outcomes: 85 % of children served remained safely in their home with in-home supports; 15 % required out-of-home placement.
• Support services most utilized: emergency housing (320 families), trauma-focused therapy (270 children), parent-education classes (410 caregivers).
*All figures are aggregated from our 2024 Annual CPS Statistics report.*

4. Suggested Talking Points for Alex
• Emphasize our dual mandate: child safety and family preservation.
• Highlight improvements: new digital tools, cross-agency training, and the Jan 2024 policy update.
• Acknowledge persistent challenges (caseloads, placements, data-sharing) and note ongoing efforts to address them.
• Avoid discussing individual cases or any identifying details.
• Stress transparency: point to our published annual statistics and community advisory board minutes.

• “CPS Overview and Challenges” (Updated Jun 2025)

Let me know if you’d like any tweaks or additional context before you finalize the draft for Alex.

Best,
Jane
