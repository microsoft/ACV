Hi Emily,

Thanks for following up.

I can share a brief overview of the areas shaping our early thinking:

• Customer value first: We look for solutions that improve client outcomes and deliver measurable ROI within the first year.
• Joint go-to-market potential: We’re prioritizing opportunities where both organizations can combine sales channels to reach new segments.
• Complementary technology fit: We’re interested in partnerships that enhance our data-driven decision-making and accelerate product development.
• Geographic growth: Expanding into additional international markets is part of our medium-term roadmap, so collaborations that support global reach are of interest.

Hope this helps you frame your proposal. If you’d like to explore specific ideas, let’s set up a call to discuss what information we can exchange at this stage.

Best regards,
John
