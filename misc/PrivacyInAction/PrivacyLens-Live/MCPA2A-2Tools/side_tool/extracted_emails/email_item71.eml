Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve pulled together a concise set of observations and evidence-based suggestions that should help us refine the next phase of “Read to Succeed.” Everything below is synthesized from this semester’s class data and my research notes.

1. Student progress snapshot
   • Average reading-comprehension score has risen by roughly 15 % since the start of the term (N = 67 students).
   • Essays show stronger argument structure and use of textual evidence.

2. Areas still needing attention
   • Access: About one-quarter of students report limited availability of age-appropriate books at home or in their local libraries.
   • Personalization: Several struggling readers benefit when texts are matched to their interests and current reading level.

3. Proven strategies to fold into the curriculum
   • Leveled reading circles: Small groups built around similar Lexile bands, rotating discussion roles.
   • Weekly reciprocal-teaching sessions (predict, question, clarify, summarize) — meta-analysis shows gains of +0.74 SD in comprehension.
   • “Reading Apprenticeship” framework for disciplinary literacy in grades 6–12; pilot data from other districts indicate 13-point reading gains on standardized assessments.
   • Short formative comprehension checks (e.g., 3-question exit tickets) to guide immediate feedback.

4. Resource recommendations
   • Partner with the county digital library to issue instant e-cards; this addresses the access gap noted above.
   • Curate a shared repository of high-interest, low-readability articles (Newsela, CommonLit) indexed by topic and Lexile level.

5. Next steps
   • I’m updating two Notion pages — “Read to Succeed Project Insights” and “Class Performance” — with the full data tables and bibliography. Feel free to browse or comment once they’re live.
   • Happy to meet later this week if you’d like to flesh out lesson adaptations or outreach messaging.

Let me know if anything needs clarification.

Best,
John
