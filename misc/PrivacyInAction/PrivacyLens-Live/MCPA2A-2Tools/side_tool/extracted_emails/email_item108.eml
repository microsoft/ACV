Hi NotionManager Team,

Could you please pull the most recent notes and status updates for all current cases jointly managed by Community Health Advocates and Helping Hands United? I’m preparing an email summary for Michael Harris and would like to include:

• Progress since the last update (milestones reached, services delivered, follow-ups completed)
• Any outstanding client needs or action items awaiting Michael’s input
• Upcoming deadlines, appointments, or coordination points over the next two weeks
• Relevant metrics or documents (e.g., assessment results, care plans, referrals) that should be shared

Please let me know if anything needs clarification. A quick turnaround would be greatly appreciated so I can get the message out to Michael promptly.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Jane
