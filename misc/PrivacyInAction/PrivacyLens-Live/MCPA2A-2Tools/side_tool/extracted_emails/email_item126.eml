Hi Charles,

Below is a brief snapshot of my current editorial projects:

1. Helena Blythe – “Whispers of the Past”
   • Key milestones: Full substantive and line edit completed; author has approved the revisions.
   • Blockers/resources: None at present.
   • Next steps & timeline: I will carry out a final proofreading pass later this week and then transfer the file to Production in early July.

At the moment, this is the only active manuscript on my slate; the next two acquisitions are still pending contract finalization, so I have no material updates on them yet. I’ll update you as soon as those move forward.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Best regards,
John
