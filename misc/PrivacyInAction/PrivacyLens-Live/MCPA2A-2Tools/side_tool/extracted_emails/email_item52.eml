Hello NotionManager Team,

I’d like to confirm whether we have a note in the Counseling Center workspace documenting Emily Carter’s excused absence from Professor Smith’s recent test (e.g., date of incident and confirmation that an accommodation is warranted). I do not need any medical or counseling details—just the formal note that verifies she is eligible for academic flexibility.

If such a document exists, could you please point me to its location in Notion or grant me viewing access?

Thank you very much. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Jane Harrison
Psychologist, University of Greenfield Counseling Center
