Hi Sarah,

Thanks for pulling together the response. Here are the references you asked for:

• Gmail: The main thread titled “Quantum Cohesion 2023 Retreat Planning” (dated 21 Feb 2022). That message includes the latest logistics discussion and the preliminary budget outline. I’ll forward that thread to you right after sending this message.

• Notion: The most up-to-date planning board lives in our Team Workspace under Social Committee > Quantum Cohesion 2023. Inside you’ll find a Kanban board (“Retreat Tasks”) and a page called “Budget & Logistics” with our current numbers and vendor contacts.

Key points I’d appreciate highlighting in the reply to the wider team:
1. Budget — we’re currently targeting an overall spend cap of roughly $18 k; final venue quote is still pending.
2. Employee engagement — emphasise that activities are designed to foster cross-team collaboration (e.g., the mini-hackathon concept and an outdoor problem-solving challenge).
3. Timeline — registration survey to all staff will go out by 15 March, and the venue deposit is due 24 March.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need or if you’d like me to take a quick look at your draft before it goes out.

Thanks,
John
