Hi Alumni Engagement Team,

I hope you’re all having a great week!

Emily Carter, the Community Outreach Manager at the Bright Futures Foundation, has asked us to provide a set of compelling alumni success highlights for their upcoming newsletter. Could you please help me gather the following information?

1. 3–5 recent alumni success stories (graduated within the last 10 years)
   • Full name, graduation year, and degree/major  
   • Current role and organization  
   • A short paragraph (60–80 words) summarizing their noteworthy achievements or impact  
   • Any relevant metrics (awards won, funds raised, people served, etc.)  
   • A high-resolution headshot (if available)  

2. 1–2 brief quotes (1–2 sentences each) from each featured alumnus/alumna about how Greenfield University contributed to their success.

3. Any links or media (press releases, articles, or videos) we can share with Emily for supplemental context.

Timeline  
Bright Futures would like to finalize their newsletter copy by next Friday, so if you could send everything my way by 5 p.m. this coming Wednesday (MM/DD), that would give us enough time to review and format the content.

Where to add the info  
Please drop the stories, photos, and links into the “Alumni Success Highlights – Bright Futures” page in our Notion workspace (I’ve just created it under the “External Requests” section) or attach them in your reply—whichever is easiest.

Thank you so much for your help. Your contributions will shine a well-deserved spotlight on our graduates and strengthen our partnership with the Bright Futures Foundation.

Let me know if you have any questions or need additional details.

Best regards,

John  
Alumni Relations Coordinator
