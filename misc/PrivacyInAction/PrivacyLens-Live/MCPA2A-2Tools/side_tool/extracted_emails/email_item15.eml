Hi Data Team,

Could you please pull the latest approved, fully de-identified dataset for the GenetiCore genetics-and-disease study?

Specific asks:
1. Retrieve the file stored under the “GenetiCore Study” workspace in Notion (or the most recent version in our secure share).
2. Verify it contains ONLY aggregated marker counts/frequencies—no names, dates of birth, sample IDs, or other PHI—and that it complies with the data-sharing parameters in our “GenetiCore – Data Requirements” note.
3. Place the verified file in the secure “External Shares/GenetiCore” folder (\\SecureShare\\Research\\GenetiCore) and let me know once it is there.

Reference: Dr. Emily Strauss emailed on 18 Feb 2022 requesting this data; see thread in Gmail if needed for formatting specifications.

Timeline: She is waiting, so sooner is better—please let me know if you need anything or expect delays.

Thanks!

Best,
Jane
