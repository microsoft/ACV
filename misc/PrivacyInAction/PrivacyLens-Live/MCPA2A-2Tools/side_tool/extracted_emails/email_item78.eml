Hi Elizabeth,

I hope you are doing well. Please find below a concise summary of the most recent findings from our remote-learning study. I have removed any personal identifying details about individual students so that the information remains compliant with our data-sharing protocols.

Key highlights (data collected through the end of last week):
• Overall academic performance: average course-wide assessment scores rose by 4–6 % compared with the in-person baseline, with the largest gains observed in mathematics and computer science courses.
• Engagement: synchronous session attendance averaged 83 %, while asynchronous content completion reached 91 %.
• Regional variation: we continue to see slightly lower engagement in rural areas, correlating with limited bandwidth availability. However, the performance gap has narrowed by roughly 2 percentage points since the previous reporting period.
• Student feedback: 78 % of respondents rated the remote-learning experience as “effective” or “very effective,” citing schedule flexibility as the main benefit. Primary concerns remain screen fatigue and occasional platform outages.
• Instructor workload: faculty reported spending approximately 15 % more time on course preparation but only 4 % more on direct student support, largely due to automated grading tools.

A more detailed, fully anonymized dataset (CSV) and the updated slide deck are stored in our shared Google Drive folder under “Remote-Learning Study → Interim Results – June”. If you have any trouble accessing them, let me know and I can resend via a secure link.

Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss any of these points in more detail before our next meeting.

Best regards,
John
