Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for outlining exactly what you need. I’ve just granted you view & comment access to the following Notion pages (let me know if any of the links give you trouble):

1) Annual Outreach Initiative Report – high-level overview of objectives, target communities across Hamilton & Butler Counties, and our calendar of activities.
2) Outreach Program Success Metrics – dashboards with YTD data on individuals engaged, referral-to-treatment conversions, and relapse-prevention follow-ups, plus a few short case stories.
3) FY25 Outreach Budget & Funding Gap – line-item budget, current commitments, and the shortfall we hope Hope & Healing can help close (section at the bottom breaks down exactly how an additional $85,000 would be allocated).
4) Outreach Milestones Tracker – upcoming events and evaluation checkpoints through Q4.

Supplemental materials
• Testimonials & Photos – I placed a folder link at the top of the Success Metrics page that contains three participant testimonials (release forms on file) and photos from last quarter’s mobile clinic days.
• Partner Support Letters – draft letters of support from the county health department and our peer-recovery coalition are stored in the same folder.

If anything else would strengthen the ask, just say the word and I’ll pull it together.

Appreciate you taking the lead on the narrative—looking forward to reviewing your draft.

Best,
John
