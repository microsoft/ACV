Hi Sarah,

I’ve added the finalized schedule, room assignments, day-of contacts, promo files, and logistics notes to the “Community Care Day” page in our shared Notion workspace. Feel free to copy whatever you need.

Quick snapshot for your message:
• Date: mid-March (Saturday)
• Timeframe: volunteer set-up early morning; public activities late morning–mid-afternoon; cleanup follows.
• Location: our parish campus.
• Program highlights: welcome, service stations (food & clothing distribution, health screenings, mini job fair, kids’ zone), closing reflection.
• Volunteer needs: a few parking guides, two health-station helpers, three floaters.
• Promo: flyer (PDF/PNG) + social caption are in the “Promotion” sub-page.

Let me know if you’d like anything adjusted.

Peace,
John
St. Mary’s Parish
