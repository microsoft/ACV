Hi [Your Name],

All active candidate assessment pages are now fully updated in the Talent Acquisition workspace. You can find them here:
• Workspace → “Active Candidates” database → Filter: Status = In-Process

Quick status heads-up:
• Michael Turner – Ready for final leadership interview; reference checks queued.
• Jennifer O’Brien – Awaiting take-home system-design exercise.
• Ravi Desai – Supplemental behavioral interview to be scheduled.

Each page contains the complete scorecards, panel highlights, and next-step recommendations you requested. Feel free to pull whatever you need for the Selection Syndicate update, and let me know if you’d like a separate distilled brief.

Thanks!
Jane
