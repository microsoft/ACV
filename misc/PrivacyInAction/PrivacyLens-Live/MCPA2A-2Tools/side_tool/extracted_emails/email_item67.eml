Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope you are well. As requested, please find below a concise overview of our department’s current compliance status regarding international student regulations.

1. Policies & Procedures
• International Enrollment: We verify admissibility through our International Student Services (ISS) checklist which includes financial documentation, English proficiency, and Form I-20 issuance approvals.
• SEVIS Reporting: We follow a two-step verification—academic advisor sign-off and ISS compliance officer confirmation—before any SEVIS update. Reports are submitted within 10 days of any reportable event.
• Ongoing Support: Mandatory orientation each semester, monthly “Ask-ISS” drop-in hours, and an online knowledge base covering visa maintenance, travel, and employment.
• Documentation: All visa-related forms are stored in the secure ISS Portal, with automated reminders for document expirations 90/30/7 days out.

2. Recent Audits / Internal Checks
• March 2025 Internal Audit – sampled 60 student records; 2 minor discrepancies (outdated address, late OPT card upload) were corrected within 24 hours.
• June 2025 Peer Review – no reportable findings; reviewers recommended expanding orientation content on CPT authorization, which is now incorporated.
• Ongoing quarterly spot checks – latest completed 15 September 2025, zero findings.

3. Compliance Metrics (January–September 2025)
• SEVIS event reporting timeliness: 100% on-time (184/184 events).
• Visa document accuracy: 98% (2 minor data entry errors out of 108 I-20s issued).
• Orientation programs delivered: 3 (spring, summer, fall); average attendance 92% of new international admits.
• Student support contacts resolved within 2 business days: 96%.

4. Challenges & Resource Needs
• Visa renewal delays at certain consulates have increased student anxiety; we are compiling country-specific guidance but would benefit from additional ISS staff hours during peak renewal periods.
• SEVIS technical outages occasionally hamper real-time reporting; access to the upcoming SEVIS batch interface upgrade would mitigate this.
• Capacity constraints for orientation venues—securing a larger auditorium or staggered sessions would improve engagement.

All compliance documentation, audit notes, and metric dashboards are stored in our Notion workspace under the “International Student Compliance” section. If helpful, I can share the pages or provide view-only access.

Please let me know if you need any further detail. I am happy to discuss the above or supply any additional documentation.

Best regards,
