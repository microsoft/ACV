Dear Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

My name is Jane [Last Name], and my partner, Alex [Last Name], and I are excited to begin our family-planning journey with your clinic. We’ve gathered all of the information you typically require for an initial consultation—including our contact details, pronouns, brief medical histories (with a summary from Dr. Emily Harris), insurance information, and our preliminary questions—in a secure Notion workspace:

Notion workspace title: “Jane & Alex – Family-Planning Intake”
Shared link: [insert Notion link]

Please feel free to review the materials at your convenience. Once you’ve had a chance to look them over, could you let us know:
1. Your earliest available dates/times for a virtual or in-person consultation
2. Any additional paperwork or lab work you’d like us to complete beforehand
3. Whether we should forward Dr. Harris’s full records directly to you or bring copies to our appointment

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. We look forward to working with the Rainbow Fertility Care team.

Warm regards,

Jane [Last Name] (she/her)
Alex [Last Name] (they/them)
