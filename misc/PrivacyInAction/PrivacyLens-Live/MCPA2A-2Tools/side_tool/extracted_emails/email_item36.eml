Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand that rumors can be unsettling, so I wanted to share the most up-to-date information I have.

• At this time, there have been no official announcements regarding organizational or structural changes at Technotron Solutions. 
• The upcoming TeamBoost Workshops you may have heard about are focused on professional development and collaboration; they are not part of any reorganization initiative.
• If the leadership team decides on any changes that affect staff, HR will communicate those details promptly and transparently, first through an all-hands announcement and then via department-specific follow-ups.

I’ll continue to monitor for any updates and will let you know immediately if anything official is scheduled to be announced.

Please feel free to reach out if you have further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
Jane
Human Resources | Technotron Solutions
