Hi NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m preparing a reply to Mark Thompson regarding our upcoming financial strategy for Smith Enterprises and would like to include the most current insights. Could you please point me to or grant quick access to the latest materials in the Financial Strategy workspace that cover:

• Current macro-economic outlook for Q3–Q4 2024
• Liquidity and cash-flow optimization tactics for large enterprises
• Tax-efficiency recommendations for high-net-worth corporate clients
• Key takeaways from our recent engagement with CEO John Smith (Smith Enterprises) that are safe to reference externally

If you could tag me or drop the relevant links in Notion by end of day, that would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
