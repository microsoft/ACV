Hi Alex,

Thanks for reaching out – happy to gather everything you need for the launch.

I’ve just added you as a view-only guest to two Notion pages that capture our core brand narrative:

• InnoTech Mission & Values – https://www.notion.so/InnoTech-Mission-and-Values-2180dc8fa0db81f9863fee1252cec701
• InnoTech Company History – https://www.notion.so/InnoTech-Company-History-2180dc8fa0db810087eaee3ea7d24280

These should give you the overarching story, tone, and key principles that guide all of our communications.

I’m still compiling a few additional items you asked for:
– Brand style guide (logo usage, color palette, typography)
– Audience persona deck
– References from our most recent campaign

I expect to have those ready tomorrow and will either forward the files or drop them into the same Notion space.

In the meantime, the high-level messaging pillars for this product launch are:
1. Empowering businesses with innovative, user-friendly software.
2. Delivering customer-centric solutions that drive real results.
3. Demonstrating continuous innovation that sets new industry standards.

Feel free to start mocking up concepts based on this direction, and let me know if you need anything else.

Best regards,
Jane
Administrative Assistant | InnoTech
