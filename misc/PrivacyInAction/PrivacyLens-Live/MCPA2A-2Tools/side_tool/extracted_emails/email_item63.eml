Hello Team,

As requested, please find below a concise overview of our most recent findings from the Notion workspace regarding how passengers perceive and interact with public spaces at airports.

Key takeaways:
• Heightened anxiety around security checkpoints; passengers desire more empathetic and privacy-preserving screening processes.
• Environmental stressors in open concourses—crowding, noise, lack of clear wayfinding—impact perceived safety and comfort.
• Under-monitored zones such as restrooms and quiet corridors are seen as vulnerable areas; passengers express a need for visible security presence and calming design elements in these spaces.
• Personalization and choice (quiet seating zones, adjustable lighting, availability of support staff) correlate with increased sense of control and reduced stress.
• Incorporating biophilic elements (natural light, plants, warm materials) consistently scores well in feedback for fostering calm.

Data sources:
• June 2025 Passenger Experience Feedback survey (n=812).
• Qualitative interviews with 15 passengers conducted May–June 2025.
• Observational studies during peak-hour flow mapping sessions (May 2025).

Let me know if you need the full dataset or additional specifics.
