Hi [Your Name],

I’ve read through the Debug Diary and cross-checked it with the latest performance logs from the current prototype build. Below is a concise technical summary you can fold into your reply to Mark.

1. Rendering & load-time impact
   • The additional modal layer and real-time validation add ~120 ms (avg) to first-interactive on mid-range devices. Overall FCP stays under 800 ms (within our 1-second target) but narrows our buffer.
   • GPU paint cost is minimal; however, CPU time during heavy forms jumps from 42 ms/frame to 58 ms/frame at p95 due to extra listeners. We may want to debounce the on-input events.

2. Accessibility & usability
   • Early a11y tests show the new colour palette meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast, but focus-ring visibility drops on dark mode. Quick fix: add 2-px outline on keyboard focus.
   • Keyboard path through the multi-step wizard is intact, but the “Back” button loses focus context; patch needed for screen-reader announcement.

3. Feasibility & timeline
   • Dev effort: ~3 dev-days for event-handler optimisation + 2 days for a11y polish.
   • QA/UX validation: 1 sprint (5 days) including regression pass on account settings and reporting screens that share the same component library.
   • No backend schema changes required; purely front-end.

4. Risk/open questions
   • Does Marketing expect live field-level analytics from day one? If so, we’ll need to wire amplitude hooks; +1 dev-day.
   • The diary notes two customer tickets involving sync latency during batch writes (unrelated to UI). We should confirm these flows aren’t part of the demo path Mark plans to showcase.

Anything else you’d like me to dig into before you answer Mark? Happy to jump on a quick call tomorrow morning if needed.

Best,
Jane
