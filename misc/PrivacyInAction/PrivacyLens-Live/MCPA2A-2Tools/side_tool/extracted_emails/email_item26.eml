Hi [Your Name],

All set! I just finished refreshing the Wellness Program dashboard in Notion.

Where to look
• Workspace → Wellness Outreach Team → “Zenith Wellness Initiative – Overview” (last edited today at 3:25 p.m.)

What’s new
• Participation metrics – now broken out by activity:
  – Overall enrolment: 78 % of employees (612 of 785), +3 pp vs. last month
  – Fitness-tracker challenge: 160 active users this week
  – Corporate gym membership: 128 active passes
  – Nutrition coaching: 97 active plans
• Key milestones
  – Q1 biometric-screening cycle completed (participation 71 %)
  – Launched 4-week Stress-Less workshop series on 4 Mar (first two sessions full)
  – Passed 1 000 cumulative hours logged in the Move-More step challenge, two weeks ahead of target
• Notable employee feedback (pulled from the Feb pulse survey & direct quotes)
  – 92 % reported they “feel better supported” by the program
  – "The weekly meditation drop-ins have been a game changer for my focus" – Marketing Associate
  – Mark Thompson’s story added to the Success-Stories toggle for leadership talking points

Everything is in collapsible sections so you can copy/paste or export what you need. Let me know if you run into any trouble or need additional detail for Ms. Richardson and I’ll jump right on it.

Thanks!
John
