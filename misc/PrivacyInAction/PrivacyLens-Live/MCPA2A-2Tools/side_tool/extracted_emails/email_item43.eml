Hi NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re well. I’m preparing an introductory email for Lisa (lisa.caregiver@example.com), Ethan’s prospective caregiver, and would like to include accurate, up-to-date insights about Ethan’s:

• Daily routines and schedules
• Dietary preferences and restrictions
• Sensory or behavioral triggers (and successful calming strategies)
• Ongoing therapy goals, progress notes, and upcoming milestones
• Preferred activities, games, or learning tools
• Any other key tips the current care team finds useful

Could you please review the relevant pages in our Notion workspace and provide a concise summary (or an exported PDF/Doc link) of these points by tomorrow afternoon? If there are recent therapist updates or new observations that haven’t yet been logged, kindly flag those as well.

Feel free to drop the summary in our shared “Ethan Care Docs” folder and let me know once it’s ready, or reply here with the details—whichever is easiest.

Many thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
