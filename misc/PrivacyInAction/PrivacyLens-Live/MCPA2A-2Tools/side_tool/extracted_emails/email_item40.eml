Dear Ms. Thompson,

I hope you are doing well.

The Bright Futures Scholarship Foundation has requested additional insight into Michael Smith’s achievements and has indicated that a faculty recommendation will be an important part of their evaluation.

Could you please prepare and send me your recommendation letter for Michael within the next week?

For your convenience, Michael’s updated academic record, awards, and extracurricular details are consolidated in our Notion workspace under:

Notion → Scholarships → 2024 Candidates → Michael Smith → “Achievements & Metrics.”

Feel free to reference any of that material or let me know if you need further information. Once I receive your letter, I’ll submit the full packet to the Foundation at bf_scholarship_foundation@gmail.com.

Thank you very much for supporting Michael.

Warm regards,

John Williams  
Guidance Counselor
