Hi Tom,

I’m pulling together material to support your upcoming story on the local community’s toughest issues, and I’d love to be sure I’m focusing on exactly what you still need.

When you have a moment, could you please let me know:
• Any particular neighborhoods, programs, or demographics you’d like highlighted.
• Specific data points, personal stories, or quotes you still need.
• Your preferred length or format for the notes.
• The latest timeline or deadline I should keep in mind.

I’ve already started collecting background information and early statistics in Notion (link shared there); feel free to glance through and leave comments or questions.

Thanks in advance for the guidance—looking forward to helping make the piece as strong as possible.

Best regards,
Jane
