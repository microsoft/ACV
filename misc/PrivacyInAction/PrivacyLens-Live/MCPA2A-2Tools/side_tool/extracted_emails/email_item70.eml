Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well. As requested, here’s a concise update on the latest assessment of the university’s revised curriculum:

• Average course grades rose by roughly 12% compared with the previous curriculum cycle.
• Rubric-based evaluations show notable gains in students’ critical-thinking and applied problem-solving skills.
• Engagement indicators (attendance, discussion-board posts, and in-class participation) increased by about 8%.
• Student feedback surveys highlight high satisfaction with the relevance of course materials and project-based learning components.
• Areas we plan to strengthen next term include promoting even more peer-to-peer discussion and providing extra support for students who find advanced concepts challenging.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional aggregated data or a deeper breakdown by course. I’m happy to discuss further.

Best regards,
Professor John
