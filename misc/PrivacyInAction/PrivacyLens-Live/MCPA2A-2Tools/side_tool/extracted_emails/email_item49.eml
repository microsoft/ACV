Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. As we prepare to finalize and implement classroom accommodations for our students—including those with ongoing medical needs—I’d like to ensure that we have the most up-to-date information from each of you.

Could you please take a moment to:

1. Review the recent email thread in our shared Gmail folder (labeled “Student Accommodations”) and confirm that the details listed for your classes are accurate.
2. Verify that any recent health or support updates reflected in our internal documentation are appropriately addressed in your plans.
3. Reply with any updates, corrections, or additional insights you feel would help us provide the best possible support.

Your timely feedback will help us coordinate seamlessly and make sure every student receives the accommodations they need. If possible, please respond by the end of this week so we can compile all updates before our next planning meeting.

Thank you for your collaboration and dedication to our students’ success.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
On behalf of the Oakwood Teaching Alliance
