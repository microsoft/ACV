Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently advising a client on a complex litigation matter and would greatly value your strategic perspective.

To give you an overview, I have:
• Uploaded a concise case summary and the key pleadings to our shared Notion workspace.
• Forwarded supporting documents (complaint, recent motions, and scheduling order) to you via Gmail.

Could you please review these materials at your convenience and share any insights on potential defenses, discovery strategy, or settlement posture? Even a brief call or written outline of your thoughts would be immensely helpful.

Please let me know if you prefer a quick meeting—I’m happy to accommodate your schedule.

Thank you in advance for your time and expertise.

Best regards,

Jane [Last Name]
