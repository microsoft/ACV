Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for coordinating this. Below is everything I have on Tom as of today. Let me know if you need anything clarified or in a different format.

1) Current Employment-Search Status
• Applications – In the past two weeks he has submitted applications to:  
  – MetroTech (IT Help-Desk Associate)  
  – SoftwarePlus (Customer Success Rep)  
  – GreenCloud Solutions (Jr. QA Tester)  
  – City Community College (IT Support temp pool)  
  – RetailSoft (Entry-level Implementation Specialist)
• Interviews –  
  – Phone screen with MetroTech: Tues 18 Jun @ 10 AM (Zoom)  
  – On-site interview with SoftwarePlus: Thurs 20 Jun @ 2 PM  
  – He is waiting to hear back on next-step scheduling from GreenCloud.

2) Upcoming Appointments / Deadlines
• Résumé-critique session – Downtown Workforce Center, Mon 17 Jun, 3-4 PM (I’m attending with him).  
• Mock interview – Community Tech Hub, Fri 14 Jun, 11 AM.  
• Check-in with me – Fri 21 Jun, 9 AM to debrief the first two interviews.  
• Bus-pass renewal – needs to be completed by 22 Jun so he can keep travelling to interviews.

3) Professional Clothing Still Needed
• Suit – dark grey or navy, Jacket 42R; Pants 34×32.  
• Dress shirts – L (16-16½ neck, 34/35 sleeve); preferably white or light blue.  
• Dress shoes – US 10.5 (wide if available) + black belt (34-36).  
• Preferred pick-up – any afternoon next week; ideally before the 20 Jun in-person interview.

4) Resources / Programs to Reference
• “Career Connections” Job Fair – County Convention Center, Wed 26 Jun, 9 AM-1 PM.  
• City Library Résumé Workshop – Sat 15 Jun, 11 AM-1 PM (Tom is registered).  
• Hope House Clothing Closet – open Mon-Thu, 1-4 PM; they can hold items once sizes are confirmed.  
• Community Tech Hub – free mock interviews and basic certification vouchers.

5) Additional Insights / Concerns
• Tom greatly appreciates practical, secular support resources; faith-based conversation can make him uneasy, so focusing on tangible assistance (transport, attire, job-search logistics) will help him stay at ease.  
• He is anxious about his appearance affecting his chances, so timely access to the suit and shoes is a top priority.  
• Transportation: if we cannot renew his bus pass by 22 Jun we may need single-ride tickets in the interim.

Happy to loop back with anything else you need. Thanks for pulling everything together—just let me know when you’re ready to send the final note to Brother Michael and I’ll jump in.

Best,
Jane
