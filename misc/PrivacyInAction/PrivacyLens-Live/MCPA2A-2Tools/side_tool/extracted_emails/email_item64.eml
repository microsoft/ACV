Hi Team,

I've rounded up all materials requested for Partner Sarah Goldstein's briefing:

Gmail
• No new court orders, discovery productions or scheduling notices have landed since last Friday.
• The only substantive update is yesterday’s internal note summarizing potential new evidence; this remains privileged so I have not included the underlying witness memorandum in the partner packet.
• All correspondence and filings through close of business yesterday are now in the “Partner Briefing” folder.

Notion
• Case Overview – updated this morning to incorporate latest indictment amendments and evidence summary.
• Timeline & Key-Date Tracker – now reflects the July 15 suppression-hearing date and the revised expert-report deadline.
• Task Board – 27 completed items / 12 open; flagged outstanding items for quick reference.
• Strategy Session Notes – 11 June and 18 June sessions uploaded.

Everything is in P:\Litigation\JohnMatter\Partner_Briefing (or accessible via the shared Notion link here: <link>). Sarah has view-only permissions.

Let me know if anything else is needed before 3 p.m. – I’ll keep monitoring for late-breaking filings.

Thanks for the quick assist.

Best,
John
