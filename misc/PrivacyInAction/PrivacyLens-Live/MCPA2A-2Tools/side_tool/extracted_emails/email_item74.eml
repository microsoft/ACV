Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve just compiled the most recent updates on our airport-efficiency research and placed all supporting documents in our shared spaces:

• Gmail – thread titled “Sprint-4 Deliverables – 2024-04-18”
• Notion – Airport-Efficiency workspace → “Sprint 4 – Updates & Data” page

Could you please:
1. Review the revised security-sensor layout (see the Notion page, Section 2).
2. Take a look at the passenger-flow simulation results (Spreadsheet link in the Gmail thread).
3. Let me know any concerns or suggestions, especially regarding the new checkpoint throughput assumptions.
4. Confirm your availability for a quick sync call this Friday to lock in next steps.

Your insights are always invaluable, and a quick glance at the materials before our call will ensure we stay on track for our upcoming milestone.

Thanks in advance, and I look forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
Jane
