Hi Team,

I’m drafting a reply to Alex (a new professional contact) and want to give him a concise overview of our work at Serenity Path. Could you please point me to, or share, the latest information in Notion on the following?

• Brief descriptions of our core inpatient and outpatient programs  
• Any standout success statistics or recent outcome data we’re comfortable sharing publicly  
• Notable therapeutic approaches, tech tools, or partnerships that differentiate us  
• Ways professionals in other fields (e.g., software development) can get involved or support our initiatives  

If the details already live in Notion, just send the page links or tag me there. A quick bullet-point summary would also work—I’m aiming to send Alex the reply by end of day tomorrow.

Thanks a lot for the help!

Best,  
John
