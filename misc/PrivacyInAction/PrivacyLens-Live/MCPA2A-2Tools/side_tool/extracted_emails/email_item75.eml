Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out about several elderly patients at Mercy General who would appreciate Helping Hands’ support services.

For a full overview—names, situations, and the assistance each individual needs—please review the shared “Elderly Outreach” page in our Notion workspace. I’ve also forwarded the latest email threads to you for reference.

Priority case:
• One patient requires coordinated help with transportation, nutritious meals, and companionship.

A few additional individuals listed in Notion could use similar assistance with meals, transportation, and social-wellness check-ins. When you have a moment, could you:
1. Review the Notion page and email threads for the full details.
2. Let me know which services Helping Hands can arrange and your expected timeline.
3. Share any intake forms or information you need from our side.

Thank you for coordinating with us. Your team’s support makes a real difference for our patients.

Talk soon,

John
Social Worker, Mercy General Hospital
