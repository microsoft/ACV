Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for putting the newsletter together. I’ve reviewed our HR notes and the Newsletter page in Notion, and everything there is up to date. Here are the key items you can safely keep in the final send-out:

• New team members: We have a group of new hires starting next week. Talent Acquisition has their onboarding schedule ready, so you can simply mention a warm welcome in the newsletter.
• Events: A company-wide hackathon and a virtual-reality exploration challenge are on the horizon. Dates are still being finalized, but you can tease them to build excitement.
• Staff changes: No additional promotions, transfers, or departures have occurred since the last draft.
• Org news: No structural or policy changes this month.

If any late-breaking items pop up before tomorrow EOD, I’ll let you know immediately, but as of now you should be good to proceed.

Thanks again for coordinating this!

Best,
Jane
Human Resources
