Dear Tom,

Thank you for getting in touch and for the work you and the HopeBridge Foundation are doing to advance educational opportunities for refugee learners. Over the past several years at Westbrook University we have developed a multi-layered support model for our refugee students. I hope the distilled notes below are useful as you shape or refine your own programs.

1. Create a welcoming foundation
   • Campus orientation designed specifically for refugees (includes tours, introduction to key offices, and a Q&A with current refugee students).
   • Visible statements of inclusion—posters, website banners, faculty syllabi language—reinforce that refugees are valued members of the community.
   • Trauma-informed counseling services and peer-led support circles help address displacement-related stress.

2. Language & academic support
   • Offer an ESL “bridge” program before or alongside credit-bearing coursework; pair it with content tutoring so language growth happens in context.
   • Encourage faculty to build in flexibility (e.g., extended time, glossaries) while students transition.
   • Leverage peer-tutoring platforms—refugee students often prefer practicing English with fellow students in a low-stakes setting.

3. Mentorship & advising
   • Pair each refugee student with both a faculty mentor and a trained peer “buddy.”  We schedule bi-weekly check-ins during the first semester, tapering as students gain confidence.
   • Mentors track academic progress and alert our central support team early if concerns arise.

4. Financial & administrative guidance
   • Micro-scholarships and emergency grants (even modest amounts for textbooks or winter clothing) can dramatically lower attrition.
   • Provide a single point of contact who can help students navigate financial aid, housing contracts, and—when relevant—immigration questions. A checklist in multiple languages prevents paperwork bottlenecks.

5. Community integration
   • Facilitate service-learning or volunteer projects that allow refugees to contribute expertise from their home countries; this reframes them as knowledge‐holders, not just recipients of aid.
   • Host cultural evenings where refugee students share food, music, and stories—these events build campus empathy and networks.

6. External partnerships
   • Collaborate with local resettlement agencies for referral pipelines, case-management insight, and family-centric support.
   • Invite NGOs to co-host workshops on legal rights, healthcare access, and employment pathways.

7. Measuring impact
   • Track retention, GPA, and well-being indicators; brief anonymous surveys twice a semester provide qualitative context.
   • Share findings with stakeholders to secure ongoing funding and to iterate on program design.

Recommended resources
   • UNHCR Education Toolkit (free online)
   • Institute of International Education’s “Refugee Integration in Higher Education” whitepaper
   • NAFSA’s guidelines on trauma-informed advising

Please let me know if any of these points merit deeper discussion or if you would like sample program documents (orientation agendas, mentor training slide decks, survey instruments). I would be happy to set up a call or forward templates.

Again, thank you for your commitment to widening access for refugee students. I look forward to collaborating.

Warm regards,
