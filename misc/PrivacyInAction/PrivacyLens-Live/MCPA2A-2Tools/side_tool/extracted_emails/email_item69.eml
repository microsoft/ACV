Hi Alex,

Thanks for reaching out—happy to help with the next phase of the ERC survey.

I’ve located the visitor logs you mentioned. Because the raw records contain personally identifiable information, our internal policy requires that we either (a) provide the data in an aggregated or de-identified format or (b) have a formal data-sharing agreement in place before releasing any line-item details.

To make sure I prepare the dataset in a form that’s most useful to you while staying compliant, could you please clarify:

• Which specific variables are essential for the survey (e.g., visit date, company affiliation, reason for visit, etc.)?
• Would aggregated counts (for example, monthly totals broken down by visit purpose) satisfy your analysis, or do you need a de-identified row-level file?

Once I have this information, I can coordinate with our compliance team and confirm a delivery timeline—likely within a few business days of receiving your guidance.

Thanks again, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Administrative Assistant
