Hi Mark,

I’ve pulled the latest notes from our Serenity Wellness Center workspace and wanted to share a concise overview of where Thomas and Emily are this week.

––––––––––
THOMAS
• Overall Progress: Thomas continues to show strong engagement. In his most recent individual session he acknowledged the impact of past trauma on his substance-use patterns—a breakthrough that has helped him re-frame triggers. He’s also stepped into a supportive, quasi-leadership role during group therapy, modelling mindfulness and meditation techniques for peers.
• Notable Concerns: He still experiences pockets of self-doubt and heightened anxiety when the discussion turns to mental-health history. We’re reinforcing grounding exercises and have flagged this for deeper CBT work next session.
• Upcoming Appointments:
  – Individual counselling: Tue 18 Jun @ 2:00 PM
  – Group therapy: Fri 21 Jun @ 3:00 PM

––––––––––
EMILY
• Overall Progress: Emily’s attendance remains consistent and she continues to maintain abstinence milestones. She’s actively exploring volunteer opportunities to strengthen her external support network, which should complement her internal recovery work.
• Notable Concerns: Her drive to “give back” is positive, but she tends to over-commit. We’re monitoring for early signs of burnout and reiterating boundary-setting skills.
• Upcoming Appointments:
  – Individual counselling: Wed 19 Jun @ 1:00 PM
  – Vocational coaching/volunteer planning: Mon 24 Jun @ 11:00 AM

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to dig into, or if you have insights that could help us fine-tune their care plans.

Best,
Jane
