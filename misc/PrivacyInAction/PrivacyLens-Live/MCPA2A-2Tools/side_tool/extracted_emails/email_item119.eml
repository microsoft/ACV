Hi Mary,

Thanks for reaching out. Here’s the full packet of information you asked for so you can jump straight into sketching:

1. Authors’ briefs, style preferences & deadlines
------------------------------------------------
Below are the two key threads that capture the authors’ directions so far.

A) Creative Minds Author Agency – "Book Cover Designs for Upcoming Releases" (15 Feb)
   • Core ask: strong thematic imagery that immediately signals genre (spec-fic/fantasy).
   • Must‐keep elements per title:
        – “Whispers of the Ancients” – celestial motifs + ruins; warm gold accent.
        – “The Last Alchemist” – alchemical glyphs; chiaroscuro lighting; muted jewel palette.
        – “A Dance of Shadows” – silhouettes around fire; high-contrast orange/black.
   • Timeline confirmation requested: approval of final covers by 31 Mar so files can go to press.

I’ve pasted the full email below my sign-off for easy reference.

B) Literary Horizons Colour Team – "Finalized Color Schemes for Your Titles" (18 Feb)
   • Attached palette document (I’ve included the hex & CMYK values in the appendix of this mail).
   • Usage guidance: headline colour = title treatment; secondary colour = spine background; accent colour = back-cover spot.

2. Excerpts from “The Editor’s Companion” design notes
-----------------------------------------------------
From my Notion notebook:
• Use symbolic elements central to each story.
• Employ contrasting colour palettes to stand out on shelf.
• Title-specific notes (same as above – ruins/cosmos, glyphs, silhouettes around fire).

3. Print specs & series branding guidelines
------------------------------------------
• Trim size (all three): 6 × 9 in (152 × 229 mm).
• Spine widths (based on current page counts + 55 # natural stock):
      – Whispers …  0.81 in / 20.6 mm (350 pp)
      – Last Alchemist 0.94 in / 23.9 mm (405 pp)
      – Dance of Shadows 0.76 in / 19.3 mm (330 pp)
• Bleed: 0.125 in all sides.
• Series branding: small Literary Horizons quill logo top-centre of spine; back-cover imprint block bottom-left (spec PDF attached).

4. Launch date & milestone calendar
-----------------------------------
• 11 Mar – your first-round sketches
• 18 Mar – internal review w/ authors
• 25 Mar – revised comps from you
• 31 Mar – author sign-off / colour lock
• 08 Apr – final print-ready PDFs (so the printer can hit the 15 May on-sale date)

If anything here is unclear or if you need further detail—especially around finish options (matte laminate vs soft-touch, spot UV, etc.)—just let me know and I’ll pull the specs.

Looking forward to seeing your first concepts!

Best,
John
