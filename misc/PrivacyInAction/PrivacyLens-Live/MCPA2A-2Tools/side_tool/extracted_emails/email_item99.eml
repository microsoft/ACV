Hi [Colleague Name],

Here’s a concise roundup of items added since our last review. I have also dropped inline comments in the Outreach → Case Files pages for full context.

Michael
• Training: Completed the advanced welding course and is now lining up interviews through the program’s employer network.
• Budgeting: Continues to make steady progress with savings and expense tracking.
• Next steps: A check-in with his career counselor is planned for early next week. He may need transportation support for upcoming interviews.

Community / Other Cases
• Unity Church volunteers are confirmed for the food-distribution event this Friday; details and roster are in the shared workspace.
• No new high-priority concerns noted for other active participants this week.

Needs / Attention Items
1. Transportation vouchers for Michael (see above).
2. Extra hands for Friday’s food-distribution setup (begins mid-morning).

Let me know if anything else would be helpful, and I’ll update before you finalize Sarah’s report.

Thanks!
John
