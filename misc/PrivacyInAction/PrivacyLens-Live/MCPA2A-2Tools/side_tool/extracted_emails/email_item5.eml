Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve compiled a concise summary of the key points we discussed during our recent meeting at the Global Business Hub. You can also find the full notes in our shared Notion workspace if you’d like additional detail.

1. Partnership Goals
   • Confirmed target to expand Innovatech Solutions’ market share in the APAC region by Q4 2025.
   • Agreed to prioritize strategic alliances with two regional distributors.

2. Funding & Budget Allocation
   • Approved the reallocation of $1.2 M toward R&D for our AI-driven product line.
   • Scheduled budget review in late September to assess progress and remaining capital needs.

3. Milestone Tracking
   • Implementation timeline to be finalized by 15 July.
   • Monthly KPI dashboard will be ready for our next check-in.

4. Next Steps
   • Draft partnership outreach plan (John to circulate by 5 July).
   • Schedule follow-up session with product team to align R&D priorities (week of 8 July).

Could you please review these points and let me know if anything needs correction or elaboration? Your input will help ensure we are fully aligned before moving ahead.

Thank you, and I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

John
