Hi [Name],

I’ve reviewed the Alumni Tracker and pulled the most recent highlights and action items for the Class of 2005 and 2010 cohorts:

Professional & Personal Milestones
• John Smith (’05) was promoted to Director of Marketing at Innotech Solutions.
• Emily Johnson (’05) published her second novel, which has been shortlisted for a national literary award.
• Mark Lee (’10) founded a new tech start-up that has secured significant venture-capital funding.
• Lisa Ray (’10) expanded her non-profit’s education programs to three additional countries.

Event Reminders
• Oakwood Charity Gala – 15 June (several alumni will be recognized for their philanthropic work).
• Oakwood Alumni Scholarship application deadline – 30 April.

RSVP / Contact Changes
• No new RSVP updates have been logged since our last review.
• Updated email or phone info is now available for five classmates across the two classes. For privacy, I’ve added these details to the secure committee Google Sheet instead of listing them here.

Still Seeking Updated Contact Info
• The “missing contact” list remains at 12 alumni. Outreach is continuing, and I’ll flag any breakthroughs as they come in.

If there’s anything else you’d like spotlighted for the committee’s next email, just let me know.

Best,
Jane
