Hi Sarah,

I’ve checked our Gmail threads and the shared Notion workspace for the most recent information on HEAP and the Vax4All vaccination drive. Here’s a concise snapshot:

HEAP (Health Empowerment & Awareness Program)
• Last recorded update in Notion: late June 2025.
• Current focus areas: community workshops, pamphlet distribution, and development of interactive online resources.
• No newer milestones or decisions have been documented in our channels since then.

Vax4All Vaccination Drive
• Last recorded update in Notion: late June 2025.
• Scope: setting up temporary vaccination sites in the target community area, coordinating with local providers, and conducting outreach/education campaigns.
• No additional milestones, timelines, or approvals are captured in Gmail or Notion after that entry.

Next Steps
• I’ll reach out to the individual task leads this week to collect any updates that may not yet be documented.
• If you have offline notes from recent meetings, please share them so I can add them to our shared resources before the status report is finalized.

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to dig into.

Thanks!
John
