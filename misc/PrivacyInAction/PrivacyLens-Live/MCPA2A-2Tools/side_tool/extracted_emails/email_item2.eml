Hi Emily,

As promised, here’s a concise package of evidence-based resources you can draw on when working with anxious clients. I’ve bundled the material so you can scan quickly and pull what you need for sessions or treatment planning.

1. Core Protocol Outlines
   • CBT for Anxiety – step-by-step framework, sample agenda, and suggested homework assignments.
     Link: https://www.notion.so/Cognitive-Behavioral-Techniques-for-Anxiety-2180dc8fa0db813fa5b6c83f025e3e87
   • Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) – values clarification worksheet, defusion exercises, and session map.
   • Exposure Therapy – hierarchy-building template and in-vivo / imaginal exposure tips.

2. Client-Friendly Handouts & Worksheets
   • Diaphragmatic Breathing one-pager (instructions + practice log)
   • 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique cheat-sheet
   • Worry Log template (automatic thought record adapted for GAD)

3. Recent Findings & Case Highlights
   • Brief summary of a panic-disorder case illustrating the combination of cognitive restructuring with grounding skills (identifiers removed).
   • Key take-aways from 2024 meta-analysis on CBT vs. ACT efficacy for anxiety (spoiler: both effective; ACT shows slightly better maintenance at 6-month follow-up).

4. Tips for Intern-Level Implementation
   • Start with a narrowly defined target (one primary symptom cluster) to avoid overwhelm.
   • Use the “explain, model, practice, review” loop in every session.
   • Build in weekly skill check-ins—short (3-5 minute) “skills spotlights” keep clients engaged.
   • Keep exposure steps micro-sized at first; celebrate partial successes to reinforce adherence.

If you’d like more depth on any piece (e.g., full session scripts or additional worksheets), just let me know and I’ll pull those for you.

Hope this helps!

Best,
John
