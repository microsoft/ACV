Hi Team,

I’m preparing a reply to Sarah López at our partner charity, Compassion in Action, and I need the latest donor-engagement metrics to finalize the message.

Could you please pull together the following information and send it to me no later than 3:00 p.m. tomorrow (Tuesday, [date])?

• Year-to-date donor retention rate
• Average gift size — year-to-date and for Q2 specifically
• Number of new donors acquired in Q2
• Email open and click-through rates for our last three campaigns
• Any notable engagement trends or insights worth highlighting (e.g., successful segments, channel performance, seasonal spikes)

For background, you can reference the “Donor Engagement – 2024” page in Notion and the Gmail thread titled “CIA Collaboration Data.”

Thanks in advance for the quick turnaround. Let me know if you need any clarification.

Best,
John
Fundraiser | Bright Futures Foundation
