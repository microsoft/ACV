Hi Sarah,

Here’s a quick status update on the investment-strategy presentation:

• Slide deck structure: Complete (cover, agenda, section headers).
• Strategy overview section: Drafted and formatted. Awaiting your sign-off.
• Market analysis slides: Waiting for the refreshed data from the market-trends report you’re updating.
• Risk & mitigation section: Outline done; numbers from Finance Ops expected by Thursday.
• Design polish: Graphics and charts 60% done; I’ll finish the remaining visual tweaks after we drop in the final data.

Timeline check-in: If we can lock the market analysis content by EOD Thursday, we should have the final version ready for internal review Monday morning and rehearsal Tuesday.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
John
