Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out. Please find below a high-level overview of Union Trust Bank’s dispute-resolution framework. These points are approved for external publication; let me know if you need anything clarified.

1. Workflow (customer-initiated complaint to closure)
   • Intake & acknowledgement – Customers can lodge a dispute through our secure online portal, by phone, or at any branch. A unique case reference is generated and we acknowledge receipt (usually within 24 hours).
   • Preliminary review – A specialist confirms that the claim meets regulatory criteria (e.g., the disputed transaction falls under Regulation E or Regulation Z) and gathers initial documentation.
   • Investigation – We request information from the merchant/acquirer and may ask the customer for supporting evidence. Where regulations require, a provisional credit is issued while the investigation continues.
   • Decision & notification – Findings are documented, the customer is advised of the outcome and any permanent credit or reversal is applied.
   • Case closure – Records are retained in line with applicable retention rules.

2. Typical timeframes
   • Acknowledgement: within 24 hours of receipt
   • Provisional credit (when applicable): normally within the regulatory 10-business-day window for debit transactions, or by the next statement cycle for credit card transactions.
   • Final decision: the majority of disputes are concluded within 30 calendar days; complex cross-border or ATM claims can extend up to 45–90 days as permitted by regulation.

3. Escalation options
   • Internal: customers who disagree with the decision can request a second-level review.
   • External: customers may take the matter to the Banking & Investments Ombudsman Service or their state Department of Banking & Finance; contact information is provided in our final decision correspondence.

4. Recent improvements
   • Launch of an enhanced online portal that allows customers to track the status of their dispute in real time and upload supporting documents.
   • Additional training and staffing in the disputes unit to accelerate turnaround times and promote consistent outcomes.
   • Updated customer-communication templates to make decisions clearer and outline next steps.

5. Aggregate performance (publicly reportable)
   • Union Trust Bank’s target is to resolve at least 90 % of disputes within 30 days. Year-over-year reporting indicates we are currently meeting this goal.

I hope this provides the context you need. If you have follow-up questions, feel free to let me know.

Best regards,
