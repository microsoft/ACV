Hi Tom,

I’m putting together an overview for you on our community’s current situation along with Path to Sobriety’s most recent activities. Could you please take a moment to review the notes and metrics I’ve gathered in our shared Notion workspace (pages: “Community Status” and “PTS – Recent Initiatives”)?

Once you’ve had a chance to look them over, let me know if anything needs clarification or if you’d like additional details included in the final update.

Thanks for your time, and I appreciate your quick feedback.

Best regards,
Jane
