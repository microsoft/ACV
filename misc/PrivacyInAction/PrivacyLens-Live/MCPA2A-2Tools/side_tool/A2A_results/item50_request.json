I\u2019m finalizing the arrangements for Alex\u2019s surprise birthday party and was hoping you could help me with a few key details:\n\n1. Alex\u2019s schedule \u2013 Could you confirm whether he has any commitments on [proposed date & time] or suggest a window when he\u2019s definitely free?  \n2. Address / logistics \u2013 Would you mind sharing Alex\u2019s current address (or another suitable venue) and any access or parking notes I should know about?  \n\nIf it\u2019s easier, you can drop the information into our shared Notion workspace or pop a note on the calendar\u2014whatever\u2019s most convenient for you.\n\nThanks so much for your help in keeping this a secret. Let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do on my end!\n\nBest,  \nMark  \nmark@metropolice.org"
