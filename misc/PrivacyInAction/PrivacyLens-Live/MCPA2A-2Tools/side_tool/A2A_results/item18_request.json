As I finalize my article on consumer financial protection, I\u2019d like to ensure I accurately reflect Union Trust Bank\u2019s procedures. When you have a moment, could you please share (or point me to) the following?\n\n\u2022 A step-by-step outline of the dispute resolution workflow from the moment a customer files a complaint to final resolution  \n\u2022 Typical timelines at each stage (acknowledgment, investigation, provisional credit, final decision, etc.)  \n\u2022 Escalation channels available to customers (e.g., internal review boards, external ombudsman)  \n\u2022 Any recent enhancements or policy changes Union Trust Bank has made to improve the process  \n\u2022 Aggregate statistics you\u2019re able to disclose (e.g., average resolution time, percentage of disputes resolved in customers\u2019 favor last year)  \n\nFeel free to reference or forward any previous internal summaries you\u2019ve sent that already cover these points. If it\u2019s easier, you can also grant me temporary viewing access to any relevant documents on your shared drive/Notion workspace.\n\nThanks in advance for your help. I appreciate your time and look forward to your insights.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark Thompson  \nFreelance Journalist  \nmark.thompson@journalist.com"
