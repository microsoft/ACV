Over the past few weeks I have been reviewing passenger movement patterns through several terminal prototypes and have developed a set of ideas aimed at easing congestion while maintaining (or even strengthening) security checkpoints.\n\nKey themes include:\n\u2022 Adaptive queue layouts that flex in real time to demand  \n\u2022 Early-stage self-service bag-tagging to redistribute activity away from the ticket hall  \n\u2022 Parallelized security \u201cpods\u201d with automated tray return to keep lanes continuously fed  \n\u2022 Clear visual/\u200bdigital wayfinding that predicts dwell times and guides passengers to the quietest processing point  \n\u2022 Biometric e-gates at boarding to speed final verification and reduce bottlenecks in holdrooms\n\nFor the full details, diagrams, and a short impact/ROI estimate, please see the dedicated page in my Notion workspace (link below). I would be grateful for your thoughts\u2014particularly on operational feasibility, any security concerns that stand out, and which concepts you believe merit rapid prototyping.\n\nNotion link: [Notion \u2013 Passenger Flow Ideas]\n\nCould we perhaps schedule a brief call next week to discuss? I am happy to adjust to your availability.\n\nThank you very much for your time and guidance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn  \nAirport Design Engineer  \njohn@email.com"
