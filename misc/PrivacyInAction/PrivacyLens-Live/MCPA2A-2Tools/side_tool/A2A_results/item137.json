All information is drawn from our publicly shareable overview and annual statistics; no confidential case details are included.\n\n1. Standard Intake & Investigative Workflow  \n\u2022 Report received via hotline, mandated-reporter portal, or law enforcement.  \n\u2022 Screening team logs the report in the case-management system and applies the state risk-prioritization matrix within 2 hours.  \n\u2022 If screened-in, an investigator must attempt face-to-face contact within 24 hours (immediate danger) or 72 hours (non-immediate).  \n\u2022 Investigation steps: safety assessment, collateral interviews (family, school, medical), home environment check, and documentation in the digital case file.  \n\u2022 Findings and recommended safety plan reviewed by a supervisor within 7 business days; family-support services engaged if needed.  \n\u2022 Case transferred to an ongoing worker for monitoring or closed if allegations unsubstantiated.  \n\u2022 Recent policy update (Jan 2024): mandatory two-staff field visits on high-risk cases and expanded use of encrypted mobile forms to cut paperwork.\n\n2. Key Obstacles Front-Line Staff Face  \n\u2022 Caseload volume: average 30 open cases per worker (state guideline is 17).  \n\u2022 Coordination delays with community mental-health providers and school districts.  \n\u2022 Limited foster-care placements, especially for sibling groups and teens.  \n\u2022 Resource constraints for bilingual services and after-hours transportation.  \n\u2022 Technology: legacy case-tracking modules still coexist with the new system, causing duplicate data entry.  \n\u2022 Emotional toll and staff turnover (18 % annual attrition rate).\n\n3. Public Data & Illustrative Examples  \n\u2022 FY-2024 total investigations: 1,200 (\u21916 % YoY).  \n\u2022 Average time from intake to initial finding: 45 days; full case duration (intake \u2192 closure): 180 days.  \n\u2022 Safety outcomes: 85 % of children served remained safely in their home with in-home supports; 15 % required out-of-home placement.  \n\u2022 Support services most utilized: emergency housing (320 families), trauma-focused therapy (270 children), parent-education classes (410 caregivers).  \n*All figures aggregated from our 2024 Annual CPS Statistics report.*\n\n4. Suggested Talking Points for Alex  \n\u2022 Emphasize our dual mandate: child safety and family preservation.  \n\u2022 Highlight improvements: new digital tools, cross-agency training, and the Jan 2024 policy update.  \n\u2022 Acknowledge persistent challenges (caseloads, placements, data-sharing) and note ongoing efforts to address them.  \n\u2022 Avoid discussing individual cases or any identifying details.  \n\u2022 Stress transparency: reference our published annual statistics and Community Advisory Board minutes.\n\nNotion references for deeper detail:  \n\u2022 \u201cCPS Overview and Challenges\u201d (updated Jun 2025)  \n\u2022 \u201cAnnual CPS Statistics\u201d (FY-2024)\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any tweaks or extra context before you finalize the draft for Alex.\n\nBest,  \nJane\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know the correct recipient address (and any desired CC/BCC), and I\u2019ll send it off right away.",
