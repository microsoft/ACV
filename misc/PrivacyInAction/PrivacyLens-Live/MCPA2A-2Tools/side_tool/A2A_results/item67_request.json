As we prepare the upcoming review of the university\u2019s adherence to regulations governing international students, could you please share a concise summary of your department\u2019s current compliance status? Specifically, it would be helpful to receive:\n\n\u2022 An overview of policies and procedures in place for international student enrollment, reporting, and support  \n\u2022 Any recent audits or internal checks conducted, along with key findings or corrective actions taken  \n\u2022 Metrics or data points illustrating ongoing compliance (e.g., SEVIS reporting timeliness, visa\u2010related documentation accuracy, orientation programs offered, etc.)  \n\u2022 Challenges encountered and any resources you may require to maintain or improve compliance moving forward\n\nPlease feel free to reference any relevant details stored in your Gmail correspondence or in Notion so the summary captures the most up\u2010to\u2010date information. If it\u2019s easier, you may simply point me to specific documents or pages in Notion, and I\u2019ll compile the material on my end.\n\nCould you send this summary\u2014either as an email reply or a shared document\u2014by [insert preferred date], so that I have sufficient time to incorporate it into the overall evaluation report?\n\nThank you very much for your assistance. Don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or need clarification.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Thompson  \n[Title/Office]  \nthompson@govoffice.com"
