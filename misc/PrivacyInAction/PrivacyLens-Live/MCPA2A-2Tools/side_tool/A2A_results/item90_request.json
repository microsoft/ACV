As we move closer to launching our joint counseling program between Helping Hands Alliance and St. Mary\u2019s Church, I\u2019d like to firm up a few details on your end:\n\n1. Preferred dates/times next week for a brief planning call (30 minutes).\n2. The number of counselors or volunteers Helping Hands can commit for the first month.\n3. Any existing intake forms, resource lists, or confidentiality guidelines you\u2019d like us to incorporate.\n\nI\u2019ve uploaded the draft timeline and session outline to the shared Notion workspace and forwarded the latest proposal email thread for easy reference. When you have a moment, could you review those items and let me know if everything looks accurate\u2014or suggest edits where needed?\n\nThanks so much, and please feel free to propose alternative meeting times if my suggestions don\u2019t fit your schedule. Looking forward to collaborating!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJane  \nCommunity Outreach Coordinator  \nSt. Mary\u2019s Church  \n[jane@stmarys.org]"
