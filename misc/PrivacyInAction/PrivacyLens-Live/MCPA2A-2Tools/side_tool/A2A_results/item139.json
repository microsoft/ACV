These points draw primarily from The Advocate\u2019s Ledger briefs as well as our in-house research notes.\\n\\n\u2022 Visa quota expansion for skilled workers\\n  \u2013 What changed: Congress approved a 15% increase in annual numbers across the EB-2 and EB-3 categories.\\n  \u2013 Effective date: Applies to petitions filed on or after July 15, 2025.\\n  \u2013 Practical impact: Skilled applicants who were previously stuck in multi-year backlogs should see shorter waits. Encourage eligible community members with advanced degrees or specialized experience to consult about possible filings.\\n\\n\u2022 New Temporary Protection Status (TPS-P) for nationals of designated \u201cpolitical-turmoil countries\u201d\\n  \u2013 What changed: DHS created a streamlined, two-year protection that allows work authorization and deferred removal.\\n  \u2013 Effective date: Initial application window opens August 1, 2025.\\n  \u2013 Practical impact: Community members from qualifying countries can apply without showing individualized persecution. They will need to meet basic continuous-presence and criminal-history requirements.\\n\\n\u2022 Filing-fee waivers\u2014expanded eligibility\\n  \u2013 What changed: USCIS broadened the poverty-line threshold from 150% to 200% for most humanitarian-based applications.\\n  \u2013 Effective date: Rule takes effect September 10, 2025.\\n  \u2013 Practical impact: More low-income applicants (especially asylum-seekers and VAWA self-petitioners) will be able to submit without cost; important to flag during clinics.\\n\\n\u2022 DACA litigation update\\n  \u2013 The Fifth Circuit kept the current injunction in place but preserved renewals while the Supreme Court considers cert. No new applications are being accepted.\\n\\n\u2022 Border processing policy\\n  \u2013 CBP extended the CBP One mobile app scheduling pilot until December 2025; daily appointment slots increased from 1,000 to 1,250.\\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to elaborate on any of these points or supply citations from The Advocate\u2019s Ledger briefs.
