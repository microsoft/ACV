Co-Investment Opportunities \u2013 We are assembling a pipeline of growth-stage companies in FinTech, sustainable infrastructure, and applied AI where your sector expertise and network could provide differentiated value. A co-investment framework would allow us to combine due-diligence resources and enhance deal capacity.\\n\\n2. Strategic Advisory \u2013 Sterling & Locke is finalizing the structure of our upcoming Fund IV. Your experience in crafting value-creation strategies for portfolio companies could add significant depth to our advisory board and sharpen our go-to-market positioning.\\n\\n3. Thought Leadership & Research \u2013 We are expanding our market intelligence program and would welcome collaboration on joint white papers or investor roundtables.
