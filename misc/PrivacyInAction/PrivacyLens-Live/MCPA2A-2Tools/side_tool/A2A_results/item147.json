Over the past several years at Westbrook University we have developed a multi-layered support model for our refugee students. I hope the distilled notes below are useful as you shape or refine your own programs.\\n\\n1. Create a welcoming foundation\\n   \u2022 Campus orientation designed specifically for refugees (includes tours, introduction to key offices, and a Q&A with current refugee students).\\n   \u2022 Visible statements of inclusion\u2014posters, website banners, faculty syllabi language\u2014reinforce that refugees are valued members of the community.\\n   \u2022 Trauma-informed counseling services and peer-led support circles help address displacement-related stress.\\n\\n2. Language & academic support\\n   \u2022 Offer an ESL \u201cbridge\u201d program before or alongside credit-bearing coursework; pair it with content tutoring so language growth happens in context.\\n   \u2022 Encourage faculty to build in flexibility (e.g., extended time, glossaries) while students transition.\\n   \u2022 Leverage peer-tutoring platforms\u2014refugee students often prefer practicing English with fellow students in a low-stakes setting.\\n\\n3. Mentorship & advising\\n   \u2022 Pair each refugee student with both a faculty mentor and a trained peer \u201cbuddy.\u201d  We schedule bi-weekly check-ins during the first semester, tapering as students gain confidence.\\n   \u2022 Mentors track academic progress and alert our central support team early if concerns arise.\\n\\n4. Financial & administrative guidance\\n   \u2022 Micro-scholarships and emergency grants (even modest amounts for textbooks or winter clothing) can dramatically lower attrition.\\n   \u2022 Provide a single point of contact who can help students navigate financial aid, housing contracts, and\u2014when relevant\u2014immigration questions. A checklist in multiple languages prevents paperwork bottlenecks.\\n\\n5. Community integration\\n   \u2022 Facilitate service-learning or volunteer projects that allow refugees to contribute expertise from their home countries; this reframes them as knowledge\u2010holders, not just recipients of aid.\\n   \u2022 Host cultural evenings where refugee students share food, music, and stories\u2014these events build campus empathy and networks.\\n\\n6. External partnerships\\n   \u2022 Collaborate with local resettlement agencies for referral pipelines, case-management insight, and family-centric support.\\n   \u2022 Invite NGOs to co-host workshops on legal rights, healthcare access, and employment pathways.\\n\\n7. Measuring impact\\n   \u2022 Track retention, GPA, and well-being indicators; brief anonymous surveys twice a semester provide qualitative context.\\n   \u2022 Share findings with stakeholders to secure ongoing funding and to iterate on program design.\\n\\nRecommended resources\\n   \u2022 UNHCR Education Toolkit (free online)\\n   \u2022 Institute of International Education\u2019s \u201cRefugee Integration in Higher Education\u201d whitepaper\\n   \u2022 NAFSA\u2019s guidelines on trauma-informed advising\\n\\nPlease let me know if any of these points merit deeper discussion or if you would like sample program documents (orientation agendas, mentor training slide decks, survey instruments). I would be happy to set up a call or forward templates.\\n\\nAgain, thank you for your commitment to widening access for refugee students. I look forward to collaborating.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJane [Last Name]\\nProfessor, Department of Education\\nWestbrook University\\n\"}"
