The vibe is upbeat and united\u2014exactly what we want heading into the final stretch.\\n\\nLooking Ahead\\nNext week we\u2019ll shift to opponent-specific walk-throughs while tapering physical load to ensure freshness on game day. The group is confident but grounded; they know nothing is won yet and are channeling that focus into each session.\\n\\nLet me know if you need any additional details or quotes.
