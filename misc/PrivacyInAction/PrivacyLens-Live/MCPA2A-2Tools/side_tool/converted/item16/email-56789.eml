Dear Executive Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

As we step into the new year, I wanted to share the finalized version of the Annual Financial Report for 2021, along with an outline of the budget planning for 2022. Please find the attached documents for your review and feedback.

Key highlights from this year's financial performance include:
- A 12% growth in revenue compared to the previous fiscal year.
- A 9% reduction in operational costs through improved efficiency measures.
- Successful completion of our major investments in infrastructure and technology, which are expected to contribute to sustained growth in the coming years.

In terms of budget planning for 2022, we aim to focus on:
1. Expanding our market presence by increasing our allocation towards marketing and sales.
2. Enhancing employee training programs to foster innovation and upskill our workforce.
3. Allocating resources towards research and development for new product lines.

I would appreciate it if you could review the attached documents and come prepared with your insights and suggestions for our upcoming budget review meeting scheduled for Monday, January 10, 2022, at 10:00 AM. A calendar invite will follow shortly.

Thank you for your dedication and hard work throughout the past year. I look forward to discussing your ideas and priorities as we work together to make 2022 a successful year for OptiTech Solutions.

Best regards,
