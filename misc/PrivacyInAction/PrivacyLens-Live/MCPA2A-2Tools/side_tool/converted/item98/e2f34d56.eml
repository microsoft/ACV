Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out regarding post-operative care resources. I appreciate your dedication to helping individuals in need and ensuring they have access to the right tools for their recovery.

In response to your request, I’ve gathered a few resources that I believe will be beneficial:

1. **Post-Op Recovery Guides**: There are comprehensive PDFs available through resources like Johns Hopkins and the Mayo Clinic that provide step-by-step guidelines for recovery after different types of surgeries. These include daily care checklists and dietary recommendations.

2. **Local Support Groups**: Many communities have volunteer organizations that offer practical assistance, such as meal preparation and transportation for follow-up appointments. I would recommend checking in with local chapters of groups like the Red Cross or similar foundations.

3. **Affordable Equipment Sources**: For those needing medical equipment like walkers or shower chairs, organizations like Goodwill and The Salvation Army often have low-cost options. Additionally, many hospitals lend such equipment out to recovering patients.

If you’d like, I can look further into additional resources specifically tailored to the demographic you’re working with. Let me know if there are any particular areas or needs you’d like me to prioritize!

Looking forward to hearing how I can help further.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
