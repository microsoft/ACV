Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding a sensitive matter concerning parishioner support that we recently discussed. As you know, there have been some challenges within our community, and I believe it's important we address these with care and discretion.

Could we arrange a time to meet or have a call so we can go over the details further? Your insight and guidance would be invaluable in helping us determine the best path forward.

Please let me know your availability in the coming days, and I will do my best to accommodate. Additionally, if there is any preliminary information or resources you think might be relevant to this issue, please don’t hesitate to share them ahead of time.

Thank you so much for your time and assistance in this matter.

Warm regards,  
Tom Clarkson
