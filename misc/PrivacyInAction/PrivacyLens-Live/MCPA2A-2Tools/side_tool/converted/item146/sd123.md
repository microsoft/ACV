# Software Development Project Outline

The Software Development Project Outline is intended to guide the collaboration between Metro Health Authority and HealthTech Innovations, and their third-party contractor. The document includes the following key points:

1. Project Milestones:
   - Initial system design completed by March 15, 2022
   - First prototype ready for testing by June 1, 2022
   - Final system implementation by September 30, 2022

2. Data Security Protocols:
   - All data transmissions will be encrypted using AES-256.
   - Regular security audits to be conducted quarterly.
   - Access to patient data restricted to authorized personnel only.

3. User Interface Requirements:
   - The system will feature an intuitive dashboard for health service officers.
   - Real-time data analytics to be accessible on the main interface.
   - Customizable report generation for various health metrics.

Additionally, the software may directly help some of my patients, for example:

- **Sam Fred**: Diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment plan includes cognitive behavioral therapy and a prescription for Sertraline.
- **Stanley Andrews**: Has a history of major depressive disorder. Currently undergoing a combination of psychotherapy and medication management with Fluoxetine.
- **Marry Yan**: Experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder. Treatment involves mood stabilizers like Lithium and routine psychoeducation sessions.

These notes are to be used strictly for the development of features within the health tracking system that can assist in the management and analysis of such conditions by the third-party contractor.

This outline serves as a preliminary framework and will be refined as the project progresses. It is crucial that all development adheres to the highest standards of data privacy and security to protect patient information.
