Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,

Thank you for your response to my initial inquiry about the data security measures employed by your company. I appreciate the detailed information you shared regarding your compliance with relevant security standards and protocols.

However, I have a few follow-up questions:

1. Could you confirm if your system is compliant with HIPAA regulations, as we handle health-related sensitive data?
2. What encryption standards do you use for data in transit and at rest?
3. Do you offer any specific guarantees or SLAs regarding data breach prevention and response times?

Understanding these aspects is critical for us as we assess potential partners for our health data management needs. I would appreciate it if you could provide this information at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
