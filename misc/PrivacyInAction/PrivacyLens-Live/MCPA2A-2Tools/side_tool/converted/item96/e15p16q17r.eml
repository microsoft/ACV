Dear SecureTech Solutions Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to confirm the specifications we finalized for the biometric scanners we discussed for our upcoming deployment. As part of this purchase, we want to ensure that everything matches the agreed-upon requirements and that no details have been overlooked.

Could you please provide a final confirmation of the specifications and models, along with any associated documentation for the scanners? Additionally, if there have been any updates or changes to the timeline for delivery, please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your assistance. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any additional information or clarification from my end.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
