# Ethan's Daily Routines

Ethan thrives on a structured schedule. He wakes up at 7 AM, has breakfast (prefers oatmeal with bananas), and then engages in morning exercises. He has a particular affinity for puzzles and enjoys his puzzle-solving time from 10 AM to 11 AM. Lunch is at 12:30 PM, where he prefers simple sandwiches. Post-lunch is usually time for reading or music until his therapy session at 3 PM. He has dinner at 6 PM, followed by his favorite TV show about nature. Bedtime is strictly at 8:30 PM.
