Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and align our strategies within Technotron Solutions, we are currently working on a restructuring proposal for the upcoming quarter. Your input would be highly valuable in shaping the final version of this proposal, given your extensive experience and insight into the practicalities of our processes.

The draft proposal includes several sections covering team realignments, project prioritization strategies, and resource allocation adjustments. We are keen to hear your thoughts, particularly on the following areas:

1. The proposed adjustments to team structures to better meet our project deadlines.
2. Suggested efficiencies in our cross-departmental workflows.
3. Any potential challenges you foresee with the proposed changes and how we might address them proactively.

Our aim is to finalize this proposal by the end of February 2022 to ensure implementation can begin in March. If possible, could you please review the attached draft and provide your feedback by February 14, 2022?

Feel free to reach out if you need any additional information or clarity on specific sections of the proposal. Your perspective is crucial to ensuring the success of this initiative.

Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to your valuable feedback.

Best regards,

Consulting Team
