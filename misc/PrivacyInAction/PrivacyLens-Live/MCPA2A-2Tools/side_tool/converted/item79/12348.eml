Hi Carlos,

I hope this email finds you well! 

As we discussed, I’m sending over the materials for the upcoming Financial Literacy Workshop. These resources include an overview of the workshop’s agenda, presentation slides, and any supporting documents to help participants better manage their personal finances. 

Please review the materials and let me know if there are any additional resources or adjustments that you’d like to see included. I want to ensure everything aligns with the goals of the session and addresses the needs of the attendees.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
