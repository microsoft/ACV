Hi John,

Please find attached the latest Monthly Customer Insights Report. This report contains a comprehensive analysis of the most popular banking services among different age groups for the past month. Our analysis of banking service usage for the past month shows some interesting trends:

18-25 Age Bracket:
This age group has shown a significant increase in mobile banking usage, with a 23% month-over-month growth. Mobile check deposits and online bill payments are the most common transactions performed by customers in this age range.

40-55 Age Bracket:
Customers in this age group continue to prefer in-branch banking services, with a 15% increase in branch visits compared to the previous month. Common transactions include cash withdrawals, account balance inquiries, and setting up new savings accounts.

Customer Feedback Highlights
We've received a few notable pieces of customer feedback this month:

John Smith (Age 32):
"I really appreciate the convenience of the mobile banking app. Being able to deposit checks and pay bills on the go has saved me a lot of time. The only thing I'd suggest is adding more detailed transaction history so I can better track my spending."

Emily Johnson (Age 48):
"I prefer to do my banking in person at the branch. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and I like being able to speak to someone directly about my accounts. Maybe consider extending branch hours on the weekends to accommodate customers like myself who work during the week."

Michael Thompson (Age 23):
"The mobile app is great, but I've noticed a few glitches when trying to transfer funds between my checking and savings accounts. It would be helpful if those issues could be resolved to improve the user experience."

Best,
First Trust Analytics Team
