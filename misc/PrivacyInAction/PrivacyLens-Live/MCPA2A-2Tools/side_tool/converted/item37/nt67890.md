# Quantum Innovations Culture Feedback

Feedback from the team indicates a strong appreciation for the collaborative environment at Quantum Innovations. However, there is a desire for more opportunities to engage in creative problem-solving and to have a platform for sharing innovative ideas. The retreat could include a 'hackathon' style event to address this feedback, allowing team members to work on projects outside of their usual scope and present their solutions to the group.
