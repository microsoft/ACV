# Fertility Consultation Schedule

Consultation dates available: March 15-20, April 5-10. Prefer weekdays. 

Dr. Emily Harris mentioned the importance of a personalized approach due to our unique situation. 

Questions to ask: 
- What are the success rates for IUI and IVF for lesbian couples? 
- What legal considerations do we need to be aware of? 
- Are there any recommended dietary or lifestyle changes prior to treatment?
