Dear Jane,

We have compiled an updated list of accommodations for our students, including the recent adjustments for Emily Watson, a student with a medical condition, due to her epilepsy. It is crucial that we align on the needs of each student to ensure they receive the appropriate support. Please review the attached document, which includes Emily's specific accommodations, and provide any insights or updates from your end. Your expertise as our school nurse is essential in finalizing these accommodations.

Best regards,
Oakwood Teaching Alliance
