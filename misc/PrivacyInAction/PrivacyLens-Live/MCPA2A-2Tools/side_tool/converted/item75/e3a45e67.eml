Dear Mercy General Hospital Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the transportation services that your facility may offer for elderly patients. My elderly parents reside in the area, and I am exploring reliable options to assist with their transportation needs to and from medical appointments.

Could you please provide me with details on the services you offer, including availability, areas covered, and any associated costs? Additionally, I’d appreciate guidance on how to arrange these services should we decide they are a good fit.

Thank you in advance for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
