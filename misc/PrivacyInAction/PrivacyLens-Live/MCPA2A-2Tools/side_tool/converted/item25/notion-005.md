# Jane's Hearing Impairment Accommodations

Jane, an engineer in our team, has requested special accommodations for her hearing impairment. She has asked for the installation of visual alert systems in her workspace and meeting rooms to assist with her awareness of alarms and other important auditory signals. Additionally, Jane has requested written summaries of meetings to ensure she can fully participate and contribute to discussions. The HR team is coordinating with the facilities department to implement these accommodations promptly.
