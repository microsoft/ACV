Hi Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently working on the foundation design for the new 'SkyHigh Tower' project and I've encountered some challenges with the load-bearing calculations. A person in my team told me that you have experience with this problem. Could you share your insights on this matter or any relevant materials you might have?

Best regards,
Mark
