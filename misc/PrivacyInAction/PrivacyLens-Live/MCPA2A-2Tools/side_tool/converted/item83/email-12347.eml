Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update regarding the decisions made by the hiring committee and to outline the next steps for moving forward. 

The committee has concluded its review process, and we are ready to proceed with the next phase. We may need your input and expertise to finalize some technical details related to the candidate onboarding system, ensuring a seamless integration with our existing tools. Your previous support in handling similar technical transitions has proven invaluable, and we are confident in your ability to assist us efficiently this time as well.

Please let me know a convenient time to discuss the specific requirements and timelines in detail. Also, if there are any updates or new solutions you’d recommend implementing as part of this process, feel free to bring those forward during our discussion.

Looking forward to your response and continued collaboration.

Best regards,
