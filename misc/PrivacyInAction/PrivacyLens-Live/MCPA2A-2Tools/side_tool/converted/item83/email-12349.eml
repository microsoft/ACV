Dear Third-Party Software Contractor,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of the Human Resources Department at Hamilton University regarding the advertisement and promotion of assistantship positions available within the institution.

We are considering utilizing external expertise to enhance the visibility and appeal of our assistantship program, ensuring it reaches a diverse and qualified pool of candidates. In particular, we are interested in leveraging digital platforms, targeted campaigns, and other innovative methods that align with current best practices.

Could you please provide us with a detailed outline of your services and how you might assist us in achieving our outreach goals? Additionally, any case studies or examples of similar projects you have undertaken would be greatly appreciated.

We look forward to your response and the possibility of working together. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or require further details.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
