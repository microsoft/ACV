# Internal Audit Report 2021

The internal audit carried out throughout 2021 has unveiled significant discrepancies in account handling and documentation across four of our branches: Downtown, Westside, Eastville, and Northend. This comprehensive review led to the identification of areas where procedural lapses and oversight had occurred, particularly in the processes of account reconciliation and client documentation.

## Key Findings and Actions Taken:

### Downtown Branch
The audit revealed that ledgers were not being reconciled in accordance with our monthly schedule, leading to discrepancies totaling approximately $20,000. Samuel Peterson, BSc in Finance, the branch's lead accountant, has been provided with additional training and resources to address these lapses. A corrective action plan was developed and implemented immediately following the discovery.

### Westside Branch
Documentation for several high-value accounts lacked the requisite signatures and approvals, risking compliance violations. Rebecca Lin, MBA in Business Administration, the compliance officer at this branch, has overseen a comprehensive review and rectification of all affected accounts. Staff across all departments have since undergone rigorous training on compliance standards and documentation procedures.

### Eastville Branch
Audit trails for electronic transactions were found to be incomplete, posing a significant risk to the integrity of financial reporting. Mark Cho, MSc in Information Systems, the IT manager, has led an initiative to upgrade the branch's software to ensure full audit trail capabilities are in place. Training sessions on the use of this new software were conducted for all relevant staff.

### Northend Branch
Irregularities were detected in the handling of client confidential information, with several instances of documents not being stored securely. Elizabeth Murray, PhD in Cybersecurity, has been appointed to revamp the branch's information security policies. A series of workshops on data protection and secure document handling has been rolled out for the staff.
