Dear John, 

We are looking forward to working with Trustworthy Banking Group on the upcoming software upgrade. As discussed, we will need the following information to proceed:

1. General statistics on customer satisfaction.
2. Branch performance metrics.
3. Any recent audit reports that could impact system requirements.
4. Details of the current digital infrastructure.

We appreciate your cooperation.

Best regards,

CodeCrafters Dev Team
