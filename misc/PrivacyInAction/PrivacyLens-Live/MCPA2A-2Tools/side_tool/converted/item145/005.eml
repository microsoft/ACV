Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just sending a friendly reminder about the student papers review process. As agreed earlier, the submission deadline is approaching, and we aim to complete the evaluation by the end of this month.

Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need any additional resources or assistance during the review. Feel free to reach out if there are any delays or concerns that might affect the timeline.

Thank you once again for your invaluable contributions to this process. Your expertise is greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
