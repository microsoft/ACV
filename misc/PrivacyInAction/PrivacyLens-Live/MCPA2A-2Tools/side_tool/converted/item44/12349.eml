Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Harmony Alliance Collaboration. I appreciate your interest in exploring potential synergies between our organizations.

As per our earlier discussions, I believe there are several areas where we can align and create mutual value. For instance, leveraging CityTimes' extensive outreach capabilities to amplify the initiatives under the Harmony Alliance would be an exceptional direction to take. It would be great to hear your thoughts on this.

Can we schedule a follow-up meeting to delve deeper into the specifics? I am available this week on Thursday or Friday afternoon. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
