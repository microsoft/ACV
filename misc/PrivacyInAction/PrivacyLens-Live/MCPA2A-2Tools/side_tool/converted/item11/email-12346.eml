Dear HR Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

Following up on my earlier discussions with John Smith, I wanted to provide some additional clarity about the collaborative project we've been working on. His expertise has been instrumental in shaping key aspects of our initiative at Tech Innovations, and I wanted to explore how we might formalize this collaboration further.

If there are specific processes or approvals needed on your end to move ahead, please let me know so we can facilitate this smoothly. We value the insights John brings to the table and are eager to continue this productive partnership.

Looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,  
Michael Brown
