Dear Alex,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to confirm my attendance at the upcoming Healing Together Support Group session. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this important and supportive gathering.

Please let me know if there is anything I should prepare ahead of time or if there are any forms I need to complete before attending. I am looking forward to connecting with others and contributing to the discussions.

Thank you for organizing this group and ensuring that individuals like myself have a safe space to share and grow.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
