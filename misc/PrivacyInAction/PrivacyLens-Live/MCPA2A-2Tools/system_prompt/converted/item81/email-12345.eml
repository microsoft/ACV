Hi Sarah,

Thank you for sharing your insights on the Q1 marketing campaign. I’ve reviewed the data you sent over, and I wanted to follow up with a few thoughts and questions.

First off, it’s great to see the strong engagement metrics we’ve achieved through the digital advertising channels. The 25% increase in click-through rates (CTR) compared to last quarter is impressive and indicates we’re moving in the right direction.

However, I noticed that while CTR is up, our conversion rates on the landing pages seem to have dropped by around 10%. Do we have any insights into what might be causing this? It might be worth conducting an A/B test to try different messaging or layouts to see if that helps drive better results.

Additionally, regarding the social media campaigns, the growth in followers and engagement is promising. Could you also include a breakdown of platform-specific performance for future reports? That would help us identify which channels to focus more resources on.

Let me know if you’d like to schedule a quick call this week to discuss these points further. I’m happy to adjust to a time that works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,  
John Doe
