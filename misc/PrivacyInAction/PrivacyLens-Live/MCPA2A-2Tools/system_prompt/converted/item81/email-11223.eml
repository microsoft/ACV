Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well.

As per our recent discussion, I’m sharing some preliminary insights regarding the ongoing marketing campaign. Here’s a quick overview:

1. Campaign reach: The campaign has reached approximately 150,000 targeted users in the last month.
2. Conversion rates: We are seeing a promising conversion rate of 3.2% overall, with some regions performing even better.
3. Engagement metrics: Email open rates are currently averaging 24%, while click-through rates stand at 6%.

This data reflects the performance until February 6, 2022. I believe there’s potential for further improvement by tweaking the ad placements and possibly resetting the timing of our email blasts. I’d love to hear your thoughts or recommendations on this.

Could we schedule a call later this week to go over these metrics in detail? Let me know what time works best for you.

Best regards,
