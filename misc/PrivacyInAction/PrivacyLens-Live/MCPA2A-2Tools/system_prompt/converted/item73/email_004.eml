Dear Jane,

We appreciate the time you took to review our preliminary design for the new dispatch software. Your insights are crucial to ensuring the software meets the needs of emergency medical technicians like yourself. We noticed you had some thoughts on the feature set, particularly regarding the quick access to medical equipment and the streamlined patient information interface. Could you provide us with more details on these aspects or any other features you believe should be included?

Warm regards,
TechMed Solutions Design Team
