Hi Jim,

Following up on our conversation, I've given some more thought to the features we discussed for the new dispatch software. I believe a key addition would be a streamlined interface for quick access to medical equipment databases. This would allow EMTs to verify the availability of necessary equipment en route to a call. Additionally, integrating a feature that allows for quick updates on protocol changes would be highly beneficial, ensuring that all team members are informed in real time.

Best regards,
