Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to share the confidential details regarding Mr. Thompson's recent medical diagnosis and his proposed care plan. 

After careful evaluation and consultations, Mr. Thompson has been diagnosed with early-stage Type 2 Diabetes. While this is a significant finding, his condition is manageable with the right care and lifestyle adjustments. Below are the key components of his care plan:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**: A strict diet focusing on low glycemic index foods, reduced carbohydrates, and increased fiber intake has been recommended.
2. **Regular Exercise**: A commitment to moderate-intensity exercise for at least 30 minutes, 5 times a week.
3. **Medication**: He has been prescribed Metformin, which he should take as directed by his primary care physician.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular blood sugar level checks, along with quarterly follow-ups, are critical.
5. **Support System**: Ensuring he has emotional and peer support to help him stay motivated throughout this journey.

As someone at Helping Hands who is closely involved in patient advocacy and support, your role in assisting Mr. Thompson to adjust to his new care routine will be invaluable. Please coordinate with his primary care team to ensure a seamless implementation of the plan. Additionally, please keep all communication regarding this matter strictly confidential to protect his privacy.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the care plan, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,  
John Doe
