Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well. As the holiday season approaches, I wanted to reach out to discuss our schedule and ensure we’re aligned on any tasks or events that need coordination. With the festivities often bringing about changes to standard routines, it feels like a good idea to confirm availability and discuss any adjustments required.

If you have some time this week, let me know your availability so we can align calendars. It’s important that we address any potential overlaps or gaps before the holiday break begins.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,  
Jane
