Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding community support initiatives. As discussed, it would be great to collaborate on a project that highlights local efforts and resources available for residents in need.

Specifically, I was wondering if City Times might be interested in showcasing stories about organizations that provide assistance with food access, housing, and mental health. I know many readers would appreciate learning about these resources and how to get involved in volunteering or donating.

Please let me know your thoughts on this and whether there’s an opportunity to move forward. I’m happy to provide any additional information or contacts for feature articles.

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best regards,
