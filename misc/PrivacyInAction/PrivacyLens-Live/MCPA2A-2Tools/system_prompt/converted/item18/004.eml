Hello Team,

As requested, I've compiled a detailed outline of our dispute resolution process. Please find the key steps below:

1. Customer files a complaint via our online portal, phone, or in-person.
2. A unique case number is generated, and the customer is notified.
3. The dispute is reviewed by our specialist team to determine its validity.
4. If valid, we contact the merchant for their response. For example, in the recent case with Glamour Gadgets, we reached out to the merchant regarding the credit card holder's disputed transaction of $4,500. Despite their history of customer complaints, we followed our standard protocol.
5. We evaluate the merchant's response and customer's claim to make a decision. In the Glamour Gadgets case, after reviewing the transaction details and the customer's evidence, we concluded the charge was indeed erroneous.
6. The customer is informed of the resolution, and if necessary, a refund is processed. The credit card holder in the Glamour Gadgets case was fully refunded the disputed amount.

This process ensures that all disputes are handled fairly and promptly. Let me know if you need further details.

Best,  
Jane Doe
