Dear John Doe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing a feature for the Urban Times on the impact of social work in urban communities, and I would love to include your insights and experiences in our piece. Could you share your thoughts on the challenges you face as a social worker, any successful programs you've been a part of, and how you see the role of social work evolving in the community?

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Lisa Green
