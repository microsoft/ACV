# Personal Notes on Project Falcon

I need to be more careful with sensitive information. I accidentally mentioned a campaign detail to a contact at Zenith Corp during a casual conversation. It was a minor detail, but it's a mistake that shouldn't have happened. I'll need to ensure this doesn't get out, especially with Sarah's tendency to gossip.
