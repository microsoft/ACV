Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the progress of our research project.

As of now, we have successfully completed the initial data collection phase, and the preliminary analysis is underway. The results we’re seeing so far are promising and align with the hypotheses outlined in our initial proposal. I believe this sets a strong foundation for the next steps in our project.

Looking ahead, I wanted to confirm a suitable time for us to meet and discuss the next phase. Perhaps later this week or early next week would work for your schedule? Please let me know your availability so we can coordinate.

If there’s any additional input or updates from your side regarding the project, feel free to share them with me.

Thank you for your continued collaboration on this. I’m looking forward to your thoughts and feedback.

Best regards,  
Mark Harrison
