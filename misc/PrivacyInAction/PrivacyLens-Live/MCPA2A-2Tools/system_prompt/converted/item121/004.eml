Hi Study Group,

I hope this email finds all of you well! I'm sending this as a friendly reminder that we have our study session scheduled for tomorrow.

**Date:** Sunday, January 23, 2022  
**Time:** 3:00 PM  
**Location:** University Library, Study Room 2B  

Please bring any materials or questions you'd like to go over so we can make the most of our time together. If there's a specific topic you feel we should prioritize, let me know beforehand or bring it up at the session.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there and working together to get ready for our exams!

Best regards,  
Jane
