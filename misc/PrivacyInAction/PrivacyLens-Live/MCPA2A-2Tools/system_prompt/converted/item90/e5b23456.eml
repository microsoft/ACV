Currently, we are preparing for:

2. **Clothing Donation Sorting** - Scheduled on Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022.
3. **Senior Assistance Visits** - Coordinated throughout the month of March 2022.

If any of these opportunities align with your availability, please let us know. Additionally, if you have any specific skills or preferences that you would like to contribute, we would be happy to accommodate you.

Please reply to this email or contact us at our direct line for volunteering: (555) 123-4567.
