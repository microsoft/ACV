Hello Jane,

Thank you for your continued support. The outline for the joint initiative looks promising. I believe that with St. Mary's Church's involvement, we can make a significant impact on our community's well-being. Please let me know if there's any specific information or documentation you need from us to proceed.

Best regards,
Mark
