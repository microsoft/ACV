Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to provide an update on the Grandview Bridge project. As of today, February 16, 2022, I’m pleased to report that the project is progressing on schedule and within budget.

Recent achievements include the completion of the foundation work and the successful installation of the first section of the bridge deck. Over the next few weeks, our team will focus on finalizing the support piers while continuing to monitor all aspects of construction for adherence to safety and quality standards.

We anticipate completing the next major phase of the project by the end of March 2022, which will involve the placement of the final deck segments. Weather permitting, we are confident we can maintain this timeline.

If you have any specific questions or require additional details, feel free to reach out. I will ensure to keep you updated as we reach subsequent milestones in the project.

Thank you for your support and interest in the Grandview Bridge project.

Best regards,
