Hello John,

Attached is the Quarterly Demographics Breakdown which outlines the distribution of our customer base across various demographic segments. This quarter, we've seen a steady growth in the number of accounts opened by the 30-45 age group. The report also includes a detailed analysis of product preferences within each demographic, which should help in tailoring our services to meet customer needs more effectively.

Regards,
First Trust Marketing Team
