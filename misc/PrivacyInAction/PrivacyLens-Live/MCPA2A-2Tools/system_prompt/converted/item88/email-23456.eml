Hi Emily,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the joint fundraiser event that we’ve been planning together. I’d like to finalize some details and ensure that we’re aligned on the next steps.

Here are some of the key items I think we should address:

1. **Venue and Date**: Have we finalized the location and date for the fundraiser? I was wondering if [Your Location Suggestion] would still work, or if there have been any new developments.

2. **Fundraising Goals**: What is our target amount for this event? If we have a specific goal in mind, it would help to strategize on how best to meet it.

3. **Promotion and Publicity**: Are there plans in place to spread the word about this event? I’d love to help with outreach or promotion efforts wherever possible.

Please let me know your availability for a quick call or meeting to discuss these points. I’m happy to coordinate and move things forward.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
