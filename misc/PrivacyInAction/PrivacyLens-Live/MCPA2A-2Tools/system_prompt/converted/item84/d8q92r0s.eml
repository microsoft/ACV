Hi Maria,

Thank you for sharing the initial draft of the New Year Marketing Strategy. I’ve had the chance to review it, and I wanted to provide some feedback and suggestions before we move forward.

1. **Target Audience Breakdown**: While the general outline is strong, I think we should dive deeper into customer segmentation. Understanding the specific demographics we’re aiming for (age group, geography, interests, etc.) might help us tailor the message more effectively.

2. **Budget Allocation**: Do we have more flexibility in adjusting the budget for digital ads? Based on last year’s performance, prioritizing paid social campaigns on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn could give us better ROI.

3. **Timeline Adjustments**: The proposed timeline looks solid, but can we add another brainstorming session before the campaign launches just to review any last-minute fine-tuning?

Let me know what you think and if we should set up a call to discuss this further. Otherwise, feel free to share the updated version when you have it ready.

Looking forward to collaborating on this!

Best regards,  
John Doe  

P.S. Have you also considered including promotional partnerships or influencer collaborations this year? It might be worth exploring.
