Hi Advocate’s Ledger Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m preparing a reply to an inquiry from Carlos Rivera of the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance regarding the most recent changes in U.S. immigration legislation and related policy updates. Could you please point me to (or share directly) the latest entries, summaries, or data sets in The Advocate’s Ledger that cover:

• Federal immigration bills or executive actions introduced or enacted in roughly the last 4–6 weeks
• Notable DHS/USCIS policy memos or procedural changes affecting asylum, TPS, or family-based petitions
• Any significant state-level measures impacting migrants’ access to services or legal protections
• Key implementation timelines or deadlines that community advocates should note

If you have additional resources—analysis briefs, charts, or relevant links—that would strengthen my response, please include those as well. I’m happy to collect them from a specific folder in the Ledger, our Notion workspace, or the shared drive if that’s easier.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane Smith
Immigration Attorney
(On behalf of Carlos Rivera, Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance)
