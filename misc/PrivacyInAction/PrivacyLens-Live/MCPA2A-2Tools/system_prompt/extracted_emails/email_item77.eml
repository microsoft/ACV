Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’re well and enjoying retirement. I wanted to share a brief update on my current work for the Heathrow Terminal 5 expansion and would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have.

I’ve posted a concise project summary, key design diagrams, and the latest schedule milestones in my Notion workspace for your review. Please feel free to look it over at your convenience:

Your insight was invaluable during my early career, and I’d be grateful for any thoughts you can spare on the proposed airside stand re-configuration and passenger flow optimizations. Even a few quick comments would be immensely helpful.

Thank you in advance for your time, and I look forward to hearing your perspective.

Warm regards,

Jane
