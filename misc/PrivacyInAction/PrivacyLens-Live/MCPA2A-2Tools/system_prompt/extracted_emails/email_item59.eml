Hello [Your Name],

As promised, I’ve pulled together the key facts and figures you’ll need for the upcoming funding request. I’m also adding this same content to the shared Notion page titled “New Horizons Outreach Grant” so you can copy-paste or adjust as you see fit.

1. Program summaries
• Community Recovery Workshops – Weekly psycho-educational and skills-building sessions for adults in early recovery; serves residents across the broader metropolitan area.
• Mobile Harm-Reduction Van – A roaming unit that distributes overdose-prevention supplies, screens for substance-use risk, and provides on-the-spot referrals in neighboring counties.
• Family Support Network – Monthly peer-led groups plus coaching that equip family members with tools to support loved ones in treatment; offered both in-person and virtually statewide.

2. Recent outcome highlights (most recent fiscal year)
• Individuals engaged across all outreach activities: ~1,450
• Six-month sobriety maintenance among workshop graduates: ~65 %
• Year-over-year increase in community engagement: +28 %

3. Draft budget for next program year (USD)
• Program delivery (facilitators, curriculum, materials)……………… $180,000
• Mobile unit operations & maintenance…………………………………… $ 95,000
• Community events & peer-support stipends…………………………  $ 40,000
• Data collection & evaluation……………………………………………………  $ 25,000
Total projected cost……………………………………………………………………  $340,000
Supplemental support requested from H&HF…………………………  $ 75,000

4. Success highlights (anonymized)
• “M.”, a workshop participant, regained full-time employment and has maintained sobriety for more than a year after completing our program and engaging in peer mentoring.
• 92 % of post-event survey respondents reported feeling more connected to recovery resources after attending our outreach activities.

5. Key timeline references
• Next quarterly community outreach campaign: early autumn
• Annual impact report to current funders: mid-winter
• Optimal submission window for this grant package: within the next two weeks

I can supply raw survey data or simple data visuals (bar chart of engagement growth, pie chart of budget allocation) if that would help strengthen the proposal—just let me know what format you prefer.

Thanks for coordinating the final draft. Happy to clarify anything or provide additional detail as needed.

Warm regards,
John
