Hi [Name],

As requested, please find the full email thread with MedTech Solutions below. I've also tagged you on the following Notion pages that capture our feedback, privacy considerations, and current workflow for handling patient data:

• Patient Profile Management – General Statistics
• Personal Workspace → Patient Profile Management section (meeting notes & privacy notes)

Let me know if there’s anything else you need.

Best,
Jane
