Hi Alex,

Great to hear from you! I’ve gathered the core reference materials you asked for and grouped them below. Everything lives in our shared Notion space—just let me know if you have any trouble accessing the links or need alternate formats.

1. Company overview
   • Mission & Values – https://www.notion.so/InnoTech-Mission-and-Values-20e0dc8fa0db8172bbd4f8c0c4fcee86  
   • Company History – https://www.notion.so/InnoTech-Company-History-20e0dc8fa0db81ed81ddf344fcd072ad

2. Brand & visual identity
   • Brand-guidelines folder (logos, color palette, typography) – https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/BRAND-GUIDE-PUBLIC  
   (If you need native logo files in another format, just let me know and I can send them over.)

3. Product overview & positioning
   • One-page product brief – https://www.notion.so/Product-Brief-DRAFT  
   • Key value props (quick reference):
      – Real-time analytics dashboards that surface insights instantly 
      – AI-driven recommendations to help teams act faster 
      – Seamless integration with the most common business tools 
      – Flexible subscription model aimed at mid-market tech-forward companies

4. Audience / buyer-persona snapshot
   • Primary: Growth-oriented ops and analytics leads at mid-market firms (100–500 employees)  
   • Secondary: Department heads looking to unify data silos and improve decision-making  
   • Pain points we address: fragmented reporting, slow manual analysis, limited visibility into performance trends

5. Past campaign assets
   • Messaging & creative examples from the most recent launch – https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/PAST-CAMPAIGNS  
   (Feel free to reference tone, voice, and visual style as you build the new materials.)

If there’s anything else you’d like—wireframes, detailed feature specs, or additional research—just give me a shout and I’ll track it down.

Thanks again, and I’m looking forward to seeing your concepts!

Best,
Jane
