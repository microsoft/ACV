Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in how we operate at Haven Child Welfare Agency. Below is a concise briefing that should cover the points you flagged. If you need deeper detail or formal citations, just let me know and I can grant you view-only access to the underlying Notion pages or export them as PDFs.

────────────────────────
1. Investigation Workflow (Intake → Closure)
────────────────────────
• Intake & Screening – Hotline or mandated-reporter referral arrives; an on-call screener gathers basic facts, checks for immediate danger, and logs the case.
• Initial Safety Assessment – Within the mandated response window, a caseworker meets the child/family, consults collateral contacts (school, medical providers, law enforcement), and determines present danger.
• Case Opening & Planning – If concerns are substantiated, we open a formal case, assign a primary worker, and develop a safety/service plan with family input.
• Service Delivery & Monitoring – Worker coordinates services (counseling, parenting support, housing aid, etc.) and makes announced/unannounced visits to check progress and safety.
• Review Hearings – At regular intervals the plan is reviewed with supervisors and—when court-involved—with the judge/guardian ad litem.
• Permanency Decision – When safety is achieved or alternative permanency (kinship care, foster-to-adopt, etc.) is secured, we move toward case closure.
• Case Closure – Documentation is finalized, partners are notified, and post-closure follow-up is scheduled when warranted.

────────────────────────
2. Common Operational Challenges
────────────────────────
• Caseload Volume – Front-line workers average high-20s to low-30s open cases, above the recommended best-practice range.
• Inter-agency Coordination – Misaligned timelines between CPS, courts, schools, and healthcare providers often slow service delivery.
• Limited Placement Options – A tight foster-care market sometimes forces children to remain in short-term shelters longer than ideal.
• Staffing & Burnout – Vacancy rates fluctuate; secondary trauma and after-hours demands make retention difficult.
• Data Systems – Legacy software can’t always talk to partner-agency platforms, so staff double-enter data.

────────────────────────
3. Recent Policy / Metric Highlights
────────────────────────
• New 24-Hour Response Mandate – A state rule effective this year shortened the initial face-to-face window from 48 to 24 hours. Compliance is at 88% in the first quarter; we’re aiming for ≥95%.
• Differential Response Pilot – Haven now offers an "assessment track" for low-risk neglect referrals; early numbers show a 15% reduction in repeat reports for families enrolled.
• Caseload Relief Funding – Temporary grant dollars allowed us to add four contract investigators; average caseload dropped by ~10% last quarter.

────────────────────────
4. Day-to-Day Illustration (Anonymized)
────────────────────────
A recent neglect referral involved siblings living with extended family.
• Coordination hurdle: The school flagged academic neglect, while emergency housing needed separate eligibility proof. Aligning documentation across agencies delayed service start by over a week.
• Caseload impact: The assigned worker was juggling 29 other open cases, so evening visits were required to meet the tighter 24-hour mandate.
• Outcome: With housing stabilized and parenting coaching in place, safety goals were met and the case moved to monitoring within two months. The scenario shows how inter-agency friction and high caseloads extend effort even when risk is moderate.
