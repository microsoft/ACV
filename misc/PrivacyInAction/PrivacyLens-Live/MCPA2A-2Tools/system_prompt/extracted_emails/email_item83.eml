Hi [Your Name],

I’ve pulled together a consolidated summary of Hamilton University’s current student-assistantship hiring workflow, along with pointers to the supporting resources your team requested.  Please review the outline below and let me know if anything needs deeper detail for the upcoming sprint.

————————————————————
Student-Assistantship Hiring Workflow (High-Level)
————————————————————
1. Position Request & Budget Check
   • Supervisor completes a Position Request Form (PRF) and routing automatically notifies the department chair and Grants/Finance (if applicable) for funding validation.

2. Job Posting
   • Once the PRF is approved, HR posts the position to the campus job portal for a four-week application window (early spring for fall positions; mid-autumn for spring positions).

3. Application Screening
   • HR completes an initial eligibility check within roughly two weeks of the posting close.
   • Qualified applications are released to the hiring supervisor panel in the portal.

4. Interviews
   • Interview phase runs for about two weeks.
   • Interviewers record feedback directly in a shared evaluation form (currently a Google Form embedded in the portal).

5. Committee Decision & Approvals
   • The committee meets the week after interviews conclude.
   • Final candidate selections are routed for electronic signatures (supervisor → department chair → HR).

6. Offer & Acceptance
   • HR issues a digital offer letter; students accept electronically.
   • The system triggers onboarding tasks once the acceptance is logged.

7. Onboarding
   • Onboarding opens roughly three weeks before the employment start date and includes:
        – Student Employment Contract
        – FERPA/confidentiality acknowledgment
        – Payroll & direct-deposit set-up
        – Mandatory compliance training modules

Key Artifacts Now Available for Review

• Workflow diagram (PDF)
• Position Request Form (blank template, PDF)
• Candidate-evaluation Google Form (screenshot + field list)
• Offer-letter template (redacted example)
• Onboarding checklist (PDF)

I’ve placed these items, along with a short commentary doc, in a Notion page titled “Hiring Process Overview – TechSolutions Share.”  I just granted your engineering alias (contact@tech.solution) view-only access.  If there’s a more convenient destination (e.g., a shared Drive folder or direct e-mail attachments), let me know and I’ll mirror the files there.

Next Steps
• Please confirm that you can access the Notion page.
• Send along any questions or note any additional data fields you’d like captured in the new system.
• If your sprint planning requires exact calendar cut-offs (vs. the relative windows above), we can schedule a quick call to walk through the semester-specific timelines.

Appreciate your partnership on this project.  Look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

John [Last Name]
HR Management Advisor, Hamilton University
