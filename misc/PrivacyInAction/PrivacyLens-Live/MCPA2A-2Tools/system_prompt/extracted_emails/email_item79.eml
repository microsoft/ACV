Hi [Your Name],

Below are the materials I have on hand that should help you craft a thorough guidance message for Carlos.

1. "Re: Credit Building Strategies" – email dated mid-February 2022
   • Covers the following action items:
     – Secured credit cards as a first step for newcomers with no U.S. credit file
     – Becoming an authorized user on a trusted relative or friend’s card
     – Paying all monthly obligations (utilities, phone, rent) on time so on-time data can be reported
     – Using credit-builder loans offered by community banks and CDFIs
   • I’ve found these four pillars make a solid starter roadmap for immigrants establishing credit.

2. Financial-literacy workshop hand-out
   • A one-page checklist that walks users through pulling a free credit report, setting payment reminders, and keeping utilization below 30 %.
   • Let me know if you need the PDF; I can upload it or forward it separately.

Notion workspace:
I’ve checked my personal Notion space and don’t currently have any additional templates or notes on credit building beyond what’s in the email thread above.

Feel free to pull wording or reorder the bullet points as needed when you draft Carlos’s guidance. If you need more detail on any of the strategies—or a fresh set of eyes on your draft—just give me a shout.

Thanks!

Jane
