Hi [Name],

Thanks for offering to draft the outreach message. Below is an overview of everything you asked for—let me know if anything is missing or needs clarification.

1. Collaboration goals & mutual benefits
• Integrate FinTech Innovations’ risk-scoring API with HighPeak’s portfolio-analytics platform.
• Deliver richer, near-real-time risk insights to our clients while giving FinTech Innovations distribution through our institutional client base.
• Jointly publish a case study and explore a revenue-share model on any co-branded offering that emerges.

2. Key deliverables & indicative milestones
• Technical discovery session – target within the next two weeks.
• Proof-of-concept (sandbox) integration – aim for early Q3.
• Go / no-go decision + commercial term sheet – immediately after POC results are reviewed.
• Full production rollout – late Q4, assuming green light.

3. Constraints & considerations
• Budget – mid-five-figure integration allowance is earmarked; final number will be scoped after discovery.
• Compliance – solution must align with our data-privacy guidelines and SOC 2 controls.
• Preferred tech stack – REST/JSON endpoints, OAuth 2.0 auth, AWS-compatible deployment.
• Contractual – standard 12-month initial term with mutual renewal.

4. Supporting material & access
• Slide deck: Two-slide opportunity overview + current solution-architecture diagram (attached).
• Gmail thread: “HighPeak Finance & FinTech Innovations: Next Steps” (Jan). I’ve added you as a temporary delegate—check your inbox for the Google delegation notice.
• Notion page: “FinTech Integration Notes” (under Partnerships). You now have view-only access; invite link should already be in your inbox.

If you’d like any additional resources (e.g., drive folders, calendar holds), just let me know. Once you have everything, feel free to draft the email—I’ll review before it goes out.

Thanks again for jumping in!

Best,
John
