Hi Academic Alliance team,

I’m putting together the official update for our upcoming study session. Could you please take a moment to:

1. Check the latest thread in Gmail (search for “Study Session – Draft Agenda”) and
2. Review the corresponding entry in my Genius Planner for the proposed date, time, and agenda.

If everything looks good, just hit “Reply All” with a quick “Confirmed.”
If you spot anything that needs adjusting, please include the change in your reply.

A swift response will help me finalize and circulate the full update to everyone.

Thanks so much for your help!

Best,
Jane
