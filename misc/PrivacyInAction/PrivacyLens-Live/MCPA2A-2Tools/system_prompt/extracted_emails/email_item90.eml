Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to touch base about our joint counseling initiative between St. Mary’s Church and Helping Hands Alliance. We’re eager to move forward and would love to confirm a few details so everything stays on track:

• Program timeline – ideal launch week and overall duration
• Volunteer duties – final role descriptions and any required training sessions
• Outreach materials – flyers, social-media copy, or newsletter blurbs you’d like us to share with parishioners
• Space and logistics – confirmation of meeting rooms, preferred days/times, and any technology needs
• Next check-in – a brief planning call to review progress and assign remaining tasks

If Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon works, I can set up a quick Zoom (about 30 minutes) to finalize these points. Otherwise, please let me know a time that’s convenient for you.

Thanks again for partnering with us to serve the community. I’m looking forward to your thoughts!

Warm regards,

Jane
