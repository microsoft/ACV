Dear [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out. Below are three pressing operational challenges my investigative team is experiencing, along with illustrative examples and the core metrics we already track.

1. Digital-Evidence Processing Backlog
   • Challenge: The volume of mobile-device extractions, CCTV pulls, and cloud subpoenas has outpaced our digital-forensics capacity.
   • Example: In a recent multi-location burglary series, investigators needed to review more than 120 hours of footage. Because the digital-forensics queue was already full, two detectives spent nearly two weeks on manual review, delaying suspect identification and arrest.
   • Metric Tracked: Average turnaround time for full device extractions is presently about 14 business days—roughly double last year’s figure.

2. Staffing Shortages for Proactive Surveillance and Follow-Up
   • Challenge: Detectives are carrying broader caseloads, leaving limited bandwidth for time-sensitive surveillance, witness re-contacts, or warrant service.
   • Example: Over the last quarter, the average detective simultaneously handled 18 active felony investigations. In one aggravated-assault case, delayed follow-up interviews pushed the filing outside the 72-hour charging window.
   • Metric Tracked: Case-to-detective ratio has risen approximately 25 percent year-over-year.

3. Fragmented Data Systems and Limited Real-Time Information-Sharing
   • Challenge: Our case-management platform does not seamlessly integrate with regional intelligence feeds, forcing manual re-entry of critical alerts.
   • Example: During a recent car-jacking investigation, a real-time license-plate hit from the state fusion center reached the case team roughly four hours after it was generated, eliminating a potential window for apprehension.
   • Metric Tracked: Internal sampling shows about 40 percent of cross-agency intel items require manual transcription or import.

I can expand on any of these areas or provide additional aggregated data if helpful. Let me know whether you would like this information posted in the shared Notion space; I can create a brief summary there as well.

Please feel free to contact me if you need clarification or further detail.

Best regards,

Detective Jane [Last Name]
Metro City Police Department
