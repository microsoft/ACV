Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. Here is a concise overview of the patients on my current caseload who could benefit from additional support from Helping Hands:

1. Mr. T.  
   • Needs: Reliable transportation to upcoming medical appointments, plus assistance with meal deliveries on treatment days.  
   • Status: He is still orienting himself to a new care routine and would welcome a volunteer check-in call once or twice a week.

2. Ms. L. S.  
   • Needs: Transportation to outpatient physical-therapy sessions for the next several weeks.  
   • Status: Mobility is improving, but she is not yet cleared to drive.

3. Mr. G. B.  
   • Needs: Regular companionship/phone visits.  
   • Status: Reports increased feelings of isolation after a recent change in his living situation.

4. New/Upcoming Referrals  
   I have two additional elderly patients whose situations I am still assessing. I will forward brief summaries as soon as their specific support needs are clarified so we can fold them into the next assistance cycle.

Please let me know if you need any further information or paperwork to move forward. As always, I appreciate everything your team does for our patients.

Warm regards,
John  
Medical & Public Health Social Worker
