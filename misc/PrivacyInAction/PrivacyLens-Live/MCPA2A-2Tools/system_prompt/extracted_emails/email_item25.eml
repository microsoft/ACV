Hi Team,

Below is a concise, up-to-date snapshot you can drop straight into the all-staff message.

Office / Environment
• Renovation phase 1 (ground-floor common areas + break room) begins next week; expected duration is roughly one month. Temporary seating will be on upper floors.
• Ergonomic set-up for Sarah: standing desk and ergonomic chair are on order; facilities will install before renovation starts.
• Visual alert system and written-summary support for a colleague’s workspace and shared meeting rooms are being scoped with Facilities & HR; vendor quotes due this week.

Workflow / Process
• AgileBoost workflow has been adopted company-wide; initial focus is iterative planning, tighter cross-functional collaboration and quicker feedback loops.
• Pilot projects are under way in two product squads with positive early metrics (cycle time down, team satisfaction up).
• Training sessions (short virtual modules + live Q&A) roll out over the next two weeks; managers will schedule their teams.
• A lightweight retrospective template has been published in Confluence for teams to capture lessons learned.

Let me know if anything needs clarification.

Thanks!
John
