Hi GeoAnalytica Team,

I hope you’re well. Per your recent inquiry, I’ve just shared the full geotechnical data package for the Grandview Bridge project. You’ll find:

• Boring logs (BH-01 – BH-12) with SPT results  
• Laboratory test reports (grain-size, Atterberg limits, UU/CIU triaxial)  
• Ground-water monitoring records (Mar–May 2024)  
• Topographic base map (DWG + PDF) with borehole coordinates

Where to find the files  
• Email: all documents are attached in a single ZIP file (≈ 25 MB).  
• Notion: the “Grandview Bridge – Geotech” page contains the same files plus field photos and metadata.

Information we need from you  
1. Confirmation that you can access all attachments/links.  
2. A tentative timeline for your preliminary foundation recommendations.  
3. Any additional data, tests, or clarifications you require to finalize the analysis.  
4. Preferred times for a brief kickoff call (30 min) early next week.

Please let me know if there are any access issues or if something is missing. We’re keen to keep the schedule on track and will turn around any follow-up data requests as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your support on this project, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

John
