Hi [Your Name],

Here’s a brief overview and where you can find the most up-to-date information:

• Tom – continuing to progress in his post-surgery recovery and participating regularly in our community support sessions. I just tagged you on the Notion page titled “Tom’s Recovery Journey,” which contains his current care plan and any outstanding needs.

• Other active follow-ups – overall the group is engaging well with the resources supplied by Helping Hands and attending support meetings. You’re now tagged on the page “Community Wellness Program Updates,” where you’ll see a summary of collective needs, upcoming visits, and action items.

I’ve also flagged the most recent Gmail threads that mention Tom’s equipment request and the upcoming home-visit schedule so they appear under the label “For [Your Name].” Feel free to reach out if more detail would help as you prepare the report for Alex.

Thanks, and talk soon!

Best regards,
Jane
