Hi [Project Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As we continue configuring NexTech Solutions’ new performance-tracking system, we still need a few important pieces of information from your end so we can finalize system setup and rollout plans:

1. Final list of KPIs and performance dimensions to be tracked
2. Required user roles and access-level permissions (e.g., managers, HR, employees)
3. Data-integration specifications (HRIS, payroll, or other third-party tools we should connect)
4. Preferred reporting formats and frequency (dashboards, scheduled exports, etc.)
5. Security or compliance requirements unique to NexTech (e.g., data-retention policies)
6. Target dates for pilot launch and organization-wide rollout

For quick reference, please feel free to review the latest discussion points in the “Performance Tracking System” workspace on Notion, as well as last week’s email thread—both outline earlier feedback and preliminary decisions that may help you pull these details together.

Let me know if you have any questions or if we can provide additional context. Your input will ensure the system is perfectly tailored to NexTech’s needs.

Thank you very much for your assistance!

Best regards,
Jane Smith
