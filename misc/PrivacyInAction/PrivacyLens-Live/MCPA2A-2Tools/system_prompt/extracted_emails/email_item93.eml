Hi [Coordinator Name],

Welcome aboard! I’ve gathered all of the core resources you and the rest of the ConstructCo Solutions team will need for a smooth start. Everything lives in our shared Google Drive and Notion workspace so you always have the latest version.

1. Approved Drawings & Specifications
   • Google Drive  →  Folder: “01 ‑ Approved Docs”  
   • Includes the IFC drawings, technical specs, and the two most recent addenda.  
   • Direct link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/XXXXX

2. Current Project Schedule & Milestones
   • Notion  →  Page: “Master Schedule – Downtown High-Rise”  
   • The Gantt view is embedded; feel free to switch to the table view for critical-path details.  

3. Site Logistics Plan & Safety Requirements
   • Google Drive  →  Folder: “02 ‑ Site Logistics & Safety”  
   • Contains the mobilization layout, delivery routing plan, and the latest safety handbook update.

4. Contact List & Communication Protocols
   • Notion database: “Project Contacts” – searchable by company, trade, or role.  
   • Key protocol summary is pinned at the top (response times, RFI format, etc.).

5. Workspace, Drive & Calendar Access
   • Notion – you should have just received an invite: noreply@notion.so
   • Google Drive – invitation sent to this email address.  
   • Project Calendar – you’ll see the shared calendar "Downtown High-Rise – Master" in your Google Calendar list; it contains all upcoming meetings and key milestone reminders.

If anything is missing or if you have trouble accessing a link, let me know and I’ll get it sorted right away.

Looking forward to a successful collaboration. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else before the kick-off.

Best,
Jane
Civil Engineering Technician
