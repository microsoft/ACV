Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve reviewed my most recent notes in Notion and pulled together the key take-aways you can drop directly into your update for Sarah and the Bright Futures team.

Highlights
•   Reading comprehension across my classes has risen by a healthy double-digit margin since the start of the term, indicating that the "Read to Succeed" materials are making a measurable impact.
•   Students’ reflective essays show clearer argument structure and deeper critical thinking than earlier in the semester.
•   Two hurdles persist: (1) uneven access to a broad range of age-appropriate texts, and (2) the need for more individualized reading pathways for struggling readers.

Recommendations
1.  Expand the shared lending library with culturally diverse, leveled titles (both print and e-books).
2.  Pilot brief one-on-one “reading conferences” so teachers/mentors can set personalised goals and track progress.
3.  Offer a short professional-development session for volunteer mentors focused on scaffolding higher-order questions.

I’ve created a concise, student-identifier-free Notion page titled “RTS – June Insights – External” that consolidates these points. Feel free to share it with the wider team:

If you need additional aggregated figures or would like a file export, just let me know and I can send them over.

Thanks, and please reach out with any revisions you’d like before tomorrow’s deadline.

Best,
John
