Dear Disability Services Team,

I’m writing on behalf of Professor John [Last Name] as we prepare a formal reply to Mr. Thompson, the federal auditor overseeing Grandview University’s current compliance review. To ensure our response is complete and up to date, could you please share the materials listed below at your earliest convenience (ideally within the next week):

1. A concise overview of Grandview University’s disability-accommodation policies, including any recent revisions.
2. Detailed descriptions of:
   • Academic accommodations (e.g., note-taking, extended test time, captioning services)
   • Housing and dining accommodations
   • Physical accessibility features (ramps, elevators, signage, classroom layouts)
   • Technology/assistive-technology resources
3. Statistics for the current academic year:
   • Number of students registered with Disability Services
   • Most frequently requested accommodations
   • Average processing time for accommodation approvals
4. Copies or links to any training materials provided to faculty and staff on disability inclusion.
5. Contact details for the primary staff members responsible for implementing and monitoring accommodations.
6. Information on any recent or planned accessibility improvements or capital projects relevant to the audit.

Much of this data may already be outlined in the Notion workspace under “Accessibility & Compliance.” If you have updates or supplementary documents that are not yet reflected there, please either (a) upload them to the relevant Notion page or (b) reply to this email with the materials attached (PDF, Word, or links).

Please let me know if any portion of the request needs clarification. Thank you very much for your prompt assistance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
