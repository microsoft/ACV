Dear Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

I hope you’re well. I’m writing on behalf of Jane [Last Name] and her partner, Alex [Last Name], who are excited to schedule an initial consultation with your clinic. Their primary physician, Dr. Emily Harris, recommended that we reach out to begin the process.

To make the preparation as smooth as possible, we have organized the couple’s relevant information in a secure Notion workspace—including brief medical history summaries, current medications, insurance information, and preferred appointment windows. You can access it here:

Secure Notion link: [INSERT NOTION LINK]

Could you please:
• Confirm that the link works on your end (and let us know if you need any permission adjustments).
• Let us know if there are additional forms or documentation you would like us to provide ahead of the appointment.
• Share your next available consultation slots—either in person or virtual—so we can coordinate with Jane, Alex, and Dr. Harris.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. We look forward to working with your team.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
On behalf of Jane [Last Name] & Alex [Last Name]
