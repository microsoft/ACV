Hi Mark,

Thank you for your patience. Please find below the information you requested about Union Trust Bank’s customer-dispute process.

1. Summary of the Formal Workflow
• Initial filing – Customers can submit a complaint online, by phone, or in any branch. We log the case and send an acknowledgment (typically within one business day).
• Case review – A specialist gathers transaction records, merchant responses, and any supporting documents provided by the customer.
• Provisional action – For eligible debit-card or EFT disputes, provisional credit is usually issued within about ten business days while the investigation continues.
• Investigation – The review team works with the card network or merchant to verify details. Most card disputes are closed within 30–45 days; non-card complaints (fees, service quality, etc.) are generally resolved within 10 business days.
• Resolution & communication – We notify the customer in writing of the outcome and any credits or adjustments applied. If the customer disagrees, they may request an escalation.
• Escalation – Complex or unresolved matters are referred to the Customer Advocacy Team. If an impasse remains, customers are advised of their right to seek an external review by the independent Ombudsman service.

Typical Timelines
• Acknowledgment: within 1 business day
• Provisional credit (where applicable): within ~10 business days
• Final decision: 10–45 days depending on case complexity
• Escalated review: additional 15–30 days
