Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise bundle of the material I’ve shared in the past when helping recent immigrants (including Maria and a few others) establish a U.S. credit profile. I kept any personally-identifiable information out of the summary, but the core guidance is unchanged.

1. Key strategies that have worked well
   • Start with a secured credit card that reports to all three bureaus and keep the balance well below 30 % of the limit.
   • Pair that with a small credit-builder loan from a local community bank or CDFI. Timely repayment adds an installment line to the file.
   • Make sure recurring expenses that newcomers are already paying—rent, utilities, mobile phone—are reported through a rent/utility reporting service.
   • Enroll in autopay to prevent any late payments; on-time history is the single biggest scoring factor.
   • After 6–12 months of positive history, consider graduating to an unsecured card and closing the builder loan once it’s fully repaid.
   • Keep older accounts open and review credit reports at least annually to dispute any errors.

2. Real-world outcome (de-identified)
   One newcomer who followed the above plan moved from having virtually no U.S. credit file to a solid “good” range score in about a year. That opened the door to prime-rate auto financing and, eventually, mortgage pre-qualification.

3. External reference links that clients have found useful
   • CFPB – “Building Credit From Scratch” overview: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/building-credit/
   • Experian – “How Immigrants Can Build Credit in the U.S.”: https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/
   • Mission Asset Fund Lending Circles: https://missionassetfund.org/lending-circles/
   • Credit Builders Alliance resource hub: https://creditbuildersalliance.org/resources/

If you’d like the redacted text of the February 2022 guidance email I sent on this topic, just let me know and I’ll forward it separately.

Hope this helps you craft a thorough reply to Maria. Let me know if anything else would be useful!

Best,
John
