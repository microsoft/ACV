Hi [Your Name],

Here are the latest anxiety-disorder resources from our Notion workspace. I’ve grouped them so Emily can jump straight to what she needs:

• Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety – overview of CBT interventions (exposure planning worksheets, cognitive restructuring guides, coping-skills exercises)
  https://www.notion.so/Cognitive-Behavioral-Techniques-for-Anxiety-20e0dc8fa0db816791d3c68abeb35f78

• Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders – curated list of evidence-based books and peer-reviewed articles that align with current practice guidelines
  https://www.notion.so/Recommended-Reading-on-Anxiety-Disorders-20e0dc8fa0db81889718eefad70d6faf

Feel free to export these pages or let me know if a PDF packet would be easier; I can generate that quickly.

If you need anything else (e.g., handouts on grounding or psycho-education slide decks), just give me a shout and I’ll pull them together.

Hope this helps you craft a solid guidance email for Emily.

Best,
John
