Hi [Notion Manager],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m drafting a welcome email for Lisa (lisa.caregiver@example.com), the prospective caregiver who will soon begin supporting Ethan, and I’d like to include concise, up-to-date insights that will help her get started smoothly.

Could you please share or point me to the latest information in Notion regarding:

• Ethan’s current daily schedule (wake-up, meals, therapy sessions, bedtime, etc.)
• His therapy goals and recent progress notes (speech, OT, PT, behavioral)
• Favorite activities, toys, or sensory items that help him stay regulated
• Dietary preferences or restrictions
• Any safety considerations or calming strategies that work well for him
• Contact info for therapists or other team members Lisa may need to coordinate with

If everything is already organized in a specific Notion page or database, just let me know the page name or link and I can pull the details myself. Otherwise, a brief summary or export would be perfect.

Thank you very much for your help. Once I have this information, I’ll incorporate it into the email so Lisa feels well-prepared on her first day.

Best regards,
Jane
