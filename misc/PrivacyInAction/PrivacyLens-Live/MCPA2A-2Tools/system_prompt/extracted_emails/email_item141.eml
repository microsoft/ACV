Hi Ethan,

Great to hear from you. Below is the consolidated cover-design brief and technical guidance for Clara Bellamy’s forthcoming novel, “Whispers of the Past.”  These points bring together everything we currently have in Notion plus our standard production specs.

— 1. Creative Direction —
•  Mood & Tone: A quiet sense of mystery mixed with nostalgia.
•  Key Motifs: An antique, ornate key and a faded, handwritten letter (both are central symbols in the story).
•  Colour Palette: Muted earth tones—warm sepia, dusty olive, and soft charcoal accents.  Think aged paper and weathered metal rather than anything overly saturated.
•  Texture: A subtle paper grain or light crackle can reinforce the “found-in-an-attic” feel.

— 2. Format & Print Specs —
•  Trim Size: Trade paperback, 6” × 9”.  (We’ll confirm final spine width once the interior page count is locked.)
•  Layout: Full wrap-around (front, spine, back) with 0.125” bleed on all sides.
•  Resolution & Colour Space: 300 dpi, CMYK.
•  Safe Zone: Keep all critical text/imagery at least 0.25” inside the trim.

— 3. Typography —
•  Title: Prominent, classic serif—legible at thumbnail size.
•  Author Name: Slightly smaller; a complementary sans-serif or clean transitional serif works well.
•  Avoid decorative scripts or distressed fonts that might compete with the key/letter visuals.

— 4. Back-Cover Elements —
•  Space for ~150-word marketing blurb.
•  Barcode box (2” × 1.2”) in lower-right corner.
•  Griffin & Locke logo in lower-left corner.

— 5. Deliverables & Timeline —
•  3–4 initial concept thumbnails by early next week (exact date is flexible—let me know what works for you).
•  One concept selected for refinement with up to two revision rounds.
•  Final files: print-ready PDF, layered source file (AI or PSD), and a high-res RGB JPEG (≈3000 px tall) for e-commerce listings.

— 6. Story Context (excerpt from our internal design brief) —
“The cover should evoke a sense of mystery and nostalgia.  The main elements to include are an old, ornate key and a faded letter.  The colour scheme should be muted earth tones.  Please refer to the story synopsis and author bio for further thematic context.”

I’ll forward the full synopsis and bio in a separate message once they’ve cleared copy-editing, but the above should be enough to get you started on concepting.

Let me know if anything needs clarification, or if you have a different creative angle you’d like to explore—happy to discuss.

Thanks so much, and looking forward to your ideas!

Best,
Jane
