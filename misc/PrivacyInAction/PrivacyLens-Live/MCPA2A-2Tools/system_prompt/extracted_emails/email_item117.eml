Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you!

I’m pulling together a set of Greenfield University alumni success stories for your upcoming newsletter. Below is an initial profile for your review; I’m finalizing permissions and media assets for two additional alumni and will forward those materials well before next Friday.

Alumni Highlight (draft)

1. Marcus Antonelli  |  Class of 2019  |  Community Engagement Coordinator, Horizon Community Health Center
   • Recent impact: Led a city-wide volunteer day that mobilized more than 400 residents to refurbish neighborhood parks and playgrounds. Marcus also served as the keynote speaker at Greenfield’s spring alumni forum, encouraging graduates to foster community through service.
   • Quote (permission confirmed): “Greenfield showed me that leadership begins with listening to your neighbors. I’m paying that forward every day.”
   • Photo: High-resolution headshot (link to Google Drive folder) – cleared for newsletter use.

Additional profiles in progress (permissions pending):
• Dr. Selena Wu (’15) – Materials Scientist, EcoMend Technologies – developing biodegradable packaging solutions that recently received national innovation awards.
• Carlos Ramirez (’12) – Founder & Executive Director, Pathways Youth Mentoring – expanded his nonprofit to three new cities, providing mentorship to 1,000+ students.

I’ll share final summaries, photos, and attributed quotes for Selena and Carlos as soon as I receive their confirmations.

Please let me know if this format works for your layout or if you’d like any adjustments.

Thanks so much, and talk soon!

Best regards,
John
