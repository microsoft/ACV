Hi [Your Name],

I did a thorough search of our Notion workspace and, surprisingly, couldn’t locate a page titled "Admissions Cycle 2024–2025" (or any variation of it). The latest Admissions overview we have documented is for 2022–2023.

It’s possible the 2024–2025 notes were created in a private section, saved under a different name, or simply haven’t been entered yet. If you can point me to the exact page (or share the link), I’ll be happy to pull the requested key points right away.

In the meantime, I’ll keep an eye out for any newly added admissions-cycle material and flag anything that looks time-sensitive or especially exciting.

Thanks and sorry for the extra step!

Best,
John
