Hi [Name],

Thanks for the quick follow-up. All of the requested biometric-scanner documents are now in one place:

• Hardware specifications, model numbers, network/power requirements and full API guide – Notion page “Biometric Scanner Technical Specifications”.
• Access-control procedures (incl. credential tiers) and the step-by-step install checklist – Notion page “Biometric Scanner Installation – AeroSecure Access”.  
  ‑ For security reasons I’ll transfer the initial system credentials to you through SecureTech’s encrypted vault later today rather than putting them in email.
• Checkpoint placement/layout drawings – shared-drive folder “Heathrow_T5_BioScan_Layouts” (each subfolder holds the latest PDF and CAD for its lane).
• Project timeline & milestones – see the “Timeline” toggle at the top of the Technical Specifications page.

If you or the SecureTech team need additional permissions to view the pages or download files, just let me know and I’ll grant access right away.

Please confirm that everything opens correctly on your end so we can stay on schedule for tomorrow afternoon.

Best regards,
Jane
