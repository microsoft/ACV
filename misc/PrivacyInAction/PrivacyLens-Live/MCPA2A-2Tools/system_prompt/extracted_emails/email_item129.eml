Hi Mark,

Here’s a concise overview drawn from my most recent notes and session records:

Thomas
• Engagement: Continues to participate actively in both individual and group work, often taking a supportive role with peers.
• Recent Milestone: Identified key personal factors contributing to past setbacks and is integrating new coping strategies.
• Upcoming: Routine individual check-in scheduled in the near term; considering referral to a mindfulness skills workshop.
• Focus Areas: Monitor occasional spikes in self-doubt/anxiety and reinforce use of coping skills between sessions.

Emily
• Engagement: Attending all appointments consistently and demonstrating steady progress toward stated goals.
• Recent Milestone: Expressed readiness to broaden her support system by exploring volunteer opportunities in the community.
• Upcoming: Brief meeting with our vocational-support counselor is on the calendar to explore suitable activities.
• Focus Areas: Encourage balance so added commitments complement, rather than compete with, her recovery plan.

Let me know if you’d like any additional detail or to set up a quick call to discuss joint next steps.

Best,
Jane
Serenity Wellness Center
