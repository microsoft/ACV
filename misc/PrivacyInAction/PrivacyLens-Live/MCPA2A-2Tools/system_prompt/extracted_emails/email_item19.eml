Dear Mrs. Thompson,

I hope you’re well.

Per your request, I’m sending Timmy Martin’s most recent school health information:

• Immunizations: Timmy is fully up-to-date with all state-required childhood vaccines for the coming school year. A summary record is attached for your files.

• Asthma: Timmy occasionally requires a rescue inhaler for exercise-induced symptoms. Please ensure that his inhaler is readily available during physical education classes and outdoor activities. No dosage change since the last form on file.

• Allergies & Medications: Timmy has no food or medication allergies that require school accommodations, and he does not need scheduled medication during school hours.

• Activity Restrictions: None.

If you need any additional documentation or would like me to complete specific school forms, just let me know and I’ll be happy to assist.

Best regards,

Dr. Jane
