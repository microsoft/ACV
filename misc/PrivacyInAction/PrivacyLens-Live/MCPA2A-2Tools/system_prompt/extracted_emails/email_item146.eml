Hi [Your Name],

As requested, I’ve gathered the latest assets for the Metro Health Authority (MHA) health-tracking system and placed everything in one location for easy reference.

1. Functional-Requirements Document
   • View-only link: https://www.notion.so/Health-Tracking-System-Requirements-20f0dc8fa0db81ce89bde8c195c7b4bc  
   • PDF export has also been uploaded to the shared Notion page under “Documents”.

2. Design Mock-ups / Wireframes
   • Preliminary dashboard and data-entry screen designs are now in the shared Figma project “MHA-Health-Tracking – Draft UI”.  
   • Direct Figma link is included on the same Notion page in the “Design Assets” section.

3. Anonymized Sample Data Sets
   • A ZIP archive containing de-identified sample CSVs (vitals, activity levels, and survey responses) has been added to the “Data Sets” section of the Notion space.  
   • All personal identifiers have been removed and small-cell counts have been aggregated in line with MHA privacy policy.

4. Target Timeline & Major Milestones
   • System design sign-off – mid-spring  
   • Prototype ready for internal testing – early summer  
   • Production rollout – early autumn  
   Preferred delivery format: secure, REST-based JSON API accompanied by a responsive web dashboard.

5. Repositories / Sandboxes / APIs
   • GitHub repository: https://github.com/MetroHealthAuthority/mha-health-tracking (access invite issued to your team’s shared account).  
   • Sandbox API endpoint: https://sandbox.mha.gov/api/v1  
   • Please use the personal access token sent to your team lead via our secure key-exchange channel.

If any other information would help finalize the development brief, just let me know and I’ll be happy to supply it.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Jane Doe  
Public Health Service Officer
