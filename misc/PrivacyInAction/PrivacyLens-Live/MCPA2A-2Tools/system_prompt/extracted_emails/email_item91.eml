Hi Sarah,

Below is a concise snapshot you can drop into the team update. I’ll also plug the same details (plus a little more depth) into the Notion pages first thing tomorrow morning so it is all in one place.

HEAP – Health Empowerment & Awareness Program
• Recent milestone: the latest community workshop series wrapped up successfully and the post-session survey shows strong engagement.
• Current focus: distributing the newly printed information packets through partner organizations later this week.
• Next milestone: complete final edits to the online resource library and schedule its soft launch for early next month.
• Action items before the next check-in:
  – Compile and summarize workshop feedback.
  – Coordinate volunteer schedules for the packet drop-offs.
  – Draft social-media posts to promote the upcoming web resources.

Vax4All – Community Vaccination Drive
• Recent milestone: agreement secured with an additional healthcare partner, which gives us another pop-up clinic location.
• Logistics update: vaccine supply order confirmed and in transit; arrival expected in the next couple of weeks.
• Next milestone: finalize the volunteer roster and confirm clinic dates for early summer.
• Action items before the next check-in:
  – Submit permit request for the weekend pop-up site.
  – Update outreach materials to reflect the new clinic partner.
  – Begin volunteer orientation planning.

Let me know if anything else would help. I’ll make sure the Notion pages are refreshed well before noon tomorrow so you can pull anything additional you need.

Thanks,
John
