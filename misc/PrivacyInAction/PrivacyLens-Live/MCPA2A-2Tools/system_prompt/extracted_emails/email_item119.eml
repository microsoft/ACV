Hi [Your Name],

Below is the information you requested so you can put together a consolidated brief for Mary:

1. Design briefs / author notes
   • “Whispers of the Ancients” – Historical-fantasy that blends ancient myths with a cosmic thread. Central ideas: mysterious ruins, starlit skies, subtle suggestion of constellations guiding the protagonists.
   • “The Last Alchemist” – Renaissance-era intrigue focused on secret knowledge and moral ambiguity. Key visual cues: alchemical symbols, shadow-cloaked figure, dim candle-lit laboratory atmosphere.
   • “A Dance of Shadows” – Wartime romance and betrayal. Possible motifs: silhouettes dancing around firelight, contrast between intimacy and impending conflict.

2. Reference imagery / mood-board elements already discussed
   – Ancient stone arches and celestial maps for “Whispers”.
   – Classic alchemy diagrams and weathered manuscripts for “The Last Alchemist”.
   – Flickering camp-fire silhouettes and torn battle standards for “A Dance of Shadows”.
   (No formal mood-board files yet; Mary will develop them once she receives the written direction.)

3. Preferred dimensions, file formats & print specs
   • Trim size: trade paperback, approx. 6" × 9" front cover plus 0.125" bleed on all sides.
   • Full jacket (front / spine / back) to be delivered as press-ready PDF (CMYK, 300 dpi) and layered PSD for our archive.

4. Deadlines / milestones
   • Author agency would like visual concepts approved later this month so final art can be locked before first-pass pages.

5. Brand / style guidelines
   • Color palettes: A set of complementary schemes has been approved by our design team (document attached in the “Finalized Color Schemes” email). Please give Mary latitude to adjust saturation as needed while staying within those ranges.
   • Typography: Our standard house faces—Cinzel (serif) for titles, Lato for subtitles/author names. Alternate display faces acceptable if they reinforce the genre tone.
   • Imagery: Avoid overt photo realism; aim for painterly or illustrated treatments that can read well at thumbnail size.

6. Other notes for Mary
   • Ensure hierarchy is clear: Series title (if any) < Book title < Author name.
   • Provide at least three rough concepts per title so authors have options.
   • Keep spine text within 0.125" safe zone to accommodate binding variance.

Let me know if you need any additional detail or if you’d like me to forward the color-scheme email chain for reference.

Best,
John
