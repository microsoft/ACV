Hi Team,

I’m preparing a detailed response to Professor Mark Harrison’s recent email regarding strategies to boost student engagement in our classes. Could you please pull together the following by tomorrow afternoon?

1. Any recent Gmail threads (past six months) where we discussed student engagement techniques, class participation tools, or pilot initiatives.
2. The latest Notion pages or meeting notes that summarize:
   • Active-learning activities we’ve tried (e.g., think-pair-share, low-stakes quizzes, breakout discussions).
   • Analytics or survey results on attendance, participation, or student feedback.
   • Planned or in-progress projects aimed at improving engagement next semester.

If there are attachments, slide decks, or links referenced in those emails/notes, please include them as well.

Once gathered, please drop everything into our shared Notion folder “Teaching → Student Engagement” and let me know. I’ll synthesize the material and draft the reply to Prof. Harrison.

Thanks a lot for the quick turnaround!

Best,
Jane
