Dear Sunny Days Families,

I hope you are all doing wonderfully!

I’ve just posted the newest peek into your children’s day-to-day life at Sunny Days Childcare Center on our Notion page. You’ll find:

• Photos and highlights from last week’s “Garden Explorers” theme  
• A short summary of each age group’s activities and developmental milestones  
• Upcoming events (Field Day on 6/14, Father’s Day breakfast, summer water-play schedule)  
• A few helpful tips for extending our classroom learning at home

Could you please take a moment this week to:

1. Visit our Notion workspace to read the full update (link below).  
2. Let me know—via reply email—if you have any questions, feedback, or ideas you’d like us to incorporate into future plans.

Your insights help us tailor our program to each child’s needs, and we truly value your partnership.

Thank you for being such supportive members of our Sunny Days community. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Warmest regards,
