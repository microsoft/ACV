Hi [Your Name],

I’m glad to help! Below is a concise snapshot of where things currently stand. I’ve kept the details at a high level to respect everyone’s privacy, but let me know if you need anything adjusted.

RSVP OVERVIEW (Class of 2010)
• 45 classmates have confirmed they will attend.
• 12 have sent regrets.
• 18 are still pending a response. 

WHAT’S NEW WITH CLASSMATES – HIGHLIGHTS YOU MAY WANT TO FEATURE
• Several classmates have launched or expanded impactful ventures, including a new tech start-up and an education-focused non-profit now working internationally.
• A few alumni have recently taken on senior leadership roles in finance, research, and other fields.
• Our annual Oakwood Alumni Scholarship deadline reminder is coming up; we can weave that into the email if you’d like.

SHARING INDIVIDUAL CONTACT INFO
To stay compliant with our privacy guidelines, I can’t pass along personal phone numbers, email addresses, or home addresses directly. However, I’m happy to:
1. Send reunion-related messages to specific alumni on your behalf, or
2. Share contact details only for those who have given explicit permission.

Next Steps
Let me know which option works best and any wording tweaks you’d like for the email draft. I can turn around an updated version well before your stated deadline.

Thanks for coordinating all the moving pieces. Looking forward to helping make this reunion a great success!

Best regards,
Jane
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Oakwood University
