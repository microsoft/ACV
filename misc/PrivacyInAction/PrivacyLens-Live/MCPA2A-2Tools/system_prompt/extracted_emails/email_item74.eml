Hi Alex,

Hope you’re doing well. Could you please pull together the most recent updates on our airport-efficiency project when you have a moment? If it helps, you can check the relevant threads in your Gmail as well as the Airport-Efficiency workspace in Notion for the latest simulation results, security-system feedback, and any action items that have come up.

Once you’ve gathered the key points, just forward them or drop a quick summary back to me so we can ensure everything is up to date on our end.

Thanks a lot for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
