Hi Jane,

Below is a concise package of information you can use when replying to Mark’s questions about branch procedures.

1. Summary of Mark’s request
• Mark would like clarification on the day-to-day steps for handling customer inquiries and the correct protocol for escalating or reporting issues.

2. Key resource in Notion
• Bank Procedures Overview – https://www.notion.so/Bank-Procedures-Overview-20e0dc8fa0db8165ad9ff9ab31b3fbc1  
  – Verifying customer identity (ID check, dual-authentication questions).  
  – Standard transaction flow (deposit, withdrawal, account maintenance).  
  – Escalation path: if an issue cannot be resolved at the window, the teller opens a Help Desk ticket via the internal portal or emails internal-help@trustwellbank.com.  
  – Urgent matters: notify the on-duty supervisor immediately and record the incident in the branch log.

3. Recommended talking points for your reply to Mark
• Emphasise the importance of following the identity-verification checklist before discussing any account information.  
• Remind him to document every customer interaction in the teller system notes.  
• Point him to the Help Desk process for operational questions and to the branch log for incidents (equipment issues, security concerns, cash discrepancies).  
• Let him know that the Bank Procedures Overview page is kept up to date and should be his primary reference; encourage bookmarking it.

Please let me know if you’d like more detail or additional materials.

Best,
[Your Name]
On behalf of Branch Operations Support
