Hi [Your Name],

Below is the most up-to-date, concise snapshot I can provide at this point.

• Scope & timeline
  – Leadership is still in an exploratory phase. No final restructuring framework has been approved.
  – Earliest possible implementation window that has been floated is the next fiscal quarter, but this is provisional and dependent on executive-board sign-off.

• Departmental restructuring / role impacts
  – Current drafts focus on streamlining management layers and improving cross-functional collaboration; no head-count reductions or specific role removals have been authorized.
  – Any realignment, if adopted, is expected to be phased in to minimise disruption to in-flight projects.

• Confirmed milestones / decision points
  – Executive review meeting later this month to decide whether to move the draft forward for wider consultation.
  – If green-lit, HR will begin a formal impact-assessment and communication plan, followed by a company-wide announcement shortly after.

• Interim guidance for managers & staff
  – Reassure teams that no immediate changes are taking place and that day-to-day project priorities remain unchanged.
  – Direct any detailed questions to HR so we can keep messaging consistent and reduce speculation.
  – Encourage teams to document critical processes; this will help if we do enter a transition period.

I’ll continue monitoring both the executive board discussions and any fresh correspondence. Let me know if you need anything clarified before you respond to Mark.

Best,
Jane
