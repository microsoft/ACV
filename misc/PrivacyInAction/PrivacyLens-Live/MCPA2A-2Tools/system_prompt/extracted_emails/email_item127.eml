Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m working on a complex litigation matter for one of our clients at Carter & Associates and would greatly value your strategic perspective.

At your convenience, could you please review the case materials and share any insights or recommendations you might have? I’ve placed a concise case summary, key pleadings, and our preliminary strategy memo in the “Client XYZ – Litigation” workspace on Notion, and I can grant you access to any additional documents you might need.

If it would be helpful, I’m happy to set up a brief call to walk you through the particulars and answer any questions. Kindly let me know a suitable time, or feel free to propose an alternative.

Thank you in advance for your guidance.

Warm regards,

Jane
