Hi Sarah,

As discussed, please find attached an encrypted ZIP archive containing the client financial datasets you'll need to develop the comprehensive tax strategy. The archive includes:

• Prior-year tax returns
• Current-year trial balances and detailed ledgers
• Supporting schedules (depreciation, capital gains, etc.)
• Relevant correspondence with taxing authorities

The file is encrypted in accordance with our standard secure-transfer protocol. I will send the password to you via SMS shortly under separate cover.

Please let me know if you have any trouble accessing the files or if you need additional information.

Best regards,
John
