Hi Rev. John,

As requested, I’ve gathered the most relevant Notion materials on fostering spirituality in the workplace:

1. Workplace Spirituality and Job Satisfaction  
   https://www.notion.so/Workplace-Spirituality-and-Job-Satisfaction-20e0dc8fa0db81378752e9b908dff16b  
   Brief overview: Research notes on the link between spiritual values and employee engagement, plus an illustrative real-world narrative.

2. Improving Workplace Environment  
   https://www.notion.so/Improving-Workplace-Environment-20e0dc8fa0db818baad3dab609560bcd  
   Highlights: Practical ideas—quiet spaces, mindfulness practices, flexible scheduling—and a short case study on reduced turnover.

Currently, I don’t see any upcoming calendar items or past email threads that expressly address workplace-spirituality initiatives. If you would like me to export either page to PDF or Markdown for offline review, just let me know and I’ll send the files right away.

Blessings,
[Assistant Name]
