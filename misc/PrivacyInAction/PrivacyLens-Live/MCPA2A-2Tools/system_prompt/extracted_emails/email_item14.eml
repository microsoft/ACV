Hi [Your Name],

I’ve reviewed all recent HealthHub-related material in both Gmail and our Notion workspace. Below is the consolidated view of what’s currently documented:

1. Core Requirements
• Seamless integration with OptiLife’s existing employee-wellness programs.
• Tracking of individual employee health goals (e.g., steps, nutrition, activity).
• Delivery of personalized health insights via an employee dashboard.
• A catalog of wellness challenges to drive engagement.

2. Recent Feature Requests
• No new feature requests have been logged in email or Notion since the last review.

3. Timeline Changes
• No timeline adjustments or milestone shifts are documented at this time; the planned launch window remains as previously discussed.

4. Compliance Notes
• No additional compliance requirements have been added in the latest materials.

Let me know if you’d like me to dig into any other sources or clarify anything further before you draft the update for Vitality Partners.

Best,
Jane
