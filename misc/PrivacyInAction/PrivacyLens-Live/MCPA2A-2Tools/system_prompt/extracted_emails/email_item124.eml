Hi there,

Could you please open “The Muse’s Ledger” in Notion and pull together 3–4 concise, engaging insights or teaching techniques that best illustrate the approach I use in my creative-writing classes? For each point, could you include:
• A brief description of the technique/insight
• One line on why it tends to resonate with students
• A short illustrative example, if there’s one handy

I’m drafting an introductory note to a new contact, Emily, and I’d love to weave these highlights in. If possible, could I have the bullet points by noon today? Thanks very much for the quick help!

Best,
John
