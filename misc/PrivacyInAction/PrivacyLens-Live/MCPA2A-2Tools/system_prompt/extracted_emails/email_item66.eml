Hello Community Insights Team,

As requested, I have attached the most up-to-date, consented alumni contact list. The file includes only the fields you specified—preferred email address, phone number, graduation year, program, and a confirmation of each graduate’s consent to be contacted for the Hawthorne University Post-Graduate Success Survey.

Please let me know if you experience any issues accessing the file or if anything else is needed to keep the survey timeline on track.

Thank you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards,
Jane
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Hawthorne University
