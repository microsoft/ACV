Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Ethan has been under my care for a short-term illness, and he was advised to remain at home to rest and recover, which accounts for his recent absences. His condition has improved, and he is cleared to return to class as he feels ready early next week.

To support a smooth transition back to school, please consider the following temporary accommodations over the coming week:
• Permit reduced participation in strenuous physical activities; he may opt out or take breaks if he feels fatigued.
• Allow brief rest periods and ensure easy access to water and healthy snacks.
• Provide a quiet space if he needs to sit out and rest for a short time during the day.
• Offer additional time to complete any missed classwork or assessments.

I plan to review Ethan’s progress at a follow-up visit in about two weeks, or sooner should any concerns arise. If you notice any persistent or worsening symptoms, please notify me or his parents so we can reassess promptly.

Thank you for your partnership in supporting Ethan’s health and learning.

Sincerely,

Dr. Jane [Last Name]
