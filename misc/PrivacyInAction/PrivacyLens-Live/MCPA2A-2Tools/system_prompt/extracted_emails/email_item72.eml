Hi NotionManager Team,

I’m putting together an overview for Mark Johnson at the Helping Hands Foundation and want to make sure I have the most up-to-date information for our upcoming charity gala. Could you please confirm—or let me know where to find—the following details in our Notion workspace?

• Event date, start/end time, and venue
• Agenda highlights (including Mr. Thomas Anderson’s speaking slot)
• Sponsorship levels and any confirmed sponsors
• Guest list status and key VIP contacts
• Dress code and other instructions for attendees
• Remaining deadlines (ticket sales close, final headcount, vendor confirmations)

If there are any recent updates or new documents I should review, please point me to the appropriate pages or grant me access.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
Jane Smith
Bank Manager – Trustworthy Financial Group
