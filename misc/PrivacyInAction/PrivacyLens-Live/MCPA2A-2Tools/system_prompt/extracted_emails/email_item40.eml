Dear Scholarship Program Coordinator,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Michael Smith’s application. I’m happy to help.

• Official transcript – I will upload Michael’s most recent, school-certified transcript (including both weighted and unweighted GPA information) directly to your secure portal by the end of this week.

• Awards & honors (past two school years – condensed overview)
  – Earned top placement at a regional STEM fair for an engineering project.
  – Elected Student Council president and led the annual charity initiative benefiting local shelters.
  – Serves as captain of the debate team and has advanced to state-level rounds.

• Advanced coursework (current or completed)
  – AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP U.S. History, and Dual-Enrollment English Composition.

• Additional context
  – Recently completed a self-directed capstone focused on renewable-energy design that was showcased at the district STEM exhibition.

Ms. Thompson’s recommendation letter is finalized; I will forward a PDF copy to the same portal alongside the transcript.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need or if another format would be more convenient.

Warm regards,

John [Last Name]
Guidance Counselor | Oakwood High School
