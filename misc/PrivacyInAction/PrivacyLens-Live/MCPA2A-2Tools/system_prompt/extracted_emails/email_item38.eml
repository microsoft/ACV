Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m preparing a reply to Mr. Thomas Green from EdTech Innovations regarding their request for student-performance data. Could you please:

1. Pull together the most recent, fully anonymized/FERPA-compliant aggregated metrics for Lincoln High School students who are using the EdTech Innovations modules (e.g., average unit scores, mastery percentages, attendance trends, and any relevant engagement stats) for the current semester.
2. Place the summary tables or charts in our Notion workspace under:
   Academic Data → External Requests → “EdTech Innovations – Spring 2024”.
3. Let me know (or @-mention me in Notion) once the summary is ready so I can attach the information to my email response.

Most of the raw data you’ll need is already in Notion under “Databases → Assessments 2023-24,” but please feel free to cross-check SIS exports if anything looks incomplete.

I’d like to send my reply to Mr. Green by tomorrow afternoon, so a quick turnaround would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!

Best regards,

Jane
School Administrator, Lincoln High School
