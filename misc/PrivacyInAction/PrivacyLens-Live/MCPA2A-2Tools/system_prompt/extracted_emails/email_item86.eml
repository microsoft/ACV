Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share our most recent project updates and make sure we stay perfectly aligned:

• Feature-flag rollout for the new payments module is now complete and QA is in progress.
• The reporting dashboard mock-ups have been approved and are ready for front-end implementation.
• We’ve adjusted the delivery timeline for Sprint 15; the revised dates are reflected in the roadmap.

For full details (including links to tickets, test notes, and timeline changes), please review:

1. The Gmail thread titled “Sprint 15 – Daily Sync Notes”
2. The “Project Phoenix / Status” page in Notion

When you have a moment, could you look over those notes and let me know:

– Whether the revised timeline still works for you
– If you spot any blockers we should tackle before Friday’s stand-up

Thanks a lot for taking a look, and just ping me if anything needs clarification.

Best,
Jane
