Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. Per your request, I have gathered the most recent analyses from our remote learning study. To safeguard participant privacy, I have removed all personally identifying information and consolidated the findings into the overview below.

Remote Learning Study – Key Updated Findings
------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cohort Size & Scope
  – More than 300 undergraduate students across three academic departments participated in the most recent data-collection cycle.

• Performance Trends (Remote vs. In-Person)
  – Average course scores in remote sections increased by roughly three percentage points compared with the last fully in-person semester.
  – Grade-distribution tables (attached below) illustrate a small shift toward higher mid-range grades, with no significant change in the proportion of top or failing marks.

• Engagement & Attendance
  – Median session-attendance rate for synchronous online classes remained above 90 % throughout the term.
  – 87 % of respondents reported that they felt “engaged” or “very engaged” during remote sessions, a modest improvement over last year’s figure.

• Assignment Completion
  – Timely submission rates rose from 78 % to 84 % following the introduction of short weekly check-in polls.

• Qualitative Insights
  – Students consistently cited schedule flexibility and recorded lectures as the strongest positives.
  – The most frequently mentioned challenge was reduced informal peer interaction; discussion-board participation correlated strongly (> 0.6) with higher final grades.

• Next Steps
  – We are running a short follow-up survey this month focused on long-term skill retention.
  – Updated regression analyses (controlling for prior GPA and program) will be added to the shared workspace once complete.

Please let me know if you would like a deeper dive into any specific area or if additional visualizations would be helpful for your upcoming departmental briefing.

Thank you, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
John
