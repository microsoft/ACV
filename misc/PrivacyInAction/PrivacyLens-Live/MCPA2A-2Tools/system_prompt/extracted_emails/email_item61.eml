Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise snapshot of our most recent developments that Maria may want to include in her upcoming community bulletin:

1. Case Updates
• Carlos – The matter is moving forward. We have a strategy meeting planned for next week to decide the next procedural steps. I’ll share any key outcomes as soon as they’re available.

2. Community Workshops
• Immigrant Rights Workshop Series – Three sessions are scheduled for early March at the local resource center. Planned topics include: navigating immigration processes, employment resources, basic financial literacy, and building community connections.

3. Free Legal Clinic
• A walk-in legal advice clinic is set for late February at the downtown community venue. Volunteer attorneys will be on hand to discuss a range of civil legal issues.

Feel free to tweak wording or rearrange as needed before forwarding to Maria. Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
John
