Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m preparing the official update for our team and partners and want to ensure I capture everything accurately. Could you please take a moment to look over the points below and let me know if anything needs to be added, corrected, or clarified?

1. Recent Activities
   • Community food-drive recap (250 families served last Saturday)
   • After-school tutoring program expansion to two additional schools
   • Partnership meeting with GreenCity Recycling finalized (pilot starts next month)

2. Upcoming Charity Event with St. Mary’s Parish (Sat, 18 May)
   • Venue confirmed: St. Mary’s Community Hall & courtyard
   • Volunteer slots: 45/60 filled as of today
   • Sponsorship status: three local businesses pledged in-kind donations (valued at ≈ $4,500)
   • Promo timeline: social-media posts scheduled for next week; parish bulletin insert drafted

All related notes, contact lists, and the event run-sheet are on the “Charity Event – May” page in Notion. Feel free to check the shared calendar for timing details as well.

Could you let me know by EOD tomorrow if everything looks good or if you’d like any adjustments? Your feedback will help us circulate a final update promptly.

Thanks so much for your time and help, Sarah!

Best regards,
John
