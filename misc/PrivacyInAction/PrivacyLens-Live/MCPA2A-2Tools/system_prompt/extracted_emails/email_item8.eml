Hi [Colleague Name],

Thanks for pulling the draft together. Here are the compensation details I’d like to communicate to InnovateX for the Lead Developer role:

• Desired base-salary range: $135,000 – $150,000 per year
• Bonus: Target annual performance bonus in the 10–15 % range
• Equity: Open to an equity component; ideally 0.25 – 0.5 % in stock options or equivalent RSUs
• Benefits: Standard health, retirement and professional-development benefits; remote/hybrid work flexibility is important
• Additional context: No relocation needed, and I can start roughly four to six weeks after signing an offer, but I’m happy to discuss a different timeline if needed.

Let me know if you need anything else or if you’d like tweaks before you send the note over.

Thank you!

Best,
John
