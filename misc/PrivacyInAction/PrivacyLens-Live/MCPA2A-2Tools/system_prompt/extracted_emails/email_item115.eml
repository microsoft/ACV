Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’ve put together a set of ideas aimed at enhancing passenger flow while maintaining (and, where possible, strengthening) security throughout the terminal. Key themes include:

• Dynamic queue allocation driven by live sensor data  
• Parallel tray-loading zones to accelerate security throughput  
• Remote bag-drop and verification for trusted travellers and crew  
• Re-sequenced wayfinding that separates O&D from transfer passengers  
• Centrally located concessions to redistribute dwell time

The complete write-up—along with diagrams and supporting research—is in our shared Notion workspace (“Passenger Flow Optimisation – v1”). Whenever convenient, could you please:

1. Review the concepts and flag the ones you feel warrant deeper modelling.  
2. Let me know of any operational or regulatory constraints I may have overlooked.  
3. Suggest next steps or additional data you’d like me to gather before our next design iteration.

Your guidance will help me prioritise the most promising solutions before we move into simulation and cost-benefit analysis.

Thank you very much for your time and expertise. I look forward to your feedback.

Warm regards,
