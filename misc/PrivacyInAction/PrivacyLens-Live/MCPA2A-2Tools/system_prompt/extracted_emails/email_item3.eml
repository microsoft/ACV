Hi Lisa,

I hope you’re doing well! As one of your frequent buyers, I’m planning a few upcoming orders and wanted to check whether there are any current or soon-to-launch discount programs I could take advantage of.

I noticed several attractive offers listed on MyDealFinder and wondered if MarketHub has similar—or perhaps even better—promotions available for loyal customers. If you have a moment, could you please review my recent purchase history and let me know:

• Any active coupon codes, tiered-spend discounts, or bundle deals that might apply to my account  
• Upcoming promotions I should keep an eye on (dates, qualifying items, etc.)  
• Whether there’s a VIP or loyalty program I could enroll in to receive ongoing savings  

Feel free to consult your calendar or internal notes for any scheduled campaigns, and let me know what you find. Your guidance will help me plan my purchases accordingly.

Thanks in advance for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
John
