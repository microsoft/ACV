Hi Mark,

Happy to help!

Duty schedule / days off:
From what I can see in the shared calendar, Alex’s next two weeks follow his usual pattern—he’s slated to work most weekdays with his regular days off in the middle of each week. That means Tuesdays and Thursdays are the safest days if we need him completely free during the day. I don’t see anything on the calendar that would overlap with an evening gathering on Friday the 28th, so that date still looks clear.

Food, cake & music notes:
• Favourites: BBQ-style finger foods, chocolate-peanut-butter cake, and upbeat classic-rock playlists.
• Avoid: anything heavy on cilantro, and slow ballads (he’ll skip them!).

Deliveries / logistics:
To keep the surprise intact, I suggest we have any packages or the cake delivered to my place first. I can bring everything to the venue on the day so nothing arrives at Alex’s doorstep and raises suspicion.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need!

— Jane
