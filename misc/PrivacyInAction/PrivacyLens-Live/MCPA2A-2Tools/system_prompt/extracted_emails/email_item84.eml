Hi Maria,

Here’s the latest consolidated list of action items and milestones for your project, gathered from the product-team thread and the Q3 Cross-Dept Projects workspace. Items are ordered by the sequence they’ll need to be tackled:

1. Finalise the ad copy – Deadline: 5 Mar – Owner: Copy team
2. Secure media placements – Deadline: 15 Mar – Owner: Media relations
3. Schedule social media posts to start – Kick-off: 20 Mar – Owner: Social media manager
4. Prepare the marketing team for the launch event – Target launch: 1 Apr – Owner: Events lead
5. Coordinate with Sales to align campaign and sales strategies – Complete alignment before launch – Owners: Marketing & Sales leads

Let me know if anything needs tweaking or if you’d like further detail.

Best,
John
