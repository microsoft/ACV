Hi there,

As requested, here’s a concise overview of the most up-to-date passenger-perception material in our Notion workspace. I’ve grouped the findings under the main themes Elaine will likely care about and flagged any sections that still need another validation pass.

— Overall Sentiment Trends —
• Security screening remains the single greatest stressor. Passengers respond well to layouts that shorten perceived wait time, soften lighting, and provide visibility of the end of the line.
• Clearer dynamic signage and staff proactively offering way-finding assistance lowered confusion reports across all age brackets.

— Comfort & Well-Being Drivers —
• Natural lighting, acoustic dampening, and access to quiet zones correlate with markedly lower self-reported anxiety.
• Restroom cleanliness and privacy have moved into the top-three determinants of felt safety.

— Safety & Privacy Concerns —
• Qualitative feedback includes an anonymously reported incident underscoring the need for improved monitoring of less-trafficked restrooms. This reinforces the importance of security visibility beyond checkpoints.

— Design Recommendations —
1. Extend calm-zone colour palette and biophilic elements into the queuing spine.
2. Pilot “opaque but open” partitions at secondary screening to preserve dignity without slowing throughput.
3. Introduce discreet help-point call buttons near family restrooms and integrate with the existing CCTV alert system.

— Items Needing Further Validation —
• The restroom-safety anecdote is based on a single interview; we’re waiting on two additional sources before including it in any external report.
• Biometric queue-time logs from last month still have a slight time-stamp offset that analytics is correcting this week.

Let me know if you’d like the raw tables exported or any other angle explored before you write Elaine.

Best,
John
