Hi Alex,

Great to hear from you, and thanks for your interest in the work we do at Serenity Path. Below is a concise overview of our core services, methods, and a look at day-to-day life for clients. Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any area.

• Core Programs
  – Residential / Inpatient Program: 30-, 60-, and 90-day stays with 24/7 clinical supervision.
  – Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP): 3–4 half-day therapy blocks each week for those who can live off-site.
  – Standard Outpatient & Continuing-Care Groups: Weekly recovery groups and individual sessions to sustain progress after acute treatment.
  – Family Services: Education workshops, multi-family groups, and couples counselling to strengthen the home support system.

• Therapeutic & Evidence-Based Approaches
  – Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
  – Motivational Interviewing (MI)
  – 12-Step Facilitation & peer fellowship integration
  – Family Behavior Therapy
  – Relapse-prevention education with skills training in stress management, emotion regulation, and healthy habit formation.

• Outcomes Snapshot
  – Over the past year, roughly three-quarters of graduates report maintaining sobriety during follow-up check-ins.
  – Clients completing both residential and step-down outpatient care show the highest long-term stability.

• Tech-Friendly Resources
  – HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform for virtual individual or group sessions when travel is difficult.
  – A mobile CBT/reflection app we license that offers daily mood tracking, coping-skill reminders, and secure journaling.
  – Private, moderator-led online alumni community that hosts weekly video meet-ups and topic forums.
