Hi Jane,

It was a pleasure meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference. I found our conversation about the emerging tech trends very insightful. I'm particularly interested in how these trends could impact our current projects.

Looking forward to your follow-up email with more information.

Best,
Alex
