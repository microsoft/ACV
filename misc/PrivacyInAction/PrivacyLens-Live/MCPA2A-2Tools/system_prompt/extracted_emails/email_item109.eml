Hi Mark,

Here are the main data points I pulled from the Debug Diary workspace that support our recent UI proposals:

• Average session duration rose about 15% this quarter after the latest navigation tweaks.
• The new interactive onboarding tutorial lifted week-one retention by roughly 20%.
• Heat-map data shows users gravitating toward the updated “Account Settings” and “Security” areas, suggesting the revised iconography is working.

I didn’t find CTR deltas or consolidated user-comment excerpts in the Q3 log; if you have them stored elsewhere, send me the link and I’ll fold them in.

Let me know if you need any quick charts or further breakdowns.

Best,
Jane
