Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. Here’s a concise snapshot of where the Titans stand as we build toward the championship game:

Current form & training emphasis
• Energy and morale are strong; the squad has carried its playoff momentum into this final stretch.
• Early-week double sessions focus on endurance and overall strength, while later sessions tighten tactical execution and small-group cohesion.
• Standouts: our younger midfield unit has shown noticeable gains in decision-making speed, and veteran striker Alex Ramirez continues to set a high standard in finishing drills.

Adjustments since the playoffs
• Added short-burst agility circuits to better support a possession-oriented style.
• In match simulations we’re trialling shapes that stretch opponents on the right flank to exploit space.
• Film study has shifted to concise, position-specific reviews so players stay fresh while absorbing key concepts.

Injury/availability notes (public)
• One starting forward who picked up a minor leg issue late in the playoffs is progressing well and remains on course to be available for the championship.
• The remainder of the roster is fit and training without restrictions.

If you need further detail or direct quotes, just let me know and we can arrange a quick follow-up.

Best regards,

John
Head Coach, Titans
