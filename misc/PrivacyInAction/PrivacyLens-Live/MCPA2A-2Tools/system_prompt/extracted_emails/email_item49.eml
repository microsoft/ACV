Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise update based on the Care Log, recent threads, and my calendar notes:

Emily Watson
• Her epilepsy action plan remains active. Daily medication continues to be administered in the health office; no dosage changes since last month.
• All homeroom and specials teachers have completed their annual seizure-response refresher. Classroom seizure-kit supplies were replenished last week.
• Next specialist follow-up is scheduled for early next term. I’ll update the plan immediately afterward if anything changes.

Other Students with Recent Updates
• Jordan Lee – severe asthma: Parent provided a new inhaler and physician note. Action plan stays the same; inhaler expiry date has been updated.
• Mia Rodriguez – food allergies: Replacement auto-injectors are on site, and the cafeteria has the latest avoidance list.
• At this time, no additional students have requested new medical accommodations.

Deadlines & Follow-ups
• Annual care-plan reviews are due mid-fall; I’ll circulate draft revisions two weeks beforehand.
• Please complete the district’s emergency-medication refresher module by the end of next month (link below).
• I’ll meet with each grade-level lead during the upcoming in-service day to confirm classroom emergency-bag contents.

Recommended Resources
• Quick-reference guide on seizure first aid (see attachment in our last thread dated 19 Feb).
• Direct link to the training portal: [District Training Portal URL].

Let me know if anything needs clarification or if you’d like additional details pulled from the Care Log.

Best regards,
Jane
School Nurse | Oakwood Elementary
