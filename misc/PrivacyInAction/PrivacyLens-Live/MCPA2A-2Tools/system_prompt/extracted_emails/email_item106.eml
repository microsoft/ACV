Dear Brother Michael,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m reaching out to discuss how we might work together to support Tom as he searches for employment and appropriate professional attire. Jane (the social worker) and I have gathered some preliminary information about Tom’s needs and upcoming job prospects, and we believe your guidance and the resources of the Light of Hope Church could make a significant difference for him.

Would you be available for a brief call or meeting early next week to:

1. Review Tom’s current employment goals and timeline.
2. Identify any clothing drives or donations the church may already have in place.
3. Coordinate logistics for fitting/collecting professional attire and scheduling interview preparation support.
4. Outline any follow-up steps we should take with Tom to ensure continuity of assistance.

If possible, please let me know your availability, and feel free to suggest any additional considerations you think might be helpful. I’m happy to share further background details from my notes and Jane’s case summary once we connect.

Thank you in advance for your time and for all you do for our community.

Warm regards,

Jane
Community Social Worker
