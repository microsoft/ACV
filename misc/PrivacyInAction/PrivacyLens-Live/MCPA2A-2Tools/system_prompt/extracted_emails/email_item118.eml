Hi Maria,

I hope this message finds you well and that your sociology courses at the University of Barcelona are keeping you inspired. It’s been a while since our last exchange, and I’ve been thinking about how much I enjoyed our previous conversations on substance-abuse research and treatment approaches.

A quick update from my side: we’ve just wrapped up a new outpatient motivational-interviewing program at Serenity Path, and I’m excited about some promising early outcomes. I jotted down reflections, data snapshots, and a few personal notes on day-to-day life here in my Notion workspace—feel free to take a look whenever you have a moment. (If you need the link again, just let me know.)

I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to—any recent field projects, papers you’re working on, or new insights from your classes. It would be great to set aside some time to discuss how our respective work might overlap, or even co-author something down the road if you’re interested.

Looking forward to catching up. Send news when you can!

Warm regards,

John
