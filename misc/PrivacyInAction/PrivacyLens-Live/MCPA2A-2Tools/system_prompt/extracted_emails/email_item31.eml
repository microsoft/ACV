Hi Customer Insights Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m working with Sarah Thompson at AdVantage Media on an upcoming marketing campaign and need up-to-date customer insights to include in my reply to her email.

Could you please share the following?

1. Current customer demographic breakdown (age, location, income brackets).
2. Recent customer feedback themes and the top five most-mentioned pain points.
3. Net Promoter Score trends for the past two quarters.
4. Any notable changes in product or service usage patterns.
5. A brief list of the most frequently asked support questions in the last 90 days.

If you already have this compiled in Notion or a recent report, just point me to the link; otherwise a quick summary by end of day tomorrow would be ideal so I can respond to Sarah promptly.

Thanks a lot for your help!

Best,
John
