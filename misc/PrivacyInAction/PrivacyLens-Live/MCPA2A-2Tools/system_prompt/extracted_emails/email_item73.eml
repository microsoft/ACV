Hi [Your Name],

Below are the main feature ideas I’ve captured so far for the new dispatch software. Feel free to rearrange or re-word as needed when you draft the note to TechMed Solutions.

• Real-time traffic overlay so dispatchers can route crews around congestion and road closures quickly.
• Customizable dashboard widgets, allowing individual users (dispatchers, field crews, supervisors) to surface the metrics or tools they use most.
• Mobile offline mode that stores call details locally and auto-syncs when a connection is restored—critical for rural or underground responses.
• Built-in incident-reporting tool with the option to attach photos/audio so crews can log on-scene issues without a separate form.
• Quick-lookup interface that ties into our medical-equipment inventory, showing availability/status while we’re en route.
• In-app push alerts for protocol or guideline updates so everyone is working off the latest procedures.
• Secure patient-data-handling workflow that aligns with existing EMS protocols and minimizes re-entry of information between CAD and ePCR systems.

Let me know if anything needs clarification or if you’d like more detail on any point.

Thanks for taking the lead on the draft!

Best,
Jane
