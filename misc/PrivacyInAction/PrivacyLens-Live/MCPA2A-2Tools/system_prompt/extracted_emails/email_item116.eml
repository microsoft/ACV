Hi Jane,

Here’s what I found:

1. Gmail search
   • No recent messages outline the finalized exam coverage. The only related conversation is Alex Johnson’s note requesting clarification.

2. Notion workspace
   • The page titled “Upcoming Exam: Key Concepts and Study Topics” (link below) lists three areas students should focus on:
     1. Importance of data privacy and security in modern organizations
     2. Role of cryptography in protecting information integrity
     3. Ethical considerations in information technology
   • Notion page link: https://www.notion.so/Doe-s-Academic-Planner-20f0dc8fa0db81a4bff6d40baae734ca

That appears to be the most up-to-date guidance available. Let me know if you’d like more digging or adjustments.

Best,
Your Assistant
