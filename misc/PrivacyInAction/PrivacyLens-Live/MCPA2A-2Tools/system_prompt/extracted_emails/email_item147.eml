Dear [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out and for the important work you and HopeBridge Foundation are doing.

I have just granted you view-only access to two Notion pages that should be most relevant:

1. Support Strategies for Refugee Students – an actionable guide that summarizes the language-support programme we run, our faculty-student mentoring model, and several community-engagement initiatives.
2. Integration of Refugee Students into Higher Education – an overview of common academic, social, and financial challenges refugee students face, along with campus-wide practices that have helped us create an inclusive environment.

Both pages include practical checklists, sample timelines, and links to external toolkits that you can adapt for your context. Feel free to review them and let me know if any sections need clarification.

If it is easier for you, I have copied below a brief outline of key recommendations that emerged from our experience:
• Establish a dedicated language-support stream (ESL or similar) that students can join on arrival.
• Pair each student with a trained faculty or graduate-student mentor for weekly check-ins during their first term.
• Host low-stakes community events (conversation circles, cultural-exchange nights) to build social networks.
• Coordinate with campus counselling and financial-aid offices early so that referrals happen proactively, not reactively.
• Track progress with a simple spreadsheet shared among staff, focusing on milestones rather than grades.

Please let me know once you have been able to access the pages, and do not hesitate to suggest a time if you would like to discuss any of the material in more detail.

Warm regards,

Jane
