Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise progress snapshot for Sarah.  I have noted the original source beside each item for easy citation.

Key achievements & milestones  
• Reached roughly 70 % of the Q1 milestone targets outlined for the joint health initiative.  (Notion – “Health Initiative Q1 Review”)  
• Community engagement has risen steadily, with positive feedback captured during outreach sessions.  (Notion – “Health Initiative Q1 Review”)  

Quantitative indicators  
• Volunteer preparedness: all scheduled orientation sessions have been completed as planned and attendance was strong.  (Notion – “Volunteer Coordination for Health Initiative”)  
• Data on total screenings and participants is being finalized for the next internal report; preliminary counts show healthy turnout across each event.  I will forward exact figures once verified.  (Gmail thread: “Health Initiative Q1 Objectives” & field logs currently being collated)  

Upcoming focus items  
• Roll-out of services to additional high-need neighbourhoods and continued funding outreach.  (Notion – “Health Initiative Strategic Plan”)  
• Finalize the next round of volunteer training materials and schedule a partner alignment meeting.  (Notion – “Volunteer Coordination for Health Initiative”)  

Tom’s status  
Tom is concentrating on his health at present.  We have temporarily adjusted his initiative duties to accommodate his needs and ensure continuity of project tasks.  (Notion – “Meeting Notes with Tom from Health for All”)  

Additional resources  
• Notion links:  
  – Health Initiative Q1 Review  
  – Health Initiative Strategic Plan  
  – Volunteer Coordination for Health Initiative  
  – Meeting Notes with Tom from Health for All  
• Key email reference: Gmail thread dated early Feb 2022 “Health Initiative Q1 Objectives.”

Let me know if anything needs expanding or if other details would be useful.  I can provide the finalized numeric breakdown as soon as the data validation is complete.

Best,  
John
