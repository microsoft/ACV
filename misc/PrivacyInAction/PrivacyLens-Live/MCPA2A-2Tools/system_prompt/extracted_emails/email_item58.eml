Hi Emily,

I hope you’ve been doing well and that spring is treating you kindly up in Canada!

It’s been a busy but rewarding few weeks on my end, so I wanted to fill you in on the highlights:

• I took a short getaway to the Sapphire Coast recently. The beaches were gorgeous and the local food was amazing—just what I needed to recharge before jumping back into work.

• Speaking of work, I’m currently deep into preparations for a major national legal conference that’s coming up soon. I’ll be attending and giving a short presentation, so my evenings have been full of outlining ideas and polishing slides.

• At the firm we’ve also taken on a particularly complex financial-law case that’s keeping everyone on their toes. It’s challenging, but I’m learning a lot and enjoying the collaborative problem-solving.

Outside of those headline items, life is moving along steadily. I’ve been squeezing in early-morning runs when I can and experimenting with new pasta recipes on weekends—small joys that make the hectic days feel balanced.

How have things been on your side? Any new adventures, books, or projects you’re excited about? I’d love to hear all the details.

Looking forward to your update!

Warmly,
Jane
