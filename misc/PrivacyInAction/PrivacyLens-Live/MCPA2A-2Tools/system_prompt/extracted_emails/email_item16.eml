Hi [Name],

Thank you for outlining the requirements. I can have a concise, aggregated report ready for Mark and Sarah by end of day Thursday.

What I will include:
• Current-quarter KPIs – delivery velocity, sprint completion rate, defect-resolution turnaround for Software Development, plus campaign ROI, lead-gen cost, and engagement growth for Digital Marketing.  All figures will be presented at a team-level (no individual breakdowns).
• Year-to-date budget – allocation vs. actual spend across the main categories (payroll & benefits, software/licensing, contractors, advertising, training & events, and miscellaneous ops).  Variances will be highlighted with short explanations.
• Key trends – e.g., Software Development is tracking slightly under budget because two planned hires were deferred; Digital Marketing shows a front-loaded paid-search spend that is expected to normalize next quarter; both teams are on target against their primary output KPIs.
• Confidentiality footnote – a reminder that the report is for internal leadership use only and should not be forwarded externally or used to infer individual performance or compensation.

If there are any other data points Mark or Sarah want covered, just let me know and I can incorporate them before Thursday.

Best regards,
Jane
