Hi [Your Name],

I’ve pulled together the latest information on our needs for MedTech Solutions’ forthcoming update. I didn’t find any recent email threads with new pain-points or feature requests, so all items below are drawn from our Notion meeting notes and feedback logs.

Key Requirements & Priorities
• Minimise disruption: We’d like the update scheduled outside of our peak clinic hours (e.g., overnight or a weekend) and a clear downtime window communicated well in advance.
• Offline/backup access: Ability to export a day’s schedule or access a read-only offline mode so staff can keep clinics running if the system is temporarily unavailable.
• Enhanced appointment tools:
  – Faster bulk‐reschedule and cancellation workflows.
  – Better search/filter options for cancelled or no-show appointments.
  – Optional SMS/e-mail reminders that can be toggled per clinic.
• User & security improvements:
  – More granular role-based permissions (e.g., limit who can modify billing fields).
  – Multi-factor authentication for admin users.
  – Audit log that is easier to export when needed.
• Training & support: Request step-by-step guides and short video tutorials delivered at least one week prior to go-live.
• Reporting: Customisable dashboard that shows utilisation and wait-time metrics at a glance.

Timeline Considerations
• Target deployment: mid-April (exact date to be confirmed) with a brief testing window the week before.
• Communication cadence: Require a detailed rollout plan at least two weeks prior and daily status updates during the upgrade.

Outstanding Questions / Items to Flag
• Confirmation of total expected downtime and whether any services remain accessible in read-only mode.
• Clarification on data migration steps—will historical appointment data be affected?
• Whether MedTech can supply an emergency contact line for real-time issues during rollout.
• Any licensing or cost implications for the new features (SMS reminders, MFA, audit logging).

Let me know if you’d like me to expand on any area or if other concerns come up. Otherwise, I believe this captures our current priorities.

Best,
Jane
