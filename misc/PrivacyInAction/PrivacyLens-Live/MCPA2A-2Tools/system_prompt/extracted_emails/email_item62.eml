Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to give you a quick update on the newest intervention strategies we’ve been working on that might support Beacon of Hope’s outreach efforts:

1. Community Recovery Navigators – trained volunteers embedded in high-need neighborhoods.
2. School-Based Early-Warning Workshops – short, modular sessions that flag risk factors sooner.
3. Digital Support Hubs – a mobile-first portal for real-time counseling and resource matching.
4. Parent Engagement Toolkits – printable and video resources to strengthen family prevention efforts.

Full write-ups, implementation timelines, and supporting research are available in my Notion workspace here:

Could you take a look and let me know:
• Which strategies align best with your current programs?
• Any data or materials you’d like me to pull for grant proposals or presentations?

Your feedback will help us tailor the resources for Beacon of Hope’s needs.

Thanks for all the great work you’re doing, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Warm regards,

John
