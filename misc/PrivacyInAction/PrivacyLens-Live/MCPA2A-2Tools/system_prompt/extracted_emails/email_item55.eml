Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out about the SkyHigh Tower questions. To make sure I give you the most accurate feedback, could you please share or point me to the following?

• The latest structural analysis files (models, calculations, or spreadsheets) you referenced.
• Any updated load-combination assumptions you’re using for the transfer girder on Levels 15–18.
• The current crane-load schedule or any related milestones (if it’s already on our shared calendar, just let me know the event name).
• Any background notes or sketches you may have saved in our Notion workspace—feel free to just drop the link.

Once I have those, I can review everything and get a detailed response back to you quickly.

Appreciate your help, and let me know if there’s anything else you need from my side.

Best regards,
Jane
