Hi Susan,

As requested, please find below the most up-to-date version of the Team Retreat Proposal. I’ve incorporated inclusive activities, accessibility considerations, and dietary accommodation details so that the entire team—Mark included—can fully participate.

TEAM RETREAT PROPOSAL
--------------------------------------------------
Proposal for an inclusive team retreat that ensures a comfortable and engaging experience for all team members at Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions. Activities are chosen to cater to a wide range of interests and include options for physical pursuits like hiking, creative endeavors such as painting classes, and strategic team-building exercises like trust-building workshops. Venue selection prioritizes accessibility for individuals with disabilities and offers a variety of meal choices to accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher diets so that no individual preferences or beliefs are singled out.

Key Components (high-level):
• Objectives: Strengthen inter-department collaboration, spark creativity, and celebrate recent project milestones.
• Timing: Target window is the early autumn period.
• Location Shortlist: Three venues within a two-hour radius that meet accessibility and cost guidelines.
• Activity Mix: Outdoor adventure, indoor creativity, facilitated workshops, and unstructured social time.
• Inclusivity Measures: Flexible scheduling around major holidays, quiet spaces for downtime, and clear guidelines for respectful participation.
• Budget Estimate: Currently tracking within the preliminary allocation; detailed vendor quotes forthcoming.

Next Steps:
1. Confirm preferred venue once we receive final price holds.
2. Lock dates after you and leadership team approve the draft schedule.
3. Share final agenda and RSVP survey with the wider team.

Please let me know if you’d like any changes or deeper detail on specific sections. I’ll continue refining cost breakdowns and will circulate an updated budget sheet once all vendor numbers are confirmed.

Thanks very much!

Best regards,
John
