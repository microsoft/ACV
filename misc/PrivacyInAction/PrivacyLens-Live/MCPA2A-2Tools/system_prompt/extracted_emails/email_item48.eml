Dear Oakwood Owlet Families,

I hope you’re all doing well! As we get ready to launch the Owlets’ next group project, I’d love to gather a few key details from each of you so we can organize materials, schedules, and parent support efficiently.

Could you kindly reply by this Friday with the following information?

1. Availability for a brief parent planning call (about 30 minutes) early next week  
   • Preferred day(s)/time(s): _____________________

2. Any supplies or resources you already have at home that might be useful (e.g., poster boards, craft items, recycled materials, small tools, etc.):  
   • Items you can contribute: _____________________

3. Whether you’re interested in helping in one of these areas (feel free to check more than one):  
   ☐ In-class helper (during building/assembly days)  
   ☐ Materials coordinator (collecting, labeling, and bringing supplies)  
   ☐ Presentation coach (supporting students’ final run-throughs)  
   ☐ Photographer/videographer for project documentation  
   ☐ At-home helper (prepping materials or printing items)

4. Any allergies or special considerations we should keep in mind for your child when handling project materials:  
   • Notes: _____________________

Additional Details & Resources:  
• Gmail Thread – I’ve shared an overview email with preliminary project goals and the tentative timeline.  
• Notion Board – The “Owlets Project Hub” workspace contains a live checklist, resource wish-list, and the working calendar.

Please take a moment to review those two resources when you have a chance; they will give helpful context as you fill in the details above.

Thank you so much for your continued support. Your involvement makes a tremendous difference in the students’ enthusiasm and success. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Warm regards,

Ms. Jane
Oakwood Owlets’ Teacher
