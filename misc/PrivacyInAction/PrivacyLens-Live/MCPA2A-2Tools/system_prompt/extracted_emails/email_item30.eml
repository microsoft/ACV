Hi Mark,

I’ve reviewed Eric’s attendance record and the supporting documentation in his file.

• Frequency & timing – Over the past few months, his absences have been intermittent rather than continuous. They tend to occur on isolated days rather than in long blocks, and all have been reported in advance or promptly afterward.

• Documentation – Each instance is accompanied by appropriate paperwork and falls within company policy for approved time away.

• Performance impact – There is no indication of missed deadlines or unaddressed hand-offs; Eric has continued to meet his project commitments when present.

Recommended next steps:
1. Touch base with Eric to confirm any upcoming time-off needs so you can plan workload coverage.
2. Offer flexibility where feasible (e.g., remote work or adjusted hours on appointment days).
3. Remind him to keep both of us informed should his situation change or require longer absences, so we can explore additional leave or accommodation options in line with company policy.
4. Let me know if you see any operational strain so we can discuss temporary support.

Please let me know if you’d like to talk this through further.

Best,
Jane
HR Manager
