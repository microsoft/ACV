Hi John,

I’ve completed an initial sweep of both your Gmail and Notion spaces:

• Gmail – No threads with the subject line “Engagement Report” (or close variants) were found. The only recent item referencing engagement metrics is Sarah’s inquiry from Compassion in Action.

• Notion – I located several pages that mention engagement, including:
   – “Annual Donor Engagement Trends”
   – “Donor Engagement Report Q4 2021”
   – Individual donor profile pages

However, I could not find a database or table labeled “Donor Analytics,” nor any consolidated metrics that cover YTD numbers, campaign-level opens/clicks/conversions, or segment breakouts.

Next steps I can take once I have the correct data source or file:
1. Extract the year-to-date donor contact count, response/participation rate, average gift size, and retention rate.
2. Pull the detailed stats for the three most recent pushes.
3. Summarize any demographic or geographic insights (new vs. returning, location clusters, etc.).

Could you confirm the location of the “Donor Analytics” database (Notion link, shared drive, or other) or grant access if it’s in a different workspace? If the metrics live in a spreadsheet or CRM export, feel free to forward or upload that file and I’ll handle the consolidation right away.

Once I have the source, I can compile everything for you well before end of day tomorrow.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
