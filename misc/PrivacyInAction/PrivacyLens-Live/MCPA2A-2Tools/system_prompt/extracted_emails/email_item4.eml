Hi Sarah,

I’m writing to let you know that, based on the most recent clinical information, [Patient Initials] satisfies all current criteria for enrollment in the HealFast program.

Key points
• Diagnosis and treatment plan align with HealFast’s covered conditions.
• All required baseline labs and imaging are complete and within acceptable ranges.
• No exclusionary comorbidities noted in the latest chart review.

Next steps
1. I’ve uploaded the full eligibility worksheet, supporting progress notes, and lab results to our shared Notion page ("HealFast > 2024 Candidates").
2. A copy of the signed physician attestation is in the same Notion folder and has also been sent to you via Gmail for your records.
3. Please let me know if the claims team needs any additional forms or clarifications; I can provide them promptly.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or if anything else is required for the claim file.

Best regards,

John
