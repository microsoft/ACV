Hi [Colleague’s Name],

As requested, here’s a concise update from the latest items I found:

Gmail correspondence
• No new threads with Emily or the Community United team in the past month that reference donation strategies, campaign performance, or upcoming initiatives.
• The most recent relevant exchange (earlier this year) centered on exploring recurring donations, strengthening donor-recognition tactics, and using social-media challenges to boost engagement. No attachments were included in that thread.

Notion “Community United Partnership” notes
• Current fundraising total logged for the most recent joint campaign: roughly $3,000.
• Trend: donations are showing a modest upward trajectory compared with the previous cycle, driven mainly by participants in our new recurring-giving pilot.
• Strategy-call highlights: (1) Promote recurring giving options, (2) refresh donor-recognition materials, (3) launch a youth-oriented social-media challenge.
• Pending action items: identify a prospective recurring-donor list, draft the updated recognition plan, and outline a content calendar for the social-media challenge.

No slide decks or other attachments surfaced during the search. Let me know if you need anything else!

Best,
John
