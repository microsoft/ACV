Dear [Your Name],

Thank you for collecting feedback for Alex. Below is a concise summary he can find helpful. I have intentionally omitted any numeric or letter grades in accordance with best practices for protecting student records; please feel free to relay the information to Alex or invite him to follow up with me directly for further details.

Key Strengths
• Demonstrates a solid grasp of the course concepts and applies them effectively to his dataset.
• Data analysis is well-executed, and the accompanying visualizations clearly support his main points.
• Presentation of findings is organized and easy to follow.

Areas to Refine
• Sharpen the wording of the hypothesis so the research question stands out immediately.
• Consider tightening the introduction and conclusion to reinforce the overall argument.
• A brief discussion of potential limitations (e.g., sample size, assumptions) would strengthen the final section.

Next Steps / Resources
• I recommend Alex review the “Formulating Concise Research Questions” handout on the course site.
• A tutorial on succinct writing in empirical reports (linked on the same page) could help polish his introduction and conclusion.
• If he would like additional guidance, Alex is welcome to book a short meeting during my office hours.

Please let me know if any other material would be useful for your summary email, or if you need me to clarify rubric categories at a high level.

Best regards,

Jane
