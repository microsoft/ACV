Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for the reminder. Here is a quick status update on the items you listed for Emily Thompson:

• Résumé – uploaded to the VerifyCorp portal this morning (file name: EmilyThompson_Resume.pdf).
• Signed background-check authorization form – uploaded to the portal (file name: EmilyThompson_BGConsent.pdf).
• Offer letter – uploaded as an optional reference document.
• Government-issued photo ID – Emily is providing an updated scan. I expect to have it uploaded by Wednesday and will confirm once it is in the portal.

Please let me know if you have any trouble accessing the files or need anything else. I’ll follow up again as soon as the ID is posted so we stay on track for your June 14 deadline.

Thanks for your support,
