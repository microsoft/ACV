Hi Sarah,

Thanks for sending over the draft schedule and budget—I've gone through both the email and the Notion page.

Schedule
• The flow is clear and has a good balance of work and social time. One thought is to shorten the opening remarks a little and use that time for small-group ice-breakers—this should warm everyone up before the first workshop.
• The afternoon collaborative session could be framed as a light “hackathon” focused on cross-team problem solving. That ties in well with recent feedback about wanting more creative spaces.
• Consider building in a brief buffer (10-15 minutes) between each main block so sessions don’t spill over and cut into breaks.
• An optional guided outdoor activity on the second morning might help re-energize the group before we move back into discussion blocks.

Budget
• Lodging remains the biggest line item. If we haven’t already, it may be worth asking the venue about a group-rate adjustment—especially if we can confirm numbers this week.
• Food & beverage looks reasonable. Let’s run a quick dietary-needs survey early next week so we don’t over-allocate on extras.
• Transportation is currently listed at the exact quoted cost. I’d add a small contingency (around 5%) to cover last-minute transfers.
• We could trim a bit from branded giveaways and reallocate to the contingency fund or the workshop materials; most teams value the activity takeaways more than extra swag.

Next Steps
If these tweaks align with your thinking I’m happy to update the working files, or we can review live during our touch-base. Either way, the structure is strong—just a few refinements and we’ll be in great shape.

Let me know what works best for you.

Best,
John
