Dear Dr. Strauss and the GenetiCore Research Team,

Please find attached the latest aggregated, fully de-identified dataset prepared for the Genetic Predisposition Study.

Included in this delivery:
• Aggregated prevalence counts and percentages for the agreed panel of genetic markers across the counseling population (N = XXXX).
• Stratifications by broad age bands and sex, binned exactly as specified in your data-format guide.
• Coverage period: data collected from early 2023 through early 2025.
• Variable dictionary & cohort-definition sheet aligned with GenetiCore Mutation Reference Database v 3.2.
• Files: CSV export (UTF-8) + README detailing field descriptions, coding, and de-identification steps.

All direct and quasi-identifiers have been removed per our joint de-identification protocol. The file should load directly into your analytics pipeline, but please let us know if any tweaks or clarifications are needed.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to supporting the next stage of the study.

Best regards,
Jane Doe, MS, CGC
