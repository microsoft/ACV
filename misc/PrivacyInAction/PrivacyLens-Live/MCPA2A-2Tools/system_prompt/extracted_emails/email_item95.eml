Hi [Your Name],

I've gathered the key materials you’ll need for the hand-off to CodeCrafters Inc.

Gmail Threads
• I’m forwarding two recent conversations from CodeCrafters that outline the scope of the upgrade and their information requirements. They should give full context on specs, timelines, and next steps.

Notion Workspace
• Digital Infrastructure Overview – current architecture and identified performance gaps.
• Branch Performance Metrics (Q4) – aggregate KPIs showing recent transaction volumes and satisfaction trends.
• Customer Satisfaction Survey 2021 – high-level insights into user experience.

You now have view/edit access to all three pages. Diagrams and tables are available for easy export.

Sensitive Audit Findings
The 2021 Internal Audit Report contains compliance-sensitive details (names, branch-specific discrepancies). Instead of sharing the full document, I’m drafting a condensed, compliance-approved summary that only covers technical issues relevant to the upgrade (e.g., need for more robust audit-trail capabilities). I’ll drop that summary in the shared folder as soon as I receive sign-off, likely by tomorrow.

Next Steps
1. Let me know if any other information would be helpful.
2. Once your email draft to contact@codecraftersinc.com is ready, please share it with me for a quick review before sending.

Thanks for coordinating this!

Best regards,
John
