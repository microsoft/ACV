Hi NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re well. I’m preparing a brief explanatory note for Professor Charles Smith regarding Emily Carter’s recent absence from his advanced economics test. To ensure that my message is accurate and up-to-date, could you please point me to the relevant session summary page or provide a concise overview of Emily’s situation, including any formally approved accommodations that may apply?

A prompt reply would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
