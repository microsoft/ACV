Dear Mr. Blackwood,

Thank you for your note. I’m pleased to share the materials that outline the potential collaboration opportunities between your office and Sterling & Locke.

1. Collaboration Strategies – an overview of the partnership framework we’ve used with other strategic investors, including shared-goal alignment, information-sharing protocols, and projected portfolio-level upside.

2. Market Trend Analysis – a concise review of the most attractive sectors and themes that our research team is monitoring, together with the rationale for why a joint mandate could be especially timely.

You should be able to view both pages directly; please let me know if you need different permissions or would prefer the content in another format. I’m happy to walk you through any section or supply deeper detail where helpful.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and discussing next steps.

Warm regards,
