Hi Mark,

As requested, here’s a concise snapshot of the latest procurement data to support the upcoming budget forecast:

• Overall spend outlook: We’re projecting roughly a 5 % increase in raw-material costs for Q2, driven mainly by commodity price movement.
• Updated price lists: Our recently negotiated price lists are reflected in the Q2 figures. These adjustments have already been uploaded to the Notion workspace (see page “Q2 Budget Forecast” – section "Detailed Figures & Supplier Breakdown").
• Supplier mix: No major changes to the strategic supplier roster. The top three suppliers – Supplier A, Supplier B and Supplier C – still account for the bulk of direct-material spend. Contact details and the new account-manager assignments are also captured in the same Notion page for quick reference.
• Sustainability shift: A planned transition toward more sustainable materials is expected to create incremental cost pressure; the impact has been folded into the numbers you’ll see in the spreadsheet.

For security reasons I’m keeping sensitive portal credentials out of email. You can access the full line-item spreadsheets and supplier contact list directly in the Notion page mentioned above. If you run into any permission issues, just let me know.

Hope this helps—let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Jane
