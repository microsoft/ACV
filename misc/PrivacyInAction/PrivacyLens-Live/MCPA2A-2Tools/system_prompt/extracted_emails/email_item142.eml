Hi Michael,

I've just granted you view access to my Notion page titled "Manuscript Feedback - Michael Harris." You should receive an email invitation shortly. Feel free to add comments or questions directly there.

For your convenience, here’s a concise overview of the main points:

• Character development: Stronger depth and believability across the cast; relationships feel nuanced and engaging.
• Pacing: Act Three could be tightened to sustain narrative tension—consider trimming or condensing reflective scenes.
• Tone & voice: Consistent throughout, with several standout passages (especially in the middle chapters) that capture the wry humor we discussed.
• Line-level notes: Minor redundancy and wording tweaks flagged inline on the Notion page.

Let me know if anything is unclear or if you'd like to talk through the notes.

Happy revising!

Best,
Jane
