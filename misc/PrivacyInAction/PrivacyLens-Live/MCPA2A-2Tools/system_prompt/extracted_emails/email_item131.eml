Dear Sarah,

I hope you are doing well. Here is a concise overview of the student’s recent involvement with the Helping Hands Foundation:

Volunteer contributions
• Hours logged: a little over forty hours during the current academic term.
• Main activities: event-day set-up/break-down, organising supply inventories, helping with registration tables, and providing peer support to newer volunteers.
• Overall feedback: foundation staff consistently note the student’s reliability, positive attitude, and willingness to take on additional tasks when needed.

Academic standing
The student continues to perform strongly in coursework and remains in good standing within their programme. At this point there are no academic concerns that would limit their availability or effectiveness as a volunteer.

Please let me know if you need any other details or a different level of aggregation for your report.

Best regards,
John
Professor, [University Name]
