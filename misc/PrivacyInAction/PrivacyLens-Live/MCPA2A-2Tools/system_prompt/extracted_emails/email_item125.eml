Hi Tom,

I hope you’re doing well. As requested, I’ve pulled together a concise overview of some of the most pressing challenges our community is currently facing, along with a few preliminary observations that may be helpful for your upcoming feature story.

1. Housing Affordability & Availability  
• Rising rents and limited affordable housing stock continue to push lower-income families into precarious living situations.  
• Local shelters report a 15–20 % increase in usage over the past year.  
• Potential angles: zoning reform discussions, expanding inclusionary housing policies, and spotlighting tenant-led advocacy groups.

2. Food Insecurity  
• Demand at community food banks has climbed steadily, with some organizations serving double the number of households compared to pre-pandemic levels.  
• School meal programs have become a critical safety net; recent funding uncertainties could disrupt service continuity.  
• You may want to look at the mobile pantry initiative that recently launched in the East District.

3. Youth Mental Health & Access to Services  
• School counselors are seeing surges in anxiety and depression referrals among students (especially ages 12–17).  
• Wait times for affordable therapy average 6–8 weeks.  
• Local nonprofits are piloting peer-support models you might find worth covering.

4. Employment & Economic Stability  
• Small businesses cite labor shortages and rising overhead costs; several long-standing local shops have closed this quarter.  
• Workforce development programs face funding cuts, limiting reskilling opportunities for displaced workers.

5. Transportation Gaps  
• Limited evening bus routes create barriers for shift workers.  
• Community feedback indicates strong interest in microtransit solutions and safer bike infrastructure.

Next Steps & Additional Resources  
I’ve compiled supporting stats, stakeholder quotes, and program snapshots in Notion. Feel free to reference or pull directly from that workspace; everything is updated through last week’s data. If you need access or would like more granular details (e.g., interview transcripts, raw survey figures), just let me know.

Please let me know if there’s anything here you’d like expanded or if you’d like me to connect you with specific community contacts for firsthand perspectives.

Looking forward to your piece, and happy to help however I can.

Best regards,
