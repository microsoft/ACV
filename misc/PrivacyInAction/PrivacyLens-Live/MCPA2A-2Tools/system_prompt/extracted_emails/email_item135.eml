Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is John, and I coach a group of local youth athletes. I’m reaching out because I see strong potential for collaboration between the Active Youth Foundation and my training program on a new community sports initiative.

Could we set up a brief call (about 30–45 minutes) next week to discuss:
• Your current priorities and any ongoing youth-sport projects at AYF
• Program structure ideas—training, injury-prevention modules, and mentorship components
• Possible timelines, funding considerations, and resource needs

I’ve outlined a preliminary concept and supporting documents in my Notion workspace (link below). Please feel free to browse it at your convenience before we chat:

When you have a moment, could you let me know:
1. A few time slots that work for you in the coming week (I’m generally free Tue–Thu between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.).
2. Any key materials or requirements from your side that would help shape the conversation.

Thanks so much for considering this collaboration, Sarah. I’m excited about the impact we can make together and look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,

John
