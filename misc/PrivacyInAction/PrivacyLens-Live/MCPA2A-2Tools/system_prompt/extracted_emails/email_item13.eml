Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As we discussed, here’s a concise list of stress-management and general wellness ideas you can experiment with over the next couple of weeks. Feel free to keep the ones that resonate and adjust them as needed:

• 5-Minute Mindful Pause – choose one point in the day to sit quietly, notice your breathing, and gently bring your attention back when it wanders.
• Deep Breathing Set – inhale slowly through the nose for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for six; repeat for five cycles.
• Progressive Muscle Relaxation – while seated or lying down, tense a muscle group for five seconds then release for ten, moving from toes to head.
• Mini-Movement Breaks – every hour, stand up, stretch, or walk for a couple of minutes to reset your body.
• Physical Activity – aim for about 20–30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days; choose something you enjoy (brisk walk, bike ride, etc.).
• Sleep Routine – create a wind-down ritual at roughly the same time each evening and keep screens out of the bedroom.
• Nourishing Nutrition – keep a refillable water bottle nearby and include colorful produce at each meal.
• Boundary Check-In – set a reasonable cut-off time for work tasks so you have protected personal time.
• Gratitude Note – jot down one thing you’re thankful for each evening to reinforce a positive focus.
• Scheduled Fun – block out at least one short activity each week that you purely enjoy.

Let me know which of these feel most doable and if anything needs tweaking. We can revisit your experience with them in our next appointment.

Take care,
Jane
