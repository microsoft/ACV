Hi Alex,

As requested, I’ve gathered the key IT materials for our cross-departmental initiative:

• Cybersecurity Protocol Overview – covers MFA, routine system audits, encryption standards, and our streamlined incident-response workflow.  
• Marketing-Platform Integration Checklist – API authentication requirements, approved data-flow paths, and logging/monitoring expectations.  
• User-Access Provisioning Guide – step-by-step for role-based account creation and permission reviews.  
• Reference Links – shared drive folder with the latest templates, code snippets, and configuration examples.

Everything is organized in the shared folder here: [internal link]. If you have any trouble accessing it or need further details, just let me know.

CC’ing our project lead so we all stay aligned.

Best regards,
Jane
Triton Defense Solutions | IT Administration
