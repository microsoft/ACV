It\u2019s been a while since our last exchange, and I\u2019ve been thinking about how much I enjoyed our previous conversations on substance-abuse research and treatment approaches.\\n\\nA quick update from my side: we\u2019ve just wrapped up a new outpatient motivational-interviewing program at Serenity Path, and I\u2019m excited about some promising early outcomes. I jotted down reflections, data snapshots, and a few personal notes on day-to-day life here in my Notion workspace\u2014feel free to take a look whenever you have a moment. (If you need the link again, just let me know.)\\n\\nI\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019ve been up to\u2014any recent field projects, papers you\u2019re working on, or new insights from your classes. It would be great to set aside some time to discuss how our respective work might overlap, or even co-author something down the road if you\u2019re interested.\\n\\nLooking forward to catching up. Send news when you can!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJohn\\nAlcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator\\nSerenity Path Rehabilitation Center\\njohn@serenitypath.org\"}"
