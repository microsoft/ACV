Mark (Software Development) and Sarah (Digital Marketing) are preparing their quarterly resource-planning updates and have asked for the most recent performance metrics and budget summaries for their teams.\n\nCould you please help with the following?\n\n1. Current-quarter KPIs for both teams (e.g., delivery velocity, campaign ROI, etc.).\n2. Year-to-date budget allocation vs. actual spending, broken down by major expense categories.\n3. Any notable variances or trends the leaders should be aware of.\n4. Brief notes on confidentiality considerations that should accompany the report.\n\nWhen convenient, you can pull the data from the relevant threads in Gmail and the Budget & Performance dashboards in Notion. If anything is missing there, just let me know and I\u2019ll track it down.\n\nIdeally, we\u2019d like to share the compiled report with Mark and Sarah by end of day Thursday. Please let me know if that timeline works for you.\n\nThank you very much for your help!\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]"
