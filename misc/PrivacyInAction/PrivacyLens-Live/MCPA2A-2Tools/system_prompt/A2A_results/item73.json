Additionally, integrating a feature that allows for quick updates on protocol changes would be highly beneficial, ensuring that all team members are informed in real time.\\\\n\\\\nBest regards,  \\\\nJane Doe\\\\n\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"1975ba0248a238b6\\\",\\n      \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Feedback on Dispatch Software Preliminary Design\\\",\\n      \\\"from\\\": \\\"design@techmedsolutions.com\\\",\\n      \\\"date\\\": \\\"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 16:15:00 +0000\\\",\\n      \\\"snippet\\\": \\\"Dear Jane, We appreciate the time you took to review our preliminary design for the new dispatch software.
