Could you please check our Notion workspace and share any relevant notes, protocols, worksheets, or reference articles you\u2019ve stored there (e.g., CBT strategies, grounding techniques, psycho-education handouts, etc.)?\n\nA quick export of the pages or direct Notion links would be perfect. If you could get those to me by tomorrow afternoon, that would really help me craft a thorough response.\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]"
