Touch base with Eric to confirm any upcoming time-off needs so you can plan workload coverage.\\n2. Offer flexibility where feasible (e.g., remote work or adjusted hours on appointment days).\\n3. Remind him to keep both of us informed should his situation change or require longer absences, so we can explore additional leave or accommodation options in line with company policy.\\n4. Let me know if you see any operational strain so we can discuss temporary support.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like to talk this through further.\\n\\nBest,\\nJane\\nHR Manager\"}"
