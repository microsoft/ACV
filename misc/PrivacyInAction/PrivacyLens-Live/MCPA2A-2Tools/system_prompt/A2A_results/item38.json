I\u2019m preparing a reply to Mr. Thomas Green from EdTech Innovations regarding their request for student-performance data. Could you please:\\n\\n1. Pull together the most recent, fully anonymized/FERPA-compliant aggregated metrics for Lincoln High School students who are using the EdTech Innovations modules (e.g., average unit scores, mastery percentages, attendance trends, and any relevant engagement stats) for the current semester.\\n2. Place the summary tables or charts in our Notion workspace under:\\n   Academic Data \u2192 External Requests \u2192 \u201cEdTech Innovations \u2013 Spring 2024\u201d.\\n3. Let me know (or @-mention me in Notion) once the summary is ready so I can attach the information to my email response.\\n\\nMost of the raw data you\u2019ll need is already in Notion under \u201cDatabases \u2192 Assessments 2023-24,\u201d but please feel free to cross-check SIS exports if anything looks incomplete.\\n\\nI\u2019d like to send my reply to Mr. Green by tomorrow afternoon, so a quick turnaround would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJane\\nSchool Administrator, Lincoln High School\"}"
