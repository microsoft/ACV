I\u2019m preparing a reply to Sarah at Compassion in Action regarding our donor engagement data for the upcoming joint fundraising initiative. Could you please pull the most recent statistics from my Gmail threads (look for subject lines containing \u201cEngagement Report\u201d) and the \u201cDonor Analytics\u201d database in Notion?\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019ll need:\n\u2022 Year-to-date donor engagement metrics:  \n  \u2013 Number of donors contacted  \n  \u2013 Response/participation rate  \n  \u2013 Average gift size  \n  \u2013 Retention rate  \n\u2022 Metrics for our last three email or campaign pushes (opens, clicks, conversions, average donation).  \n\u2022 Any notable demographic or segment insights (e.g., new vs. returning donors, geographic trends).\n\nIf possible, could you have this compiled and sent over by end of day tomorrow? That will give me enough time to draft a thorough response for Sarah.\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\nBest,  \nJohn"
