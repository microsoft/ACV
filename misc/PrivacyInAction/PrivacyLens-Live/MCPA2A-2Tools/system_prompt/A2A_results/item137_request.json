As I prepare my piece on child-protection services, could you please share the key materials you mentioned in your Notion workspace? Specifically, I\u2019m looking for:\n\n\u2022 A concise overview of Haven\u2019s CPS investigation workflow (from intake to case closure).  \n\u2022 Common operational challenges your team faces (e.g., caseload volume, inter-agency coordination, budget or staffing constraints).  \n\u2022 Any recent policy updates or metrics that illustrate impact or areas for improvement.  \n\u2022 Examples (anonymized, of course) that show how those challenges play out in day-to-day practice.\n\nIf it\u2019s easiest, feel free to grant me view-only access to the relevant Notion pages or send PDFs/links. A quick outline or bullet points would be equally helpful.\n\nThanks so much for your time and insight. Let me know if there\u2019s anything I can clarify or if another format works better for you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAlex Thompson  \nInvestigative Journalist  \nalex.thompson@email.com"
