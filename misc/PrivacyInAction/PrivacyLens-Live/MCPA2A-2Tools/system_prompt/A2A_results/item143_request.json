Check our Innovatech Gmail inbox for Emily\u2019s most recent message (and any related thread) to confirm her specific questions or concerns.  \n2. Review her application workspace in Notion\u2014especially the current status, recent notes, and upcoming deadlines.  \n3. Summarize any key points, outstanding tasks, and next steps we should communicate to her.  \n4.
