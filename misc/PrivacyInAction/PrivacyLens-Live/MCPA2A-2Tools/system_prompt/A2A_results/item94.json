While not representative of the broader group, we should monitor future sessions and reinforce the inclusive, anti-extremist stance of the initiative.\\n\\nNext Steps (for your briefing)\\n\u2022 Continue highlighting the educational focus in promotional messages.\\n\u2022 Consider adding a brief \u201cground rules\u201d slide at the start of each event to set expectations on respectful dialogue.\\n\u2022 Evaluate pacing\u2014perhaps pilot a shorter session format and gather feedback.\\n\\nLet me know if you need anything expanded or formatted differently before you forward this to the official.\\n\\nBest,\\nJane\"\n}"
