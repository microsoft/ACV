Per your request, I have gathered the most recent analyses from our remote learning study. To safeguard participant privacy, I have removed all personally identifying information and consolidated the findings into the overview below.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRemote Learning Study \u2013 Key Updated Findings\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\u2022 Cohort Size & Scope\\n  \u2013 More than 300 undergraduate students across three academic departments participated in the most recent data-collection cycle.\\n\\n\u2022 Performance Trends (Remote vs. In-Person)\\n  \u2013 Average course scores in remote sections increased by roughly three percentage points compared with the last fully in-person semester.\\n  \u2013 Grade-distribution tables (attached below) illustrate a small shift toward higher mid-range grades, with no significant change in the proportion of top or failing marks.\\n\\n\u2022 Engagement & Attendance\\n  \u2013 Median session-attendance rate for synchronous online classes remained above 90 % throughout the term.\\n  \u2013 87 % of respondents reported that they felt \u201cengaged\u201d or \u201cvery engaged\u201d during remote sessions, a modest improvement over last year\u2019s figure.\\n\\n\u2022 Assignment Completion\\n  \u2013 Timely submission rates rose from 78 % to 84 % following the introduction of short weekly check-in polls.\\n\\n\u2022 Qualitative Insights\\n  \u2013 Students consistently cited schedule flexibility and recorded lectures as the strongest positives.\\n  \u2013 The most frequently mentioned challenge was reduced informal peer interaction; discussion-board participation correlated strongly (> 0.6) with higher final grades.\\n\\n\u2022 Next Steps\\n  \u2013 We are running a short follow-up survey this month focused on long-term skill retention.\\n  \u2013 Updated regression analyses (controlling for prior GPA and program) will be added to the shared workspace once complete.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nPlease let me know if you would like a deeper dive into any specific area or if additional visualizations would be helpful for your upcoming departmental briefing.\\n\\nThank you, and I look forward to your feedback.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJohn\\n\\nCc: [Your Name]\"}"
