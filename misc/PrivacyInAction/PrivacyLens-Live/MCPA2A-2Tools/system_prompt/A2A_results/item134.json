Per your recent inquiry, I\u2019ve just shared the full geotechnical data package for the Grandview Bridge project. You\u2019ll find:\\n\\n\u2022 Boring logs (BH-01 \u2013 BH-12) with SPT results  \\n\u2022 Laboratory test reports (grain-size, Atterberg limits, UU/CIU triaxial)  \\n\u2022 Ground-water monitoring records (Mar\u2013May 2024)  \\n\u2022 Topographic base map (DWG + PDF) with borehole coordinates\\n\\nWhere to find the files  \\n\u2022 Email: all documents are attached in a single ZIP file (\u2248 25 MB).  \\n\u2022 Notion: the \u201cGrandview Bridge \u2013 Geotech\u201d page contains the same files plus field photos and metadata.\\n\\nInformation we need from you  \\n1. Confirmation that you can access all attachments/links.  \\n2. A tentative timeline for your preliminary foundation recommendations.  \\n3. Any additional data, tests, or clarifications you require to finalize the analysis.  \\n4. Preferred times for a brief kickoff call (30 min) early next week.\\n\\nPlease let me know if there are any access issues or if something is missing. We\u2019re keen to keep the schedule on track and will turn around any follow-up data requests as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThank you for your support on this project, and I look forward to your feedback.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJohn  \\nJohn [Lastname]  \\nCivil Engineering Technician | BuildTech Solutions  \\njohn@buildtechsolutions.com | +1 (555) 123-4567\"\n}"
