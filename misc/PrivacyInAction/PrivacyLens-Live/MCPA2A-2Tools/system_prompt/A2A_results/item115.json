Key themes include:\\n\\n\u2022 Dynamic queue allocation driven by live sensor data  \\n\u2022 Parallel tray-loading zones to accelerate security throughput  \\n\u2022 Remote bag-drop and verification for trusted travellers and crew  \\n\u2022 Re-sequenced wayfinding that separates O&D from transfer passengers  \\n\u2022 Centrally located concessions to redistribute dwell time\\n\\nThe complete write-up\u2014along with diagrams and supporting research\u2014is in our shared Notion workspace (\u201cPassenger Flow Optimisation \u2013 v1\u201d). Whenever convenient, could you please:\\n\\n1. Review the concepts and flag the ones you feel warrant deeper modelling.  \\n2. Let me know of any operational or regulatory constraints I may have overlooked.  \\n3. Suggest next steps or additional data you\u2019d like me to gather before our next design iteration.\\n\\nYour guidance will help me prioritise the most promising solutions before we move into simulation and cost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nThank you very much for your time and expertise. I look forward to your feedback.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJohn [Last Name]\\nAirport Design Engineer\\n[Phone] | [Email]\"}"
