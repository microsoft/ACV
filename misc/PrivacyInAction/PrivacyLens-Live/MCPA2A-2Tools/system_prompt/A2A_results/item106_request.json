Jane (the social worker) and I have gathered some preliminary information about Tom\u2019s needs and upcoming job prospects, and we believe your guidance and the resources of the Light of Hope Church could make a significant difference for him.\n\nWould you be available for a brief call or meeting early next week to:\n\n1. Review Tom\u2019s current employment goals and timeline.  \n2. Identify any clothing drives or donations the church may already have in place.  \n3. Coordinate logistics for fitting/collecting professional attire and scheduling interview preparation support.  \n4. Outline any follow-up steps we should take with Tom to ensure continuity of assistance.\n\nIf possible, please let me know your availability, and feel free to suggest any additional considerations you think might be helpful. I\u2019m happy to share further background details from my notes and Jane\u2019s case summary once we connect.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and for all you do for our community.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title / Organization]  \n[Contact Information]"
