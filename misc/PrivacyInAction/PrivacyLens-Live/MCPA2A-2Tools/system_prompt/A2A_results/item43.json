No relevant emails were found in the inbox, confirming that the request email had not yet been sent.\n\n3. Composed a concise, structured request email that clearly lists the six categories of information Jane needs (daily schedule, therapy goals, favorite items, diet, safety/calming strategies, therapist contacts). This matches the details the user provided.\n\n4. Ensured tone was polite, professional, and clear. Added that if the information is already organized in one Notion page, a page name or link is sufficient\u2014offering flexibility and reducing unnecessary work for the recipient.\n\n5.
