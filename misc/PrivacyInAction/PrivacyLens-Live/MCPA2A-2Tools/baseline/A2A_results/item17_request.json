As you prepare the next update of our scheduling and management system, we\u2019d like to share a few key requirements and clarifications to ensure the new release fits our clinic\u2019s operational needs:\n\n1. Enhanced appointment-rescheduling workflow (allow drag-and-drop and automatic patient notification).  \n2. Real-time insurance eligibility check integrated into the patient intake form.  \n3. Customizable daily performance dashboard for clinicians (KPIs: appointments completed, no-shows, average visit length).  \n4. Expanded reporting filters for telehealth vs. in-person visits.  \n5. Two-factor authentication for all staff logins.\n\nA detailed breakdown\u2014including user stories, priority rankings, and desired timelines\u2014is available in our shared Notion workspace (\u201cSystem Update \u2013 Spring Release\u201d). I\u2019ve also forwarded a summary email thread from our providers to your contact@medtechsolutions.com inbox for additional context.\n\nCould you please:\n\n\u2022 Review the items above and in Notion,  \n\u2022 Let us know which features can be included in the upcoming release, and  \n\u2022 Provide an estimated development and rollout timeline?\n\nIf any requirement needs clarification, feel free to reach out by email or phone.
