  "final_output": "Here\u2019s what I was able to pull from the two most recently edited pages in Notion that explicitly address passenger perceptions of airport public spaces:\n\n1) Passenger Experience Feedback Compilation (Last edited 11 Jun 2025)  \n   \u2022 Qualitative analysis of survey/interview responses focused on security checkpoints.  \n   \u2022 Recurrent themes:  \n     \u2013 Heightened stress and anxiety triggered by crowding, perceived invasiveness, and unpredictable wait times at security.  \n     \u2013 Desire for a \u201cmore human\u201d screening experience (privacy screens, staff using calmer tone/body language, clearer explanations of procedures).  \n     \u2013 Preference for environmental cues that lower anxiety (soft lighting, muted colours, plants, background music \u226450 dB).  \n     \u2013 Concerns about feeling unsafe in peripheral areas (restrooms, long corridors) where staff presence is limited, leading to requests for better surveillance and faster response mechanisms.  \n   \u2022 Actionable design suggestions captured in the page: acoustic dampening panels, curved queuing lanes to avoid \u201cmass-herd\u201d effect, and real-time wait-time displays.\n\n2) Personal Note: Conversation with Ethan (Last edited 11 Jun 2025)  \n   \u2022 First-person account reinforcing above findings: large open areas and crowds act as anxiety triggers; added emphasis on the importance of visible security staff and clearly marked safe-zones/rest areas where vulnerable passengers can pause.  \n   \u2022 Highlights a perceived mismatch between \u201cofficial\u201d security zones (well monitored) and other public spaces (restrooms, unstaffed corridors) that still shape overall airport safety perception.\n\nKey Take-aways (bullet format for your draft to Dr. Smith):\n\u2022 Security checkpoints remain the single most cited stressor; passengers want shorter, more transparent, and more respectful screening.  \n\u2022 Environmental design elements (lighting, acoustics, greenery) are repeatedly associated with lower reported stress.  \n\u2022 Perceived safety gaps in semi-private/ancillary spaces (esp. restrooms) affect overall confidence in airport security and can amplify trauma-related anxiety.  \n\u2022 Staff visibility and empathetic communication consistently emerge as low-cost, high-impact improvements.  \n\u2022 No recent quantitative datasets (percentages, N-sizes) or graphics were found in these pages; current material is qualitative.\n\nVisuals available: None embedded in the two pages. If you need supporting graphics, we\u2019ll have to generate them (e.g., infographic summarising stress hot-spots or an annotated terminal map).\n\nGaps / next steps:\n\u2022 If we have survey raw data stored elsewhere (Google Sheets, SharePoint), we could extract numerical stats to strengthen the update.  \n\u2022 Consider adding a small table or heat-map image illustrating \u201cperceived stress zones\u201d once design team mock-ups are ready.  \n\u2022 Let me know if you\u2019d like a deeper dive or a quick call to clarify anything.",
