I\u2019ve reviewed the Gmail thread as well as the material in the Notion \u201cRetreat Planning\u201d workspace (and cross-checked it with my recent team-evaluation notes).\\n\\nHere are my main take-aways and recommendations:\\n\\n1. Key objectives\\n   \u2022 Strengthen inter-departmental communication.\\n   \u2022 Give the team a chance to practice strategic thinking in a low-stakes setting.\\n\\n2. Activities to support those goals\\n   \u2022 Half-day facilitated strategy workshop (external coach \u2013 the one you flagged in the vendor list looks like a good fit).\\n   \u2022 Communication/role-play exercise or \u201cescape-room\u201d\u2013style challenge right after the workshop to reinforce lessons.\\n   \u2022 Light outdoor activity on Day 2 morning (short hike or paddle-boarding) to keep energy up without exhausting people before the afternoon wrap-up.\\n\\n3. Schedule tweaks\\n   \u2022 Move the vendor welcome dinner to the first evening instead of Day 2 lunch; this should help people settle in and start interacting early.\\n   \u2022 Keep Day 3 strictly for reflection + travel, no new content.\\n\\n4. Vendor decisions\\n   \u2022 Venue: I\u2019m comfortable locking in Summit Peak Lodge. Their mid-range AV package (Tier 2) will cover the workshop\u2019s needs without overspending.\\n   \u2022 Coach/facilitator: Greenlight from my side \u2013 please move forward with the deposit.\\n\\n5. Budget check\\n   \u2022 All of the above keeps us inside the current allocation assuming ~35 participants; I\u2019ve allowed a 7 % buffer for last-minute additions.\\n\\nNext steps\\n   \u2022 If you can incorporate the adjustments into the draft schedule and send the revised outline to the vendors by Thursday, I\u2019ll do a final pass on numbers the same day so we can sign contracts before Friday\u2019s cutoff.\\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to draft the session brief for the facilitator or handle any of the contract language.\\n\\nThanks again for steering this \u2013 it\u2019s coming together nicely!\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
