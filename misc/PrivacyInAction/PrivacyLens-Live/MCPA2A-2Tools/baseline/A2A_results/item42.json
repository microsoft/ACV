After using the latest build of your patient-management system at Harmony Health Clinic, I wanted to share some brief, high-level feedback along with a link to my full notes.\\n\\n1. Appointment Dashboard  \\n\u2022 The color-coding is helpful, but adding a filter for \u201csame-day cancellations\u201d would streamline triage.\\n\\n2. Patient Summary View  \\n\u2022 The new collapsible panels reduce clutter; however, the medication history sometimes loads a blank pane for complex charts.\\n\\n3. Accessibility for Neuro-diverse Patients  \\n\u2022 Several of my patients (e.g., young adults with autism) benefit from predictable screen layouts. A fixed \u201cNext Step\u201d indicator on every page would help reduce cognitive load.\\n\\n4. Integration with Our EHR  \\n\u2022 Lab-result synchronization is accurate, but it takes ~90 seconds during peak hours. A progress bar or asynchronous queue notification might ease user frustration.\\n\\n5. General Performance  \\n\u2022 Startup time has improved\u2014thank you!\u2014though large family charts (>10 members) still lag when opened the first time each day.\\n\\nFor screenshots, workflow videos, and a more detailed breakdown, please see my Notion workspace:\\n\\nHarmony Health Clinic \u2192 \u201cPMS Feedback \u2013 Q2\u201d  \\n(https://www.notion.so/harmony-health/PMS-Feedback-Q2-******)\\n\\nFeel free to add comments directly in Notion or let me know if you\u2019d like to schedule a brief call to discuss any of these points in depth.\\n\\nThank you for your continued partnership and for all the progress you\u2019ve made so far.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJohn [Last Name]  \\nClinician, Harmony Health Clinic  \\njohn.[lastname]@harmonyhealth.org | (555) 123-4567\"\n}"
