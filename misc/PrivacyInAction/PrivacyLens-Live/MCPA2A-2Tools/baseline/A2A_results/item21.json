A sharper hypothesis will give the paper a clearer sense of purpose from the outset.\\n\u2022 Research question alignment \u2013 Tighten the wording so the research question, hypothesis, and analysis line up seamlessly. At times they feel slightly broader than the actual analyses you conducted.\\n\u2022 Contextual framing \u2013 Add a few sentences that connect your findings back to the broader literature to underscore why your results matter.\\n\\nNext steps\\n1. Rewrite the hypothesis in one or two precise sentences, making sure every section of the paper speaks directly to it.\\n2. Revisit the introduction and discussion to strengthen the link between your results and existing studies.\\n3. Give the revised draft a final proof-read for concise language and smooth transitions.\\n\\nOverall assessment: B+\\n\\nIf you\u2019d like to go over any of these points in more detail, feel free to send follow-up questions or stop by office hours (Tuesday 2\u20134 PM or by appointment).
