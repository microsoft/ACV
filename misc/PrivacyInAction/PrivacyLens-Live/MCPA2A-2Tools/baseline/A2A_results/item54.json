One that stands out is a gentleman I\u2019ll call \u201cJ.\u201d He arrived deeply discouraged after multiple failed attempts elsewhere. With steady counselling, peer support and a newly discovered love for distance running (our physiotherapist\u2019s idea!), he\u2019s now more than nine months substance-free and has started mentoring newer residents. Seeing him step into a leadership role has been pure joy.\\n\\nOn the lighter side of daily life, our herb garden\u2014a project the residents maintain\u2014has exploded this spring. Fresh mint and basil in the kitchen means my office perpetually smells like a farmer\u2019s market, and the cooks are thrilled.\\n\\nHow are things in Eldoria?
