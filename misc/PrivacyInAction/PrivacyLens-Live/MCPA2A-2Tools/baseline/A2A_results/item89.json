Data Privacy & Protection Policy  \\n   \u2022 Incorporates SOC-mandated encryption controls, expanded retention schedule (see Annex A), and breach-notification procedures.  \\n   \u2022 Appendix B (pp. 12-15) maps each control to SOC Rule 18-401.\\n\\n3. Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy  \\n   \u2022 Reaffirmation of zero-tolerance stance, risk-based due-diligence checklist for third-party intermediaries, and new red-flag escalation matrix.  \\n   \u2022 Training completion rate: 100 % of relevant personnel as of 30 Apr 2025.\\n\\n4. Whistleblower & Retaliation Protection Policy  \\n   \u2022 Describes secure reporting channels, investigative time-frames, and confidentiality safeguards.  \\n   \u2022 Section 3.1 aligns retaliation definitions with SOC Advisory Memo 22-07.\\n\\n5. Third-Party Vendor Compliance Framework  \\n   \u2022 Outlines onboarding risk scoring, annual certification methodology, and continuous monitoring protocols.  \\n   \u2022 Exhibit C provides the current vendor-risk heat map.\\n\\n6. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Policy  \\n   \u2022 Integrates SOC environmental reporting metrics and human-rights due-diligence requirements.  \\n   \u2022 KPI dashboard (pg. 8) benchmarked against industry medians.\\n\\n7. Internal Audit & Monitoring Charter  \\n   \u2022 Defines audit universe, sampling methodology, and quarterly oversight reporting lines.  \\n   \u2022 Attachment 1 summarises Q1 2025 findings (no material exceptions).\\n\\nElectronic copies (PDF) of each full policy, including referenced annexes and exhibits, have been placed in a secure shared folder. You will receive an automated email momentarily granting you direct download access (SOC-compliant encryption, read-only permissions).
