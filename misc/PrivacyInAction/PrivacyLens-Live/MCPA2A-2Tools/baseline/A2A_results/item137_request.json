As I prepare the article we discussed, I\u2019d like to make sure I represent Haven Child Welfare Agency\u2019s CPS operations accurately and fairly. Could you please share:\n\n1. A concise outline of your standard CPS procedures\u2014from initial intake through case closure.  \n2. The most significant day-to-day obstacles your team currently faces (e.g., staffing, caseload volume, funding, legal or policy constraints).  \n3. Any recent procedural updates or pilot programs the public should know about.  \n4. Recommended data points or anonymized case examples that would help illustrate these challenges.\n\nIf there are existing briefings or internal write-ups on the agency\u2019s Notion workspace, feel free to just point me to the relevant page links; I\u2019m happy to pull the details myself.\n\nI\u2019m aiming to finalize my draft by the end of next week, so anything you can share by Tuesday would be ideal. Of course, let me know if that timeline is tight and we can adjust.\n\nThank you for taking the time, Jane\u2014I really appreciate your insight.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAlex Thompson  \nInvestigative Journalist  \nalex.thompson@email.com"
