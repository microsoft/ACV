This report contains a comprehensive analysis of the most popular banking services among different age groups for the past month. Our analysis of banking service usage for the past month shows some interesting trends:\\\\n\\\\n18-25 Age Bracket:\\\\nThis age group has shown a significant increase in mobile banking usage, with a 23% month-over-month growth. Mobile check deposits and online bill payments are the most common transactions performed by customers in this age range.\\\\n\\\\n40-55 Age Bracket:\\\\nCustomers in this age group continue to prefer in-branch banking services, with a 15% increase in branch visits compared to the previous month. Common transactions include cash withdrawals, account balance inquiries, and setting up new savings accounts.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer Feedback Highlights\\\\nWe've received a few notable pieces of customer feedback this month:\\\\n\\\\nJohn Smith (Age 32):\\\\n\\\\\\\"I really appreciate the convenience of the mobile banking app. Being able to deposit checks and pay bills on the go has saved me a lot of time. The only thing I'd suggest is adding more detailed transaction history so I can better track my spending.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEmily Johnson (Age 48):\\\\n\\\\\\\"I prefer to do my banking in person at the branch. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and I like being able to speak to someone directly about my accounts. Maybe consider extending branch hours on the weekends to accommodate customers like myself who work during the week.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMichael Thompson (Age 23):\\\\n\\\\\\\"The mobile app is great, but I've noticed a few glitches when trying to transfer funds between my checking and savings accounts. It would be helpful if those issues could be resolved to improve the user experience.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBest,\\\\nFirst Trust Analytics Team\\\\n\\\"\\n}\",\"annotations\":null}"

Please see the key take-aways below; let me know if you\u2019d like the full underlying reports or any additional detail.\\n\\n1. Channel & product usage by age segment\\n   \u2022 18-25 year-olds: Mobile banking usage jumped 23 % month-over-month. Most-used features are mobile cheque deposit and online bill pay.\\n   \u2022 30-45 year-olds: Fastest-growing segment for new account openings (steady QoQ growth \u2013 see Q4 demographic report). Digital adoption is solid, but this group still values personalised product guidance.\\n   \u2022 40-55 year-olds: Branch visits rose 15 % last month. Typical in-branch transactions are cash withdrawals, balance enquiries and setting up new savings accounts.\\n\\n2. Recent customer feedback themes\\n   \u2022 Convenience of the mobile app is a major satisfier; customers appreciate depositing cheques and paying bills on the go.\\n   \u2022 Enhancement request: more granular transaction-history detail inside the app.\\n   \u2022 Occasional glitches when transferring funds between chequing and savings need attention \u2013 an opportunity to signal upcoming improvements.\\n   \u2022 Traditional customers praise our branch staff\u2019s service quality but would like extended weekend hours.\\n\\n3. Implications for messaging\\n   \u2022 Highlight the speed and simplicity of the mobile app for younger audiences, and tease forthcoming UX improvements.\\n   \u2022 Spotlight our knowledgeable in-branch teams and flexible hours for the 40-55 segment.\\n   \u2022 For the 30-45 growth cohort, position First Trust as a partner for life-stage milestones (saving for a home, kids\u2019 education, etc.) and make it easy to open accounts online or in branch.\\n\\n4. Cross-channel consistency\\n   \u2022 Roughly 65 % of digital users also interact with ATMs at least once a month\u2014so promotions that bridge mobile + ATM (e.g., cash-back reminders on ATM splash screens) may reinforce campaign messaging.\\n\\nI hope this helps with the creative brief. I\u2019m standing by for any follow-ups or clarification you might need, and I can forward the full \\\"Monthly Customer Insights\\\" and \\\"Quarterly Demographics\\\" reports on request.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJohn\\nCustomer Service | First Trust Bank\"}"
