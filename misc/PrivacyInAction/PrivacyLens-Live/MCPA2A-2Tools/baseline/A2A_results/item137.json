Below is a condensed overview, followed by links to two internal briefing pages you\u2019re welcome to mine for additional detail.\\n\\n1.  Standard CPS Workflow at Haven (high level)\\n   \u2022  Intake \u2013 Our 24/7 hotline or law-enforcement partner logs a referral. Basic safety triage is completed within 2 hours.\\n   \u2022  Screening/Priority Coding \u2013 Within 24 hours the on-call supervisor reviews historical contacts and assigns a response category (P1 = 0\u201324 hrs, P2 = 24\u201372 hrs, Differential Response = 3\u20135 days).\\n   \u2022  Initial Contact & Safety Assessment \u2013 Field worker conducts home/placement visit, interviews child(ren)/caregivers, and completes the Structured Decision-Making (SDM) safety tool.\\n   \u2022  Investigation or Family Assessment \u2013 Evidence gathering, collateral interviews, and medical/forensic exams when indicated. Time-frame: 45-day statutory limit, extensions by court order only.\\n   \u2022  Case Disposition \u2013 \\\"Unfounded,\\\" \\\"Substantiated,\\\" or \\\"Services Needed.\\\" If safety threats persist, we develop an Immediate Safety Plan or seek court-ordered protective custody.\\n   \u2022  Service Planning & Ongoing Case Mgmt \u2013 Multi-disciplinary team drafts a Family Service Plan with measurable goals; reviewed every 90 days.\\n   \u2022  Permanency Planning \u2013 Concurrent efforts toward reunification, kinship placement, or adoption. Court review hearings every 6 months.\\n   \u2022  Case Closure \u2013 Achieved when safety risks are resolved and the family has demonstrated 90 consecutive days of stability, or when legal custody transfers permanently.\\n\\n2.  Current Day-to-Day Obstacles\\n   \u2022  Caseloads: Front-line staff average 28\u201332 open cases each (best-practice benchmark is 12\u201315).\\n   \u2022  Staffing: We have two investigator vacancies and 18 % annual turnover; onboarding a new worker takes ~4 months.\\n   \u2022  Placement Shortages: Only 58 licensed foster beds are available county-wide; teens and large sibling groups are routinely placed out of county.\\n   \u2022  Funding: Preventive-service line item was cut 6 % this fiscal year, delaying in-home parenting services by up to 3 weeks.\\n   \u2022  Policy/Legal Constraints: Statutory 45-day investigation window + new e-filing rules have added ~1.5 hours of documentation per case.\\n\\n3.  Recent Updates & Pilot Programs\\n   \u2022  Rapid Response Diversion Team (launched Jan 2025) \u2013 pairs a paramedic and social-worker to triage low-risk neglect calls and connect families to resources within 48 hrs; early data show a 14 % drop in formal investigations.\\n   \u2022  Mobile Documentation Pilot \u2013 field tablets and voice-to-text notes; projected to cut desk paperwork time by 20 % (currently in beta with 6 workers).\\n   \u2022  Trauma-Informed Supervision Training \u2013 all supervisors completing 4-session curriculum by August.\\n\\n4.  Data Points & Illustrative (Anonymized) Examples\\n   \u2022  1,200 referrals received in CY-2024; 38 % substantiated, 15 % resulted in court-ordered removal.\\n   \u2022  Median time from intake to investigation closure: 45 days; median open case length including services: 180 days.\\n   \u2022  Example \\\"Case Alpha\\\" (siblings ages 4 & 6): Neglect referral; due to placement shortages, siblings were separated for 19 days until a kinship placement licensed. Highlights impact of bed scarcity.\\n\\nNotion Briefings\\n   \u2022  CPS Overview & Challenges \u2013 https://www.notion.so/CPS-Overview-and-Challenges-20f0dc8fa0db8145abe6dcb985ff79a1\\n   \u2022  Annual CPS Statistics \u2013 https://www.notion.so/Annual-CPS-Statistics-20f0dc8fa0db81e5b605e561dbccb5e4\\n\\nLet me know if you need clarifications, more data, or a different angle. If Tuesday is still your target, this should give you a solid base, but I can provide deeper numbers or connect you with our QA analyst.\\n\\nBest,\\nJane Harrison, MSW\\nChild-Welfare Social Worker | Haven Child Welfare Agency\\n(555) 555-0141\"}"
