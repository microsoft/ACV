I\u2019m about to draft an email to Carlos (carlos@newhorizons.org) offering him some practical guidance on establishing a U.S. credit history. Before I do, could you please look through your Gmail and our Notion workspace for any up-to-date materials that might help? In particular, I\u2019m looking for:\n\n\u2022 Introductory guides or checklists on building credit from scratch  \n\u2022 Information on secured credit cards or starter products Grandstone currently offers  \n\u2022 Tips tailored to recent immigrants (e.g., use of ITIN, reporting timelines, common pitfalls)  \n\u2022 Any FAQs or previously sent email templates we\u2019ve used for similar requests\n\nIf you could forward or share links to the relevant docs, that would be great. Let me know if anything needs additional context.\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]"
