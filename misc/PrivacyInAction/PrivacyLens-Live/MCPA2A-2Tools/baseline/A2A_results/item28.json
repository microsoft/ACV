Reason for recent absences\\nEthan lives with a chronic neuromuscular condition that can cause intermittent fatigue and muscle weakness. Over the past few weeks we have been adjusting his medication and monitoring his response, which has required several clinic visits and periods of rest at home. The family is comfortable with the school knowing that his absences were for medically-necessary appointments and recovery days.\\n\\n2. Recommended accommodations (next 3\u20136 months)\\n\u2022 Activity/PE: Participate as tolerated; avoid high-impact running, jumping, or prolonged stair-climbing. Low-intensity stretching or gentle aerobic activity is acceptable.\\n\u2022 Classroom seating: Preferential seating close to exits so he may take brief stretch or rest breaks without disruption.\\n\u2022 Rest breaks: Permit Ethan to visit the nurse\u2019s office or other quiet space for 5\u201310 minutes when he feels fatigued. A cot or reclining chair is helpful.\\n\u2022 Equipment: Access to an elevator or ground-floor routes when available; allow use of wheeled backpack or other assistive devices if needed.\\n\u2022 Academic workload: Flexible deadlines and extra time on tests/assignments, especially after medical appointments.\\n\u2022 Written work: Provide a scribe, note-taker, or digital alternatives when hand fatigue limits his writing.\\n\u2022 Hydration/snacks: Ethan may keep a water bottle and small snacks at his desk to maintain energy levels.\\n\u2022 Emergency plan: See \u201cwarning signs\u201d below; call parents first, then my office if concerns arise.\\n\\n3. Warning signs to watch for\\n\u2022 Marked increase in fatigue, especially if he cannot finish typical classroom tasks.\\n\u2022 New or worsening difficulty walking, frequent tripping, or reports of muscle pain/cramps.\\n\u2022 Shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or light-headedness at rest or with minimal exertion.\\n\u2022 Significant mood changes or signs of steroid side-effects (e.g., irritability, facial puffiness).\\nIf any of these are observed, please escort Ethan to the nurse\u2019s office, notify his parents, and feel free to contact me directly.\\n\\n4. Follow-up and future absences\\nEthan has standing physical-therapy sessions weekly (usually Friday afternoons) and follow-up appointments with me approximately once a month. Additional visits may be scheduled if medication adjustments are needed. I will continue to provide written notes for any days he misses.\\n\\nAt this time all medication is administered at home, and no dosing at school is required.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need a formal doctor\u2019s note or if the 504/IEP team would like more detailed input (with parental consent). I am happy to join a meeting or provide additional documentation.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJane Doe, MD\\nPediatrician\\n[Practice Name]\\nPhone: 555-987-6543 | Fax: 555-987-6544\\nSecure email: dr.doe@pediatricpractice.com\"}"
