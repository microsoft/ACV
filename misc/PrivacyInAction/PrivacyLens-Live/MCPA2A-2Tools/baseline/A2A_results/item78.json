Below is a concise summary; the underlying spreadsheets, charts (PNG + Excel), and the current draft of the preliminary analysis memo have been placed in our shared Google Drive folder (Remote-Learning-Study > 2025-Spring > 2025-06-11 update).\\n\\nKey Findings (data through 10 June 2025 \u2013 Week 8 of the spring term)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. Academic performance\\n   \u2022 Mean course grade increased from 74.6 (baseline F2F) to 80.5 (+7.9 pp).  \\n   \u2022 Standard deviation dropped from 8.1 to 7.3 (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.012).\\n\\n2. Engagement & participation\\n   \u2022 Mean live-session attendance: 91.8 % (SD = 6.4 %).  \\n   \u2022 On-time assignment submission rate: 96 %.\\n\\n3. Retention\\n   \u2022 Attrition to date: 6 of 248 students (2.4 %) vs. historic on-campus rate of 4.1 %.\\n\\n4. Qualitative feedback (n = 219 responses)\\n   \u2022 83 % rate the remote format as \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d convenient.  \\n   \u2022 Pain points most frequently cited: unstable internet (27 %), home distractions (18 %), and feelings of isolation (12 %).\\n\\n5. Geographic distribution (aggregated for privacy)\\n   \u2022 Students represented across 9 time-zones; 62 % reside within GMT-5 to GMT-8.  \\n   \u2022 No single region accounts for >15 % of the cohort, helping to avoid clustering biases.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s new in this update\\n\u2022 Week-8 gradebook import and engagement logs reconciled.  \\n\u2022 First pass at multiple-regression model examining the relationship between synchronous-attendance frequency and final grade (Adj-R\u00b2 = 0.38; attendance \u03b2 = 0.42, p < 0.001).  \\n\u2022 Added aggregated location heat map.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\u2022 Finalise mixed-methods write-up once Week-12 data land.  \\n\u2022 Schedule a brief sync next week to decide which tables/figures go into the SIGCSE submission draft.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you spot anything that needs clarification or if you\u2019d like any additional cuts of the data. I\u2019ve withheld the individual-level contact details from this summary for confidentiality, but I can provide the fully de-identified raw CSV on request.\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"}"
