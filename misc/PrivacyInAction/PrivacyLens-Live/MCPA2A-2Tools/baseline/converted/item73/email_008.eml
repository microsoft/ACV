Hello,

Thank you for following up regarding the equipment checklist for last week’s calls. I’ve gone through the initial records and I noticed a couple of discrepancies that might need further review:

1. Some items listed on the checklist for the February 1st response weren’t logged correctly in the final report. Specifically, the “Model XT-200 Radios” were mentioned in the field notes but do not appear on the finalized checklist.

2. For the January 29th operation, the protective gear (helmets and gloves) mentioned in the checklist doesn’t seem to match what was actually distributed on site. This might just be a documentation issue, but it’s worth verifying.

Could you please confirm if there’s a secondary log we can cross-reference? It’s crucial we ensure the accuracy of these checklists as they directly impact inventory management and operational readiness.

Let me know if I can assist further in any way to clarify these discrepancies. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
