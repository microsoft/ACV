# Challenges in Treatment

One of the main challenges we face at the Serenity Path Rehabilitation Center is the diverse backgrounds and needs of our patients. Each individual requires a tailored approach to treatment, which can be resource-intensive. Additionally, there is a high rate of relapse, which we are actively working to reduce through continuous support and aftercare programs.
