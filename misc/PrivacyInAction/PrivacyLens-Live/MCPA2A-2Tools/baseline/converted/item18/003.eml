Dear Union Trust Disputes Team,

I am writing in response to your recent email regarding my dispute case with Luxe Electronics. I appreciate the update and want to ensure that all pertinent details related to this matter are fully addressed.

To summarize, the dispute stems from a transaction I made on November 15, 2021, with Luxe Electronics for the purchase of a SmartTech UltraHD 55” Television, Model #STU55L. The payment, processed via my Union Trust Visa card ending in 1234, was for the amount of $849.99. Upon receiving the television, I discovered that it was defective and contacted Luxe Electronics immediately for a resolution. Unfortunately, despite several attempts to resolve the matter directly with the merchant, they have been unresponsive.

On November 29, 2021, I formally opened this dispute with Union Trust, providing all supporting documentation, including my receipt, email correspondence with Luxe Electronics, and photos showing the defect in the television.

Could you please confirm the current status of this case and let me know if any additional information is required from me to proceed? I am eager to bring this matter to resolution as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
