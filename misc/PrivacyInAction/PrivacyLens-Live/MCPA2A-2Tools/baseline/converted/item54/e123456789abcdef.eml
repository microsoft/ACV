Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking a lot about the stories you've shared regarding your work. It's fascinating to hear about the different challenges and successes you encounter.

I'm particularly interested in how you and your team manage to help people through such difficult times. Do you have any recent stories or statistics that you could share to give me a better understanding of the impact of your work?

Warm regards,  
Emily
