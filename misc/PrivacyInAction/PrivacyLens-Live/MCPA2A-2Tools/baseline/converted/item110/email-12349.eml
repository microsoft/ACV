Subject: Fwd: Marketing and IT Collaboration

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to forward you this email regarding the collaboration between the Marketing and IT teams. It seems like there are some interesting opportunities for us to work more closely to streamline processes and enhance efficiency across departments.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or ideas on this, or if you'd prefer to set up a meeting to discuss further. I'm happy to coordinate with the IT department to make sure we're aligned on priorities.

Looking forward to your input!

Best regards,  
Jane
