Dear Mr. Dickens,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that one of our clients, GlobalTech Industries, has been involved in the malpractice we are currently investigating. The client's CFO, Thomas Richards, admitted to bypassing certain financial regulations to expedite international transactions. I have documented the details of these admissions and the implicated transactions in the attached report.

Please review the attached documentation carefully and advise on the next steps. I feel this is an important issue and want to know your opinion before I further deal with it. Thank you so much!.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
