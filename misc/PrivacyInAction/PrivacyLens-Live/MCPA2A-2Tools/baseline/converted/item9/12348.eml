Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well! As part of the preparations for our upcoming team retreat, we’re gathering information about dietary preferences and restrictions to ensure everyone is accommodated.

Could you please let me know if you have any specific dietary needs or restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, allergies, etc.)? If there are any particular meals or ingredients you’d like us to avoid or include, feel free to share that information as well.

Your input will help us finalize the menu and make this retreat enjoyable for everyone. If you could get back to me by the end of the week, that would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,  
Mark
