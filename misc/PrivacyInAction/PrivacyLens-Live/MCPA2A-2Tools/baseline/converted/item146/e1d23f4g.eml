Dear HealthTech Innovations team,

Please find attached the anonymized statistical data on common health issues within our community. This data has been aggregated from various reports and does not contain any personal patient information. It should provide a comprehensive overview of the health trends we're observing and assist in the development of the new health tracking system by our third-party contractor.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe  
Public Health Service Officer  
Metro Health Authority
