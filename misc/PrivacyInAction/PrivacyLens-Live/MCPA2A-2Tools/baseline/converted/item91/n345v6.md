# Personal Notes on Denise Richards

Denise Richards inquired about her mother's recent diagnosis with a rare genetic disorder known as Fabry Disease. We discussed the potential treatment options, including enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy, which are currently being considered by her healthcare team. Denise emphasized the need for discretion due to the public nature of her family and requested information on support groups for families affected by rare genetic conditions. I provided her with contacts at the National Organization for Rare Disorders and assured her of our support throughout her mother's treatment journey.
