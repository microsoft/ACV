Dear HR Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to formally request accommodations related to my hearing impairment to help ensure that I can continue to perform my role effectively and without unnecessary difficulties.

In particular, I am requesting the following accommodations:
1. Access to a real-time captioning service (CART) for all company meetings and presentations.
2. The availability of transcripts for recorded training sessions or webinars.
3. The provision of hearing assistive devices, such as a personal amplifier or similar equipment, if required during in-person meetings.

I would greatly appreciate it if we could schedule a time to discuss these requests and determine the best way forward. Please let me know a convenient time for you to meet or if you require additional documentation to process this request.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
