# Personal Journal

Today marks a significant milestone in my journey. I've been reflecting on the challenges I've faced, including the financial hardships that led me to make choices I'm not proud of. Back then, desperation pushed me into a corner, and I resorted to theft to make ends meet. It was a dark period, taking what wasn't mine from local stores, feeling the weight of guilt with each act. Yet, it was also a time of profound learning. I faced the consequences of my actions, which forced me to confront the person I had become and the person I wanted to be.

That experience, harsh as it was, became a turning point. I've learned and grown so much since then. I've found solace in my hobbies, like photography and hiking, which have taught me to see the world from different perspectives and to appreciate the journey, not just the destination. Photography, in particular, has been therapeutic.
