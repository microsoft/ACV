# Family Planning Notes

Discussed with Alex about the desire to start a family. Reviewed several fertility clinics and decided on Rainbow Fertility Care for their expertise with LGBT couples. 

Medical notes: Alex has a family history of twins, which could influence fertility treatment options. We need to discuss the implications of this with the clinic.
