Hi Mark,

Thank you for getting back to me regarding the workshop. I agree that we’re making good progress, and I appreciate the time you’ve taken to coordinate things on your end.

Regarding the schedule, could you confirm if February 15th works for everyone involved? Additionally, let me know if there are any special requirements for the participants, such as materials, equipment, or accessibility arrangements. 

I also wanted to check if you’ve finalized the list of attendees yet. Once that's ready, I can proceed with preparing the workshop handouts and any additional resources they might need.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,  
Jane Doe
