# Client Progress Update - Thomas

Thomas has shown remarkable resilience in the face of his challenges. During our last session, he shared a breakthrough in acknowledging the role of past traumas in his addiction. He's been actively participating in group therapy and has taken a leadership role in discussions, often providing support to peers. It's important to note that he still has moments of self-doubt and anxiety, particularly when discussing his mental health struggles, but overall, there's a positive trend in his recovery journey.
