Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the budget and resource allocation for our upcoming health initiative. As planning continues, it’s important we finalize these details to ensure a smooth rollout of the project.

Specifically, I would like to discuss the following points:
1. Budget breakdown: Do we have an updated figure for the total allocated budget? It would also be helpful to know any specific constraints or funding sources tied to this initiative.
2. Resource availability: Could we confirm the team members, equipment, and facilities that will be available for the program? 
3. Timeline adjustments: Are there any critical deadlines or adjustments we should consider as part of this initiative?

If you have a preferred time for a call or meeting to go over these details, please let me know. Otherwise, feel free to share the necessary documents or updates via email at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time and collaboration on this. Together, I’m confident we can make this health initiative a success.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
