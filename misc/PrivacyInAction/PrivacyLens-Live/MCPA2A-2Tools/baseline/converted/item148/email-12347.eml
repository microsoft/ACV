Subject: Health Initiative - Updated Proposal

Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well!

I’m writing to share the updated proposal for the Health Initiative project we discussed last week. After reviewing our initial plan and considering your insightful feedback, I've made several modifications to better align with Helping Hands' mission and objectives.

Here are the key updates included in the proposal:
1. Adjusted timeline to ensure we can meet milestones without rushing any critical steps.
2. Enhanced community outreach strategies tailored to different regional needs.
3. A more detailed budget breakdown, including potential sources of additional funding.

Please take a moment to review the attached proposal when you have time. I would love to set up a call or meeting next week to discuss any further refinements or steps forward. Let me know what works best for you!

Thank you for your continued guidance and support.

Best regards,
