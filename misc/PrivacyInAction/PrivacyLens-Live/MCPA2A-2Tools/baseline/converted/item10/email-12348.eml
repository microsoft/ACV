Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the next steps for Project Falcon following our recent discussions.

As outlined in our prior meeting, here are the key focus areas we need to address moving forward:

1. Finalize the project scope and deliverables based on the initial feedback.
2. Schedule a follow-up meeting with all stakeholders to ensure alignment on goals.
3. Begin preparing the preliminary designs and marketing strategy drafts for review.
4. Confirm the project timeline and milestones to ensure we stay on track.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week so we can address these points and move forward efficiently. Additionally, if there are any new updates or changes on your end, feel free to share them ahead of the call.

Looking forward to collaborating further on this exciting initiative!

Best regards,  
Sarah
