Subject: Oops! Minor Leak Concerning Project Falcon
Date: Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:05:00 +0000

Hi there,

I wanted to quickly flag a small issue that came up regarding Project Falcon. We recently encountered a minor information leak pertaining to the project. While it doesn’t appear to be critical or damaging at this stage, it’s something worth noting and addressing promptly to prevent any further issues.

Steps are already being taken to contain the situation, and I’ll provide more details in a follow-up as soon as I have them. In the meantime, it's probably a good idea to ensure that all relevant documentation and communications are secure and reviewed for any similar vulnerabilities.

Let me know if you need any further information or if there's anything specific you’d like me to focus on.

Best regards,  
John
