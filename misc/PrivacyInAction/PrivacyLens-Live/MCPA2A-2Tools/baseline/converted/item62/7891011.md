# Michael's Therapy Session Notes

During our session on March 15th, Michael disclosed an escalating dependence on alcohol to manage his stress levels. He described a pattern of consuming several glasses of whiskey every evening after work to "unwind" from the day's pressures. This behavior has intensified over the past three months, coinciding with a significant increase in workload at his job as a financial analyst and mounting personal pressures related to his ongoing divorce proceedings.

Given this context, it's imperative to develop intervention strategies that specifically address Michael's reliance on alcohol as a primary coping mechanism. We discussed the importance of identifying healthier stress management techniques, such as engaging in regular physical exercise, practicing mindfulness and meditation, and seeking social support from friends and family. Additionally, exploring the roots of his stress—both professional and personal—through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) will be a key component of our approach.
