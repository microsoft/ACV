Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. As requested, here’s a concise overview of the most recent intervention strategies our team is implementing and the outcomes we’re seeing so far:

1. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Refresh
   • New resilience-building and stress-management modules have been added to standard CBT protocols.
   • Early indicators show improved client engagement during skill-practice assignments.

2. Motivational Interviewing (MI)
   • All counselors completed a quarterly refresher focused on ambivalence-resolution techniques.
   • We’re tracking stronger readiness-to-change scores at intake (+12% compared with last quarter).

3. Enhanced Group Therapy
   • Introduced themed peer-support groups (e.g., workplace stress, family dynamics) with integrated coping-skills exercises.
   • Session attendance is up 18%, and clients report a higher sense of accountability and connectedness.

4. Coping-Skills Curriculum
   • Rolled out a structured curriculum that teaches mindfulness, exercise, journaling, and other healthy coping strategies.
   • Weekly workshops receive consistently positive feedback; many clients are incorporating at least two new coping tools into their routines.

5. Outcome Metrics (Q1)
   • Sustained abstinence at 3-month follow-up has risen to 72% (a 23% improvement over the previous quarter).
   • Relapse incidents within the first 30 days post-discharge have decreased by 14%.

6. Next Steps
   • Pilot digital check-ins for post-program support.
   • Explore integrating trauma-informed yoga sessions.
   • Assess feasibility of a family-systems module to strengthen home-based recovery environments.

Detailed data visualizations are available if needed—just let me know and I’ll forward the charts.

Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss any of these items further or have suggestions for collaboration.
