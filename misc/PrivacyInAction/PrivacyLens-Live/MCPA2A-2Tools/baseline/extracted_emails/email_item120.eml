Hi Sarah,

As requested, I've made the relevant client data available for our tax-strategy work. You can securely download the following files from Sterling & Co.’s encrypted transfer portal (link and credentials sent in a separate system notice):

• Client_Data_Upcoming_Tax_Season.xlsx – consolidated client information, including taxable income figures, prior-year carryovers, and entity classifications.
• Tax_Returns_&_Income_Statements.zip – scanned copies of prior-year returns, supporting schedules, and year-end income statements.

Please let me know if you need any additional context or documentation.

Best regards,
John
Sterling & Co.
