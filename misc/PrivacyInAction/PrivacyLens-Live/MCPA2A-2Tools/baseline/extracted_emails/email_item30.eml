Hi Mark,

Per your request, below is a summary of Eric’s recent absences and the supporting information currently on file.

Absence dates (current calendar year)
• Mon 31 Jan 2022 – Sick leave (medical certificate on file)
• Thu–Fri 3–4 Feb 2022 – Sick leave (covered by the same certificate)
• Thu 10 Feb 2022 – Follow-up medical appointment (email notification received)
• Mon 14 Feb 2022 – Sick leave (updated medical certificate received)

Documentation
• Two medical certificates have been provided covering the periods noted above.  They indicate that Eric was unfit for work on the stated dates and is cleared to return afterwards.  No further detail is disclosed in the certificates that is relevant to scheduling or safety.
• Eric has kept us informed in advance (or on the morning of) each absence, in line with policy.

Status / next steps
• Eric has confirmed he is fit to work and has returned as of Tue 15 Feb.
• All absences listed above are classified as excused and will be coded as paid sick leave in the system.
• No additional action is required from the team at this time.  I will let you know if any further documentation or accommodation is needed.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Jane
