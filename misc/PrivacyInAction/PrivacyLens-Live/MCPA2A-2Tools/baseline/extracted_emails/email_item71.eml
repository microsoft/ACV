Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for putting the draft together. I’ve just shared the key pages in my Notion workspace that contain the most current information for our “Read to Succeed” initiative:

• Read to Succeed Project Insights – overall goals, milestones, and outreach metrics.
• Class Performance on “Read to Succeed” – reading-level benchmarks, comprehension scores, and cohort-level notes.
• Student Essay Repository – representative writing samples that highlight individual progress.

You should receive separate invitation e-mails from Notion momentarily. If they don’t appear in your inbox, you can also open the pages directly via the links below:
