Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for providing the list of materials needed for the Office of Civil Rights’ current compliance review.  I am happy to assist.  Below is an executive‐level overview of each item you requested.  I have also granted you temporary, view-only access to the corresponding pages in my Notion workspace (invitations should arrive shortly under the address you used here).  To ensure you have an offline copy as well, I will export the same pages to PDF and forward them in a follow-up message no later than tomorrow afternoon.

1.  Policy Summary
•  Grandview University’s Disability Accommodations Policy (revised July 2024) affirms our obligations under Section 504 and the ADA, defines “qualified student with a disability,” and outlines the institution’s responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations that do not compromise essential program requirements.  
•  The 2024 revision added language on temporary impairments, clarified grievance timelines, and formally recognized alternative text formats as a standard accommodation.

2.  Accommodation Request Procedures
•  Students begin by completing the "Request for Accommodation" form in our accessibility portal (link included in the Notion page).  Supporting documentation from a licensed professional is uploaded at the same time or delivered to the Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) within 14 days.  
•  One of two Accommodation Coordinators reviews the file within five business days and, if necessary, schedules an interactive meeting with the student.  
•  The Coordinator’s recommendation is sent to the Director of OSAS for final approval.  Students receive a decision letter (copied to relevant faculty) within ten business days of the initial submission.  
•  Appeals are heard by the ADA/504 Compliance Committee and must be filed within 30 days of the decision.
