Hi Sarah,

Thanks for checking in! Here’s the most up-to-date snapshot from our side. I will also drop the same information into the “Community Care Day” page in Notion so we keep one shared source of truth.

1. DATE & TIME
• Date: Saturday, 15 March (confirmed)
• Time: still flexible – the working plan is 9:00 AM–3:00 PM. I’ll lock this after our parish-board check-in early next week and will update you right away if anything shifts.

2. LOCATION / ROOM ASSIGNMENTS (draft)
• Parish Hall (main floor): Opening ceremony, clothing & food distribution tables
• Classrooms A–B (off the east corridor): Free medical check-ups
• Hall foyer + overflow corridor: Job-fair tables for local businesses
• Outdoors / south lawn: Children’s and family activity zone (weather-permitting)
I’ll produce a simple layout map once the board signs off on the set-up.

3. SERVICE STATIONS & RUN-OF-SHOW (subject to minor tweaks)
09:00  Welcome & opening prayer
09:30  Distribution stations open
10:00  Health clinic + job fair begin
12:00  Community lunch available (sandwiches & soup)
14:30  Last call at all stations
14:45  Closing remarks / gratitude
15:00  Break-down begins

4. VOLUNTEER ROLES STILL SEEKING COVERAGE
• 3–4 greeters/floaters to help with way-finding & general support
• 2–3 extra hands at the clothing/food tables (box lifting & restocking)
• 2 volunteers for the medical-area check-in desk
• 2 leaders for the children’s activity zone
If Helping Hands has folks interested in any of these, just send the names and we’ll plug them into the roster.

5. PROMOTIONAL LANGUAGE / GRAPHICS
Draft copy we’re using for the parish bulletin:
“St. Mary’s Parish & Helping Hands United invite you to COMMUNITY CARE DAY – a free day of resources, health services, and family fun for our neighbours. Saturday, 15 March, 9 AM–3 PM at St. Mary’s Parish Hall, 58 Oak St. All are welcome!”

Our youth-group designer is finishing a one-page flyer and social-media graphic; I expect to have those by Monday (19 Feb). I’ll forward both files as soon as they land in my inbox so your team can adapt as needed.

6. KEY DEADLINES (working list)
• 25 Feb – Room layout & equipment order finalised
• 01 Mar – Volunteer list locked & orientation email sent
• 05 Mar – Promo materials distributed community-wide
• 14 Mar – Evening set-up (6:00 PM) & walk-through with station leads

Please let me know what tweaks you’d like or if there’s anything missing on your end. I’m happy to jump on a quick call later this week, too.

Gratefully,
John
St. Mary’s Parish
