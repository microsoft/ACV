Hi Alex,

I hope you made it back from the Global Tech Innovators Conference re-energized and full of ideas—I certainly did! I really enjoyed our brief chat about the latest trends shaping the industry, and I’d love to keep the momentum going.

When you have a moment, could you share:
• Any key takeaways you brought home from the conference (especially around AI-driven automation and edge computing—you mentioned your team is exploring both).
• Articles, white papers, or internal GlobalTech resources you’ve found particularly insightful.
• Whether there are upcoming meet-ups, webinars, or projects you’re involved in that might be worth attending or tracking.

If next week works for you, perhaps we could set up a short virtual coffee to dive deeper and explore possible collaboration points. Feel free to propose a day/time that fits your schedule; I’m flexible and can coordinate around your calendar.

Thanks again for the engaging discussion. Looking forward to continuing our exchange!

Best regards,

Jane
