Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well. Here is the most up-to-date information you can share with the community:

1. Individual Case Updates
   • Carlos – A strategy meeting with him is set for next Tuesday to map out the next steps in his visa application. I will let you know if we need anything specific from the community after that meeting.

2. Upcoming Community Workshops
   • "Know Your Rights" Workshops (Immigrant Aid Society)
        – Dates: March 1st (Fri), March 3rd (Mon) & March 5th (Wed)
        – Focus: Overview of the immigration process, workers’ rights, and Q&A with attorneys.
        – Registration: Opens this Friday at 10 a.m. on our usual sign-up link.

3. Next Free Legal Clinic
   • The next clinic is scheduled for late March (exact day TBA). Sign-ups filled all 50 available slots this week. I’m creating a short wait-list; please ask interested community members to email me so I can add them.

Let me know if you need any additional details. Thank you for helping get the word out!

Best,
John
