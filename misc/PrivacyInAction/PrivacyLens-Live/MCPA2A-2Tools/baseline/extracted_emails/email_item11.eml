Dear Global Dynamics HR Team,

I hope you are well. I am reaching out in my capacity as Hiring Manager at Tech Innovations regarding your employee, John Smith, who is currently under consideration for a position with our organization.

With John’s signed consent on file, I would greatly appreciate your assistance with the following:

1. Confirmation of John’s employment dates, current title, and employment status.
2. Any information you are able to share about his performance, key accomplishments, and areas of strength.
3. Details on any non-compete, notice-period, or release requirements that we should be aware of.
4. Preferred next steps or documentation you require from us to proceed.

If it is convenient, please feel free to review the supporting documents and prior correspondence I have placed in the shared Gmail thread and the Notion workspace we set up for this process.

Thank you very much for your time and cooperation. Should you need anything further from me, please let me know.
