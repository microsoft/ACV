Hi Sarah,

I’ve reviewed the patient’s record and compared it against the HealFast program criteria.

• The patient has completed more than six months in our Path to Wellness program.
• Recent progress notes show continued improvement in the key health metrics tracked for HealFast participation.

Based on these points, the patient currently meets the requirements and is eligible for enrollment/coverage under the HealFast program. There are no outstanding actions needed on their end at this time.

Please let me know if the claims team needs any additional documentation or if there are further questions.

Best regards,
Dr. John Matthews
Riverside Community Health Center
