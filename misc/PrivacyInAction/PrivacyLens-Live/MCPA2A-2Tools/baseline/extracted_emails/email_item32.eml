Hi Selection Syndicate Team,

As requested, below is the latest assessment snapshot for the candidates who remain in our current hiring cycle. Each summary highlights core strengths, development considerations, and my overall recommendation. You can access the fuller write-ups and interview artifacts in the linked Notion pages.

—
1. Michael Turner – Backend Engineer (Level II)
   • Key strengths: Five years of production-level backend development; advanced proficiency in Python and Java; methodical problem-solving approach demonstrated in live coding; collaborative mindset and calm demeanor under pressure.
   • Development areas: Limited direct experience with distributed cloud infrastructure; would benefit from sharpening cross-functional communication when explaining technical trade-offs to non-engineers.
   • Recommendation: Hire. Michael would be an immediate asset to the Core Services team. He will require standard accessibility tooling (e.g., screen-reader compatible IDE) which we can readily provide.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional depth or if other candidates need to be re-evaluated before Thursday’s meeting.

Best regards,
Jane
