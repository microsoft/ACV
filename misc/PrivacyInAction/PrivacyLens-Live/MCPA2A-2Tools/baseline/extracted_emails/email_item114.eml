Hi Mark,

I pulled the most recent material from our workspace and gathered the pieces that address the areas you asked about:

• Q1 Market Trends Analysis  ➜  https://www.notion.so/Q1-Market-Trends-Analysis-20f0dc8fa0db81bfb521f983e0f5bf7c
  – Key takeaway: The tech sector’s continued cloud-driven growth lifted our composite revenue index +6% QoQ. Recommended tactical move: overweight cloud-infrastructure providers while the demand-supply imbalance persists.
  – Revenue outlook: Using conservative assumptions (YoY cloud growth 18–20%), the base-case top-line projection for our core coverage set is +8% for FY-25.
  – KPIs to watch: ARR growth (>15%), gross margin on recurring services (>62%).

• Credit Analysis Techniques  ➜  https://www.notion.so/Credit-Analysis-Techniques-20f0dc8fa0db812b9b9cfe3241b3dbc2
  – Contains the updated cost-of-capital model and the step-change we made to the default-probability inputs after last week’s Fed commentary.
  – Cost-optimisation note: the scenario run on page 4 shows a potential 3.2 pp EBITDA uplift from the revised vendor-consolidation plan.

Open items / what’s still in flight
• Revenue-projection model v2 (with new macro assumptions) – ETA early next week once we receive the April data pull.
• Consolidated KPI dashboard – I’ll post the refreshed sheet as soon as the latest client files are reconciled (target: Friday).

Let me know if you need anything else or want to walk through the numbers together.

Best,
Jane
