Hi Data & Assessment Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I need your assistance preparing a data set for Mr. Thomas Green (EdTech Innovations) so we can respond to his recent inquiry about integrating our students’ aggregated performance metrics into their learning platform.

Could you please pull together the following information by Friday, June 14?

• Grade-level average scores for Math, English, Science, and Social Studies for the past two semesters  
• Distribution of proficiency bands (e.g., % of students at “Below Basic,” “Basic,” “Proficient,” “Advanced”) for each subject and grade level  
• High-level engagement statistics from our LMS (average daily log-ins, average minutes on task per student, assignment completion rates)  
• Any existing dashboards or summary reports teachers currently receive that we can safely share externally

Important: Please ensure the file is fully anonymized and free of any personally identifiable information so we remain FERPA-compliant.

Reference materials:
• Mr. Green’s original request: Gmail → label “EdTech Innovations” → thread dated 6/5  
• Data-sharing guidelines: Notion → Tech Partnerships / EdTech Innovations / Data Policy

Once the report is ready, please drop it in our shared “EdTech Innovations” Drive folder and ping me so I can review before sending.

Thank you for your quick help with this—let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
