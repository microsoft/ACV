Hi NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re doing well. Could you please pull the most recent notes, key take-aways, and standout examples from “The Muse’s Ledger” (John’s Creative Writing class workspace) for me? John would like to include a concise set of insights—innovative exercises, reading recommendations, and any notable student achievements—in an introductory email to Emily (emily@literatureenthusiasts.org).

Whenever possible, could you send the extracted highlights—or a link to the specific Notion page—to me by this afternoon?

Many thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Assistant to John
