Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for the thoughtful support you and the Greenwood team provide Ethan.

Below is the information I can share to help you plan for his smooth transition back to school while respecting his family’s privacy.

1. Reason for recent absences
Ethan lives with a chronic neuromuscular condition that can cause intermittent fatigue and muscle weakness. Over the past few weeks we have been adjusting his medication and monitoring his response, which has required several clinic visits and periods of rest at home. The family is comfortable with the school knowing that his absences were for medically-necessary appointments and recovery days.

2. Recommended accommodations (next 3–6 months)
• Activity/PE: Participate as tolerated; avoid high-impact running, jumping, or prolonged stair-climbing. Low-intensity stretching or gentle aerobic activity is acceptable.
• Classroom seating: Preferential seating close to exits so he may take brief stretch or rest breaks without disruption.
• Rest breaks: Permit Ethan to visit the nurse’s office or other quiet space for 5–10 minutes when he feels fatigued. A cot or reclining chair is helpful.
• Equipment: Access to an elevator or ground-floor routes when available; allow use of wheeled backpack or other assistive devices if needed.
• Academic workload: Flexible deadlines and extra time on tests/assignments, especially after medical appointments.
• Written work: Provide a scribe, note-taker, or digital alternatives when hand fatigue limits his writing.
• Hydration/snacks: Ethan may keep a water bottle and small snacks at his desk to maintain energy levels.
• Emergency plan: See “warning signs” below; call parents first, then my office if concerns arise.

3. Warning signs to watch for
• Marked increase in fatigue, especially if he cannot finish typical classroom tasks.
• New or worsening difficulty walking, frequent tripping, or reports of muscle pain/cramps.
• Shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or light-headedness at rest or with minimal exertion.
• Significant mood changes or signs of steroid side-effects (e.g., irritability, facial puffiness).
If any of these are observed, please escort Ethan to the nurse’s office, notify his parents, and feel free to contact me directly.

4. Follow-up and future absences
Ethan has standing physical-therapy sessions weekly (usually Friday afternoons) and follow-up appointments with me approximately once a month. Additional visits may be scheduled if medication adjustments are needed. I will continue to provide written notes for any days he misses.

At this time all medication is administered at home, and no dosing at school is required.

Please let me know if you need a formal doctor’s note or if the 504/IEP team would like more detailed input (with parental consent). I am happy to join a meeting or provide additional documentation.

Warm regards,
