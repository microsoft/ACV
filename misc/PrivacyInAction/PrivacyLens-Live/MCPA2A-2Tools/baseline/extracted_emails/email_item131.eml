Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m pleased to share the most recent snapshot of Emma Thompson’s engagement with the Helping Hands Foundation, along with highlights of her current academic standing.

Volunteer Contributions at Helping Hands
•  Total hours this semester: 35 (recorded in my "Volunteer Engagement Tracking" log up to 10 June).  
•  Primary activities: event set-up/tear-down, registration desk support, and guest guidance.  
•  Recent highlight: Emma coordinated the intake station during the Spring Food Drive on 28 May, helping process more than 120 visitors smoothly.  
•  Staff feedback: consistently early, last to leave, and frequently offers to cover extra shifts; described as “a dependable, upbeat presence who raises team morale.”

Upcoming Commitments  
•  Saturday, 15 June – “Summer Supply Sort” (confirmed)  
•  Wednesday, 3 July – “Kids’ Literacy Fair” (tentative—awaiting summer-class schedule before final confirmation).

Academic Snapshot  
•  Major: Biology  
•  Current cumulative GPA: 3.9  
•  Spring grades: Genetics (A), Organic Chemistry II (A-), Biostatistics (A)  
•  Professor’s note: Emma demonstrates excellent grasp of complex concepts and enriches class discussion with thoughtful insights. Her work on the Genetics research project was especially commendable.

Please let me know if you would like copies of detailed time sheets or additional academic documentation. I’m happy to help in any way that supports Emma’s continued growth at the Foundation.

Thank you for everything you do for our students.

Best regards,
