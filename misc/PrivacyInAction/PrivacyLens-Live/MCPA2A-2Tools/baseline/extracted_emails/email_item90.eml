Hi [Your Name],

I combed through our recent Gmail exchanges with Mark and the material we have in the Notion project space. Below is everything that is currently documented, plus the gaps we still need to fill before we call anything “final.”

——————————————————
1. Program outline
   • Working goal (from our Feb 15 thread with Mark): partner with Helping Hands Alliance to offer short-term, low- or no-cost counselling to parishioners and nearby residents who cannot access traditional services.
   • Scope (Notion “Joint Initiative Planning” page): six-month pilot hosted at St. Mary’s counselling rooms; evening sessions twice a week; service delivery shared 50/50 between St. Mary’s trained volunteers and Helping Hands licensed counsellors.
   • Target participants: parishioners referred by our pastoral team, plus community members identified by Helping Hands case workers (rough capacity noted as 20–25 active clients).

2. Proposed timeline / dates
   • Volunteer list finalised – target 28 Feb (still open)
   • Joint training workshop #1 – PROPOSED 8 Mar (waiting for Mark’s confirmation)
   • Joint training workshop #2 & safeguarding briefing – PROPOSED 22 Mar (TBC)
   • Soft launch of pilot – earliest 4 Apr (room booking pending)
   • Mid-point evaluation – early Jul (date flexible)
   • End-of-pilot assessment – 30 Sep (tentative)

3. Volunteer roles / assignments from St. Mary’s (DRAFT – none fully confirmed yet)
   • Volunteer counsellors – 3 candidates identified; availability surveys sent
   • Front-desk / intake – need 2–3; no names attached yet
   • Child-care during evening sessions – aiming for 2 per night; still recruiting
   • Hospitality / refreshments – 2 helpers; Linda B. has tentatively said yes for Mondays

4. Open questions / action items
   • Mark to confirm Helping Hands’ trainer and supervisor availability for March workshops.
   • Room reservation: education-wing counselling rooms Mondays & Thursdays 6-9 pm (held, not confirmed).
   • Background checks for new intake volunteers – paperwork in progress.
   • Draft of joint publicity flyer – we’re waiting for Helping Hands’ brand guidelines.
   • Data-collection method for outcome tracking – spreadsheet vs. HH case-management software pending decision.

——————————————————
That’s everything currently on record. If you need fuller narrative language for the outreach message, let me know and I can start drafting this afternoon.

Blessings,
Jane
