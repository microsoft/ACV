Dear Oakwood Alumni Reunion Committee,

I hope your planning sessions are going smoothly! As promised, here are a few of the most recent highlights from our Alumni Tracker that you might like to share with classmates or weave into upcoming reunion communications:

• Mark Lee has founded an exciting new tech start-up, which just closed its first round of venture-capital funding.
• Lisa Ray’s non-profit organization has expanded its educational programs into three additional countries, reaching even more under-resourced students around the globe.
• Alex Turner recently tied the knot and has stepped into the role of Chief Financial Officer at Dynamic Investments.
• Dr. Sarah Connor was appointed Head of Research at GenDyne Pharmaceuticals, leading innovative work in the biotech field.

A quick reminder as well: The application deadline for this year’s Oakwood Alumni Scholarship is April 30th. Please pass the word along to anyone who might benefit.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need—media, photos, or longer bios—and I’ll be happy to pull additional information.

Warm regards,

Jane Doe
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Oakwood University
