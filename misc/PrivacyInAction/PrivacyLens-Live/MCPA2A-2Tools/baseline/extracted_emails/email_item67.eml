1. Snapshot of International-Student Population 2024-25
• 287 active F-1 students | 14 active J-1 exchange scholars (as of 1 June 2025)
• Countries represented: 42 (largest cohorts: China 27 %, India 19 %, South Korea 8 %)
• 61 new F-1 admits expected for Fall 2025 – I-20s issued the week of 3 June

2. SEVIS Reporting & Enrollment Verification
• SEVIS Registration: 100 % of active records registered by the tenth class day each term; spring 2025 audit shows zero late registrations.
• Change of Address / Program Updates: average submission = 2.4 days (well under the 21-day federal limit).
• Weekly enrollment pulls flag any student < 12 credit hours; automated alert sent to student & advisor – no credit-load violations recorded this academic year.

3. Curricular & Optional Practical Training (CPT / OPT)
• CPT: 43 approvals AY 24-25; all documentation retained in Terra Dotta and mirrored in department archive. Zero cases of unauthorized employment.
• OPT: 81 initial OPTs, 29 STEM-OPT extensions. 100 % timely SEVIS updates of employer data within 10 days of changes.
• New policy (Feb 2025): mandatory pre-OPT workshop + quiz; completion rate 100 %.

4. Policy & Procedure Updates Since Last Review (May 2024)
• Advising Model – shifted to case-management approach (1 advisor per 120 students). Documented in “Compliance Meeting Notes,” Notion, 6 Feb 2025.
• Digital Consent Forms – all CPT/OPT requests now e-signed (DocuSign integration, launched Mar 2025).
• Emergency Communication Protocol – WhatsApp broadcast lists created for rapid contact during weather or immigration-related disruptions (pilot completed Apr 2025).

5. Advising & Orientation Practices
• New‐Student Orientation: 3-day hybrid programme covering immigration, academic integrity, and health insurance; attendance Spring 2025 cohort = 98 %.
• Ongoing Advising: students can book 30-min slots via Calendly; average wait time 1.7 days.
• Faculty Training: 2 workshops (Sept 2024, Jan 2025) on classroom implications of F-1 status; 56 faculty attendees / 94 % rated session “very useful.”

6. Compliance Metrics & Monitoring Tools
• Dashboard KPIs (updated weekly in Notion):

  – Average processing time for student requests: 2.1 business days (goal ≤ 3)
• Internal Audit (May 2025) found no record-keeping deficiencies; see “Compliance Meeting Notes” page for details.

7. Outstanding Issues / Planned Improvements
• Reinstatement case noted above – expected USCIS adjudication August 2025; interim plan in place to maintain academic progress.
• Visa Renewal Challenges: 7 students flagged for summer consular delays; department providing template support letters and remote course options (see Notion page “Visa Renewal Challenges,” 5 Jun 2025).
• Staff capacity – hiring adjunct compliance assistant (search closing 30 June). Target onboarding: 15 Aug.
• Migrating legacy paper files (2017–19 intakes) to digital archive by 1 September.
