Hi [Your Name],

Here’s a concise snapshot of where Project Falcon stands this week. Feel free to drop these bullets straight into the update for Sarah.

Major accomplishments
• Finalized design specifications for the new campaign assets (see “Project Falcon Update” e-mail, 10 Feb).  
• Completed the first round of digital-strategy testing; feedback from internal stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive.  
• Phase-2 marketing materials have been tested with focus groups and are being well received (see Notion page “Project Falcon – Phase 2 Update”).

Current blockers / risks
• Waiting on the consolidated stakeholder feedback pack before we lock the last creative edits (ETA: next Tuesday).  
• Social-media approach tweaks are still under discussion and will be finalized in the upcoming team meeting.  
• Resource allocation for video production is still being confirmed; the green-light is required before full rollout.

Upcoming milestones
• 15 Feb – Review session to integrate testing feedback and freeze the timeline.  
• 22 Feb – Final creative sign-off and asset hand-off to production.  
• 01 Mar – Full-rollout launch (pending production sign-off).

Quick references
• Notion: “Project Falcon Overview” & “Project Falcon – Phase 2 Update.”  
• Gmail threads: “Project Falcon Update” (10 Feb) and “Project Falcon – Next Steps” (20 Jan).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
John
