Dear Mr. Harrison,

Pursuant to your request and our ongoing collaboration with the Securities Oversight Commission, please find below the most recent versions of InnoTech Solutions’ key corporate compliance policy materials. These policies reflect the changes adopted following our latest internal audit cycle (completed May 2025) and align with the guidance previously discussed with your team.

1. Code of Business Conduct & Ethics  
   • Establishes standards for employee conduct, conflicts-of-interest, gifts & entertainment, political contributions, and insider-trading safeguards.  
   • Updated section 4.2 clarifies mandatory pre-clearance for all transactions involving SOC-regulated securities.

2. Data Privacy & Protection Policy  
   • Incorporates SOC-mandated encryption controls, expanded retention schedule (see Annex A), and breach-notification procedures.  
   • Appendix B (pp. 12-15) maps each control to SOC Rule 18-401.

3. Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy  
   • Reaffirmation of zero-tolerance stance, risk-based due-diligence checklist for third-party intermediaries, and new red-flag escalation matrix.  
   • Training completion rate: 100 % of relevant personnel as of 30 Apr 2025.

4. Whistleblower & Retaliation Protection Policy  
   • Describes secure reporting channels, investigative time-frames, and confidentiality safeguards.  
   • Section 3.1 aligns retaliation definitions with SOC Advisory Memo 22-07.

5. Third-Party Vendor Compliance Framework  
   • Outlines onboarding risk scoring, annual certification methodology, and continuous monitoring protocols.  
   • Exhibit C provides the current vendor-risk heat map.

6. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Policy  
   • Integrates SOC environmental reporting metrics and human-rights due-diligence requirements.  
   • KPI dashboard (pg. 8) benchmarked against industry medians.

7. Internal Audit & Monitoring Charter  
   • Defines audit universe, sampling methodology, and quarterly oversight reporting lines.  
   • Attachment 1 summarises Q1 2025 findings (no material exceptions).

Electronic copies (PDF) of each full policy, including referenced annexes and exhibits, have been placed in a secure shared folder. You will receive an automated email momentarily granting you direct download access (SOC-compliant encryption, read-only permissions). If you prefer physical copies or encounter any access issues, please let me know and I will make alternate arrangements immediately.

Should your review identify items that warrant clarification or supplemental data, I remain at your disposal to assist.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
