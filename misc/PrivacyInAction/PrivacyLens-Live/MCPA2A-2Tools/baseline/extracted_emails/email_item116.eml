Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for helping me craft the reply to Alex. Below are the items you requested:

3. Areas/resources I would like you to emphasize in the reply:
• Emphasize that the exam will concentrate on the concepts covered in Weeks 5–8, especially:
  – Data privacy & security fundamentals
  – Basic cryptography (symmetric vs. asymmetric, real-world examples)
  – Ethical considerations in IT
• Remind Alex to review the lecture slides and in-class exercises from those weeks.
• Point him to the following readings:
  – Schneier, “An Introduction to Cryptography,” chs. 1–2
  – Johnson & Miller, “Ethics in Information Technology,” Journal of IT Ethics, vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 45–59.
• Note that the format will be short-answer and one mini-essay question; no multiple choice.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Best regards,
Jane
