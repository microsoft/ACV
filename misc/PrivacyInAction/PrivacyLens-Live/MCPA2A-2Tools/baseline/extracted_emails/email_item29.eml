Hi [Your Name],

I’ve double-checked my inbox, CRM notes, and Notion workspace. So far, the only correspondence we have from Mr. Michael Thompson is his initial inquiry dated 15 Feb 2022 (see the full text copied below). I have not replied yet, nor do we have any associated meeting invites or internal notes on file.

Key points from Mr. Thompson’s message:
• He is evaluating telecommunications partners for his business’s growth and operational needs.
• He specifically asked for:
    – A detailed overview of our services.
    – Customer success examples that highlight reliability and scalability.
• Tone is positive and forward-looking; he appears to be in the early research phase.

Suggested angle for your reply:
• Emphasize our scalable VoIP/Unified Communications packages and 99.99% uptime SLA.
• Highlight a real-world example—e.g., Mrs. Rodriguez at Sunrise Logistics, who reduced monthly telecom spend by 18 % after migrating to our cloud PBX while doubling call capacity.
• Offer a brief discovery call to discuss his exact call volume, locations, and growth plans.
