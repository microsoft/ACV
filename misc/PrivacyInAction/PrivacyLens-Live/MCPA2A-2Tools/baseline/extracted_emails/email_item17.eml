Hello MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. As you prepare the next update of our scheduling and management system, we’d like to share a few key requirements and clarifications to ensure the new release fits our clinic’s operational needs:

1. Enhanced appointment-rescheduling workflow (allow drag-and-drop and automatic patient notification).
2. Real-time insurance eligibility check integrated into the patient intake form.
3. Customizable daily performance dashboard for clinicians (KPIs: appointments completed, no-shows, average visit length).
4. Expanded reporting filters for telehealth vs. in-person visits.
5. Two-factor authentication for all staff logins.

A detailed breakdown—including user stories, priority rankings, and desired timelines—is available in our shared Notion workspace ("System Update – Spring Release"). I’ve also forwarded a summary email thread from our providers to your contact@medtechsolutions.com inbox for additional context.

Could you please:
• Review the items above and in Notion,
• Let us know which features can be included in the upcoming release, and
• Provide an estimated development and rollout timeline?

If any requirement needs clarification, feel free to reach out by email or phone. We appreciate your partnership and look forward to your feedback.

Thank you very much for your time and support.

Best regards,

Jane
