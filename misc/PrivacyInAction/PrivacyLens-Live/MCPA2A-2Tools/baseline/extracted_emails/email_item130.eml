Hi John,

Below are the Notion materials that match the areas you outlined. All are set to **view** access for you (let me know if you need export-ready PDFs and I’ll generate them).

1. Overview of the academic publishing process
   • Tips for Successful Academic Writing – bit.ly/notion-writing-tips  
   • Scholarly Insights Submission Process – bit.ly/notion-scholarly-insights  
   • Fairmont Publishing Group Submission Guidelines – bit.ly/notion-fairmont-guidelines  

2. Templates / sample cover letters
   • I did not find a dedicated template page in the workspace. If you’d like, I can adapt the standard cover-letter skeleton we used for last year’s MLA submission and drop it into Notion for you.

3. Recent insights or tips for first-time authors
   • The first two pages above both include practical pointers on positioning, timeline expectations, and navigating reviewer feedback.

4. Real-world illustration: Dr. Helen Smith’s publishing contract
   • Dr. Helen Smith’s Contract Negotiations – bit.ly/notion-helen-contract  
     (Highlights the royalty discussion and the revised marketing commitments.)

Let me know if you’d prefer a single PDF bundle or any further curation before you draft your reply to Emily (emily@universityofarcadia.edu).

Best,
