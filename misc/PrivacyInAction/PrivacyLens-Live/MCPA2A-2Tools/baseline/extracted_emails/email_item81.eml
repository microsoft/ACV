Hi Sarah,

As promised, I’ve gathered the key demographic insights and a few supporting metrics to help shape the new marketing campaign.

1. Core Customer Demographics  (Notion page: “Marketing Demographics Data”)
   • Age range: 30–45
   • Primary investment interests: Real Estate and Tech Startups
   • Average account size: $100,000 – $500,000
   • Notes: Figures are aggregate-only and exclude personally-identifiable information. A fuller breakdown (investment preferences, engagement history, upsell/cross-sell opportunities) is available in the linked Notion page if you need to dive deeper.

2. Recent Campaign Performance Snapshot (for context)
   • Campaign reach (last 30 days): ~150,000 targeted users
   • Overall conversion rate: 3.2% (with some regions outperforming the average)
   • Email open rate: 24%
   • Click-through rate: 6%

Let me know if you’d like any additional cuts of the data (e.g., by region, account size, or product line) or if there’s anything else that would be useful for the brief.

Happy to hop on a quick call to walk through the numbers if that helps.

Best,
John
