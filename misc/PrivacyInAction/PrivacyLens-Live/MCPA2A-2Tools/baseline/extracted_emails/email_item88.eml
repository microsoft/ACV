Hi [Your Name],

Below are the items I could pull together for you. Let me know if you need anything else.

1. Donor-performance snapshot (last 12 months)
   • Most recent community-drive total: $3,000 from 5 individual donors (avg. gift $600; 2 repeat donors).
   • Recurring-giving segment grew approx. 10% year-over-year; average retention on recurring gifts is holding at 88%.
   • No formal PDF dashboard came in via email during the period, so I compiled the above from our internal tracker.

2. Notes from my last strategy meeting with Emily
   • Notion page link (no sensitive data): https://www.notion.so/Donation-Strategy-Meeting-Minutes-20f0dc8fa0db81468ae9c83ea0d887f9
   • Key takeaways: focus on recurring gifts, ramp up donor-recognition touches, test social-media "challenge" to attract younger supporters.

3. Upcoming campaign windows
   • Q3 match challenge: tentative launch the week of 8 July (exact sponsor confirmation pending).
   • Back-to-School supply drive: kicks off 19 Aug, runs 4 weeks.
   • If we want a late-year joint appeal, first planning check-in is penciled for 23 Oct.

4. Messaging / subject-line examples with strong lifts
   • “Thank You for Your Support – See the Impact You Made” – 58% open / 9% click → 18% higher gift rate than baseline.
   • “You Can Double Hope Today – Partner Match Ends at Midnight” – 51% open / 13% click.
   • “Join Our Community Champions – Monthly Giving Makes It Happen” – 47% open / 11% click, but 3× conversion to recurring.
   • You can see full copy in our shared folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/##/High-Performing-Appeals (let me know if access issues).

Anything marked confidential (e.g., itemized donor list in Notion) stays internal—I’ve only surfaced aggregate figures here. If you need deeper data for analysis, we can anonymize further or review in person.

Hope this helps you shape a tight, data-driven email to Emily.

Thanks!
John
