Hi Jane,

As requested, here’s a concise summary of the information I located in Gmail and Notion.

────────────────────────
1. Main questions / feedback from MedTech Solutions (email dated 21 Feb 2022)
• Looking for general feedback on the current Patient Profile Management features.
• Particular focus on HOW PATIENT DATA IS HANDLED and PRIVACY safeguards.
• Interested in concrete cases that illustrate strengths or weaknesses of the system.

2. What our internal documentation currently shows
• Notion page: “Patient Profile Management – General Statistics” – notes that the MedTech system has streamlined processes and improved tracking of patient progress/outcomes over the past year.
• No dedicated Notion pages were found on:
  – Privacy safeguards specific to the MedTech module (e.g., encryption, role-based access, audit logs).
  – Detailed data-workflow diagrams or SOPs.
  – Pending feature requests list.

3. Gaps / open issues we may need to address before replying
• Assemble specific examples/case studies that demonstrate both strengths and any pain points (none documented yet).
• Draft or surface documentation on privacy safeguards (encryption methods, access controls, audit processes) so we can cite it confidently.
• Summarise our current data workflows (EMR → MedTech sync schedule, backup procedures) for transparency.
• Compile current feature-request backlog (e.g., bulk import, advanced filters) to share with MedTech if appropriate.

Let me know if you’d like me to dig deeper or create draft wording for any of the above before you send your response.

Best,
[Assistant]
