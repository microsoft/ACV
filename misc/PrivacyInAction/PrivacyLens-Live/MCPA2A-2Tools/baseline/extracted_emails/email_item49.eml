Hi [Your Name],

Absolutely—happy to help.

1. Care-Log access
I’ve just granted you view-only access to the master Care Log (Google Sheet).  You should receive a separate Drive notification momentarily.  The most recent entries you’ll see include:
 • Emily Watson (Grade 4, epilepsy)
   – Last seizure: 5/10/25 at 10:22 AM in the nurse’s office; Diastat NOT administered.
   – Current classroom accommodations: seat near the door, water bottle allowed, option to rest in Health Room after PE, avoid strobe/flicker videos, send to me immediately if she reports aura/fatigue.

 • Jacob Rivera (Grade 5, Type 1 Diabetes)
   – 5/14/25 blood-glucose low (65 mg/dL) before lunch; treated with juice, recovered within 15 min.
   – Accommodations: snacks permitted anytime, BG checks at 10:00 AM & 1:30 PM, unrestricted restroom/water breaks.

 • Lily Chen (Grade 3, severe food allergies to peanuts & sesame)
   – EpiPen (exp 04/26) verified; no reactions since 3/1/25.
   – Reminder: All‐class cooking activity planned 5/20—ingredients list reviewed, safe to proceed.

2. Parent/physician communication
I am forwarding the following threads to you for full context:
   • 5/12 email from Dr Patel (Emily’s neurologist) confirming she may resume recess but should avoid contact sports until after her July EEG.
   • 5/13 email from Mrs Watson outlining Emily’s new seizure triggers and requesting that substitutes be briefed.

Please let me know if you need anything else or have trouble accessing the log.  Happy to jump on a quick call before tomorrow afternoon if that helps.

Thank you for pulling the staff message together—and for partnering to keep our students safe.

Best regards,
Jane [Last Name]
