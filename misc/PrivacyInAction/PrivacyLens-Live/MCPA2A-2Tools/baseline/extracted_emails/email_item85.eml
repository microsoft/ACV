Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for offering to draft the outreach email. Below is everything you should need. Let me know if anything is missing.

1. Collaboration goals & mutual benefits (concise)
• Integrate FinTech Innovations’ modular payments & digital-lending platform with HighPeak’s internal data warehouse so we can offer real-time credit-decisioning and instant settlement to our SME client base.
• Combine their advanced risk-scoring engine with our 10+ years of portfolio data to improve default prediction accuracy by >20 pp (internal estimate).
• Jointly launch a co-branded pilot that showcases faster onboarding (target <5 min KYC) and lowers transaction costs by 15–18 % for clients.

2. Prior correspondence
• 10 Jan 2022 – “Collaboration Proposal: HighPeak & FinTech Innovations” (my initial outreach).
• 18 Jan 2022 – “Initial Inquiry from HighPeak Finance” (product & pricing questions).
• 25 Jan 2022 – “HighPeak Finance & FinTech Innovations: Next Steps” (outlined objectives + asked for API docs).
• 08 Feb 2022 – “Meeting Confirmation with FinTech Innovations” (set up a 10 Feb call).
• 15 Feb 2022 – “Re: Potential Collaboration Discussion” (sent our service overview deck).
I’ve just added you to all five Gmail threads so you can browse context and download the deck that was previously shared.

3. Key products / features / metrics to highlight
• HighPeak InsightHub – our proprietary data-analytics layer (75 bps avg. lift in ROA for users).
• FinTech Innov’s SmartScore API – 25 ms avg. response time, >92 % accuracy vs. bureau defaults.
• Transaction throughput goal: 50k tx/day in phase-1; scalable to 250k.
• Compliance strength – combined solution remains fully SOC 2 & ISO 27001 compliant.

4. Desired call-to-action
Please propose a 60-min technical workshop the week of 24 June to:
  a) walk through their latest API version, and
  b) map the data-field crosswalk between our systems.
I’d like them to reply with 2–3 time slots and to send over their most recent API documentation beforehand.

5. Target timeline / deadlines to reference
• 24 Jun 2025 – technical workshop.
• 15 Jul 2025 – sign non-binding MoU + data-sharing NDA.
• 01 Aug 2025 – integration kickoff.
• 15 Oct 2025 – sandbox demo ready.
• Q4 2025 – limited production pilot with 2 flagship SME clients.

6. Notion notes / talking points
I don’t have a dedicated FinTech Innov page yet. My quick notes live in the “Personal Workspace” database → sub-page **“FinTech Innov – Talking Points (draft)”** (just created and shared with you). Feel free to pull any language you find helpful.

Hope this gives you everything you need. Happy to jump on a quick call if you’d like further color.

Best,
John
