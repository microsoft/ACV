Hi [Your Name],

Below is the consolidated material you asked for. Let me know if anything needs clarifying or if you’d like it in a different format.

——————————————————————————
1. End-to-End Dispute-Resolution Workflow

Step 0 – Intake Channel
• Customer submits a complaint/dispute via Online Banking secure form, 24-hr phone line, branch staff, or written correspondence.

Step 1 – Case Creation & Acknowledgment (Day 0–1)
• CRM auto-generates a unique case number.
• Acknowledgment e-mail/SMS is sent within 24 hrs confirming receipt, case number, and next steps.

Step 2 – Preliminary Review (Day 1–2)
• Front-line Disputes Desk (within Customer Care) verifies that the matter is within policy scope and obtains any missing documentation.
• Low-value/simple errors (≤$50) may be auto-credited at this point under the “fast-track” rule.

Step 3 – Investigation (Day 2–10*)
• Case is assigned to a Dispute Resolution Specialist (DRS).
• DRS contacts the merchant, card network or relevant internal ops team, compiles evidence, and analyses transaction logs.
• For card disputes, provisional credit is issued no later than Day 10 (Reg E/Reg Z requirement) unless the customer is found liable earlier.

Step 4 – Decision & Remediation (Typical Day 5–15; Reg-Z/Reg-E max 45–90 days)
• DRS drafts a determination memo (approve, partial approve, or deny) with supporting evidence.
• Compliance & Risk Control reviews any denial or high-value (>US$5k) approval.
• Remediation (credit, chargeback filing, merchant debit, fee reversals) is processed by Payments Ops.

Step 5 – Customer Notification (same day as decision)
• Outcome letter/email details the finding, amount credited/debited, and next steps.
• If denied, appeal instructions and external escalation contacts are provided.

Step 6 – Appeal / Ombuds (if requested, Day 15–30)
• Appeals routed to the Quality Assurance & Ombuds Office (independent of Customer Care).
• Fresh review within 15 calendar days; complex cases may be extended to 30 days with written notice.

Step 7 – Closure & Feedback Capture
• Case status changed to “Closed–Resolved” once funds have settled and any appeal window lapses.
• Post-resolution survey automatically triggered; responses feed continuous-improvement dashboard.

*Complex fraud cases that require merchant arbitration can run 30–45 days; regulatory cap is 90 days for cross-border or PINless debit transactions.

2. Service-Level Targets & Typical Timeframes
• Acknowledgment: ≤24 hrs (2024 YTD actual 99.4% within target)
• Provisional credit (card disputes): ≤10 days (avg 3.8 days)
• Investigation complete: ≤15 days for 85% of cases (2024 YTD 87.9%; mean 6.2 days)
• Final resolution: ≤45 days (card) / ≤15 days (ACH & internal transfers)
• Customer contact cadence: at least once every 5 business days on open cases longer than 10 days.

Escalation Points
• >US$5k, suspected AML/Fraud, or media-sensitive cases – escalated to Dispute Escalation Team Lead & Compliance Director.
• Regulatory or CFPB complaints – Compliance Risk Officer within 1 day.

——————————————————————————
3. Departments / Roles Involved
• Customer Care – Disputes Desk (intake, triage, customer comms)
• Dispute Resolution Specialists – Investigation & determination
• Payments Operations – Monetary adjustments, chargebacks
• Compliance & Risk Control – Policy adherence, regulatory filings
• Quality Assurance & Ombuds Office – Independent review/appeals
• Legal Counsel (as needed) – High-risk cases or threatened litigation

Customer Communication Touch-points

• Resolution letter with outcome explanation
• Appeal outcome (if invoked)

——————————————————————————
4. Recent Policy Updates / Improvements
• February 2024 – Introduced “Fast-Track Credit” for eligible disputes ≤US$50 (cuts average turnaround by 2.6 days).
• May 2024 – Added self-service dispute tracker in mobile app (real-time status; lifted call-volume load by 14%).
• July 2024 – Updated escalation matrix to include Compliance review for crypto-related card purchases.

——————————————————————————
5. Metrics & Anonymised Case Snapshots
• Overall resolution rate: 96.3% of disputes resolved in customer’s favour (partial or full) YTD.
• Average turnaround: 6.2 business days (card), 3.4 days (ACH).

Case A – “Glamour Gadgets” High-Value Charge (US$4,500)
• Intake → Decision: 11 days; customer fully reimbursed.
• Merchant provided no compelling evidence; chargeback filed through Visa; bank recovered funds within 35 days.
