Hi Jane,

Below is a concise roll-up of everything new I could find in your Gmail threads and Notion workspace since last week.

• Notion – “Project Codebase v2.3” (created 11-Jun-2025)
  – Fixes applied to the transaction-processing module.
  – Added stronger data-storage encryption.
  – Status: pushed to main; awaiting peer review and integration testing.

• Notion – “Project Sync Meeting Notes” (added 11-Jun-2025)
  – Decision: move ahead with the new encryption algorithm for Global Investments Inc.
  – New tasks:
    • Mark – Implement client-side encryption logic.
    • Jane – Debug shareholder-data encryption issues.
  – Target completion date for both items: 20-Jun-2025.

• Gmail – No project-related emails have been received in the past seven days. (Last matching thread predates this window.)

Upcoming dates & milestones
• 20-Jun-2025 – Deadline for encryption debugging & client-side implementation.
• Late next week (TBD) – Integration-testing window once Codebase v2.3 is reviewed.

Let me know if you need any deeper dive or supporting links.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
