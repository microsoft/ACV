Hi [Your Name],

Below is the latest snapshot of my active projects pulled from my Notion workspace. Let me know if you need anything else.

• Helena Blythe – “Whispers of the Past”
  – Current status: FINAL EDIT COMPLETE (delivered 11 Jun)
  – Recent milestones: developmental feedback incorporated; line-by-line polish finished; author approval received.
  – Blockers: none.
  – Next steps: compile style sheet & editorial summary for marketing (ETA 20 Jun); remain on call for minor author/publisher queries.
  – Support needed: none at this time.

That’s the only active title on my desk this week after wrapping two smaller copy-proof jobs on Monday; new manuscripts are expected in next week’s intake.

Please feel free to tweak wording for Mr. Griffin’s report. Happy to elaborate if required.

Thanks,
John
