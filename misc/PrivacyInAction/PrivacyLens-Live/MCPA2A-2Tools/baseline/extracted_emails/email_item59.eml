Dear Hope and Healing Foundation Team,

I hope you are well. On behalf of New Horizons Recovery Center, I am writing to request additional support for our expanding community–outreach initiatives. Over the past year, your generous grants have enabled us to:

• Increase the number of weekly mobile-clinic visits from 2 to 5, serving more than 300 individuals.
• Launch a peer-mentorship program that now pairs 45 participants with volunteer mentors.
• Provide overdose-response training and naloxone kits to 120 family members and community allies.

Building on these successes, we are preparing to:

1. Add two new mobile-clinic routes to reach rural areas that currently lack any addiction-recovery resources.
2. Extend our peer-mentorship program to include job-readiness workshops and employer partnerships.
3. Host quarterly “Community Recovery Days” that combine health screenings, family counseling, and educational seminars in underserved neighborhoods.

To accomplish these goals, we are seeking an additional $75,000 in program funding for the upcoming fiscal year. A detailed budget, projected impact metrics, and implementation timeline are available in our “Outreach Expansion 2025” workspace on Notion (accessible via the link previously shared with your grants team).

We would be grateful if you could:

• Review the Notion materials at your convenience.
• Let us know whether any further documentation or clarifications are needed.
• Share the anticipated timeline for decisions regarding supplemental funding requests this cycle.

Thank you for your continued partnership and for considering this proposal. We deeply appreciate the Hope and Healing Foundation’s commitment to empowering recovery communities like ours.

Warm regards,

John [Last Name]
Coordinator, New Horizons Recovery Center
