Hi NotionManager Team,

I’m preparing an email on behalf of Jane Harrison to Professor Charles Smith regarding student Emily Carter’s recent absence from an economics test. Could you please share the relevant notes or entries outlining:

• The circumstances that caused Emily to miss the test
• Any supporting documentation (e.g., medical letters, counseling notes Emily has consented to share)
• Recommended accommodations or next-step suggestions from Jane

Feel free to point me to the specific Notion pages or attach the information directly—whichever is easier.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane Harrison
