Hi Ethan,

Great to hear from you! Below is the direct link to the full cover-design brief for Clara Bellamy’s “Whispers of the Past,” along with the supporting reference materials (synopsis, author bio, specs, colour palette, etc.). Everything is housed in a single Notion page so you can view or download items as needed.

If anything in the brief isn’t clear, or if you’d prefer the assets in a different format, just let me know and I’ll send them right over.

Looking forward to seeing your initial concepts!

Best regards,
