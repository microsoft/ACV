Hi Alex,

Thanks for laying out the requirements so clearly. I can confirm that we’ll prepare the five data sets – Customer Profile, Monthly Transaction Summary, Digital Channel Usage, Customer Service Interactions, and Account Status & Balances – using the standard SHA-256 hashed Customer_ID and excluding all direct identifiers.

Field-definition updates since January 2025
• Digital Channel Usage – The “device_type” field’s valid values list was expanded in March to include “Smart TV” (rare <0.2% of logins).  
• Customer Service Interactions – A new “channel” value, “Social Media DM,” was introduced in February when our social-care team went live.  
• No other columns have changed in name or data type; length limits and nullability are unchanged.

Deliverables & schedule
• Extract coverage: January 2024 – April 2025 (monthly granularity). Let me know if you need a different window.  
• Format: gzip-compressed CSVs following the Wave 3 file-naming convention plus an updated data dictionary (PDF & markdown) noting the two changes above.  
• Delivery: I’ll post everything to /utb_to_mmi by Thursday, 9 May, close of business, to give you an extra day of buffer.

Next steps
I’ll run a small sample early next week and verify row/column counts against the specs. If anything looks off I’ll let you know right away.

If you’d like to hop on a quick call to review the device_type or channel additions, just send over a couple of time slots.

Thanks, and talk soon!

Best,
