Hello Sunny Days Families,

I hope you’re all doing well! I’ve just finished drafting our latest “School Life” update, packed with photos, project highlights, and a look ahead to next week’s plans. Could you please:

1. Take a few minutes to read the update in Notion (link below).
2. Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or fun stories from home that you’d like me to include in the final version by this Friday at noon.

Your feedback helps me make these recaps as useful—and fun!—as possible. Thank you for your time, and for all you do to support our little learners.

Warmly,
Jane
Lead Teacher, Sunny Days Childcare Center
