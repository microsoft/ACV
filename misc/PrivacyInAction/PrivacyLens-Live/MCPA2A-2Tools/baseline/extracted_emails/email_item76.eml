Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise snapshot of where we stand on the investment-strategy presentation:

Completed
• Slide outline and story flow locked.
• Latest market-analysis data pulled and preliminary charts inserted.
• New portfolio-optimization algorithm integrated into the demo model; final test cycle in progress.

Pending / In-Progress
• Your review of the market-trends section and any content tweaks.
• QA team’s sign-off on the algorithm integration (ETA: tomorrow EOD).
• Design polish on three data-visualization slides.

Next Steps
1. Incorporate your edits and finalize narrative (Friday, 5 p.m.).
2. Complete QA sign-off and update results slide (Friday).
3. Final slide-design pass and consistency check (Saturday morning).
4. Internal dry-run rehearsal – Monday, 10 a.m.
5. Deliver finished deck to leadership for approval – Tuesday, noon.

Let me know if anything looks off or if you need additional info.

Thanks for keeping us on track!

Best,
John
