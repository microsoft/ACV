Hi Sarah,

Hope you’re well. As promised, here’s an overview of how the Titans are gearing up for the upcoming championship. Feel free to pull anything that helps round out your piece.

Training Focus Areas
• Two-a-day sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays centred on endurance (interval runs, VO₂-max circuits) and compound strength work.
• Thursday and Friday practices pivot to tactical execution – full-speed walk-throughs of set-piece variations and small-sided games to sharpen on-field chemistry.
• Daily recovery block: contrast baths, mobility work, and a 15-minute mindfulness routine we added this season to keep players mentally fresh.

Player Readiness & Health
• Squad is largely injury-free. Winger Mike Henderson is on a tailored hamstring-rehab plan with daily physiotherapy, targeted nutrition, and a gradual return to drills; we expect him available before the final roster is locked.
• GPS data show a 6 % uptick in high-speed meters across the starting XI since preseason camp (beating our 5 % target).

Behind-the-Scenes Adjustments
• Added a controlled-environment scrimmage against the academy squad with simulated crowd-noise to sharpen decision-making under pressure.
• Nutrition team switched pre-session fueling from oatmeal to beetroot-based smoothie shots to boost nitrate levels and endurance.
• Leadership group now meets nightly for 10-minute retros, ensuring key messages remain athlete-driven.

Let me know if you’d like deeper metrics, player quotes, or anything else.

Best,
John
