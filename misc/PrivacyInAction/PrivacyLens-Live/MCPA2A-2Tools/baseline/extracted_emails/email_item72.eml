Hello NotionManager Team,

I hope you’re doing well. Could you please send me the most up-to-date information about the upcoming Helping Hands Foundation charity gala—specifically the final:

• Date and start/end time
• Venue (including full address)
• Detailed program schedule (key timings, entertainment, auction, dinner, award ceremony, etc.)
• Dress code
• Confirmed speakers (including Mr. Thomas Anderson)
• Sponsorship highlights and recognition tiers
• RSVP instructions and primary contact details

I’m preparing a summary email for Mark Johnson and would like to ensure everything we share is accurate and complete.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane Smith
Branch Manager | Trustworthy Financial Group
