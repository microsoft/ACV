Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’ve been keeping well and enjoying your well-deserved retirement.

I’m writing to share an update on the Heathrow Terminal 5 expansion project I’m currently leading and, more importantly, to ask for your valued thoughts. Your mentorship was instrumental earlier in my career, and I would greatly appreciate any perspectives or cautions you might offer as we move into the next design phase.

To spare you an overflowing inbox, I’ve consolidated a concise project brief, key drawings, and our current risk-mitigation plan in my Notion workspace:

Heathrow T5 Expansion | Executive Brief

(Please let me know if the link gives you any trouble.)

If possible, could you let me know your availability over the next two weeks for a short call or to exchange comments via email? Even a few high-level observations would be immensely helpful.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing your wisdom once again.

Warm regards,

Jane
