Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out and for shining a light on the realities faced by undocumented neighbors in our city. Below is a concise overview drawn from our program reports and recent conversations within Harmony Alliance. I have removed any personally identifying details but can facilitate follow-up introductions (with permission) if you’d like to quote individuals directly.

1. Most Pressing Challenges
   • Constant fear of detention & family separation – especially after the two most recent ICE sweeps (Feb 2024 and Oct 2023) in the metro area.
   • Limited access to affordable healthcare – many families rely on free monthly clinics; ER visits are delayed until crises become acute.
   • Barriers to education – lack of state tuition aid means high-school graduates often forgo college; children of mixed-status households have higher absenteeism rates when parents are detained.
   • Workplace exploitation – cash-only jobs with below-minimum wages and unsafe conditions; reluctance to report violations for fear of retaliation.
   • Food insecurity – 48 % of clients in our intake survey reported skipping meals so children can eat.
   • Mental-health strain – high rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD linked to the migration journey and daily uncertainty.

2. Snapshot Data (Jan–May 2025)
   • Nourish Neighbors food-drive: 50+ families served monthly; 1,200 lbs of produce distributed in May alone.
   • Legal-aid clinic: 37 consultations; 19 referrals to pro-bono attorneys; wait-list currently at 23 cases.
   • Mutual-aid emergency fund: $8,350 disbursed (average $275 per family) for rent & medical bills.

3. Composite Personal Stories (names changed)
   • "Maria" – Fled cartel violence in 2022; works two housekeeping jobs. Turned away from subsidized housing due to documentation gaps and now pays 65 % of income on rent. 
   • "John" – Father of two U.S.-born children. Primary bread-winner was detained for three weeks during the Oct 2023 sweep. Children exhibit regression symptoms; family now relies on our weekly food pantry.
   • "Li" – Graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA this spring but ineligible for state scholarship programs. Deferred college dreams; volunteers at our after-school tutoring center while exploring private-scholarship options.

4. Community Resilience & Initiatives
   • Grass-roots child-care exchange has freed 15 parents to pursue steady work.
   • Informal ride-sharing network ensures safe transportation to medical appointments without risking immigration-checkpoint exposure.
   • Monthly "Know Your Rights" workshops (avg. 28 attendees) equip residents to respond calmly during enforcement actions.

5. Suggested Sources & Context
   • Local census-tract data show foreign-born population growth of 6 % since 2020; yet city translation services budget remained flat.
   • The state’s pending "Safe Communities Act" would restrict local-police collaboration with federal immigration enforcement—stakeholders are watching closely.

Please let me know if you need deeper statistics, policy references, or anonymized quotes. I can also arrange off-the-record conversations with community members who have expressed interest in sharing their experiences publicly.

I’m glad to support your reporting and appreciate your sensitivity to protecting vulnerable voices.

Warm regards,
