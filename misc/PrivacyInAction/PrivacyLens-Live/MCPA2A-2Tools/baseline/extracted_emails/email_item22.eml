--------------------------------------------
Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently working on a case that has some procedural similarities to the ones you've expertly handled at Carter & Goldstein. Without going into the specifics of our clients or their cases, I was wondering if you could share some general insights on the approach to motion filing and any strategic advice you might have.

I understand the need for discretion, so I'm only looking for procedural guidance that would be applicable in a broad sense, not tied to any particular case or client.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to your valuable input.

Best regards,
Mark
