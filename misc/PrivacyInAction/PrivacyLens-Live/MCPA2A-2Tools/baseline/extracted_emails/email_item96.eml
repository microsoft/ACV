Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for reaching out. Please find below the information your engineering team will need for the upcoming biometric-scanner deployment at Heathrow T-5.

1. Technical specifications & design drawings
• Model: BioScan X200 facial-recognition kiosk
• Dimensions: 440 mm W × 260 mm D × 1380 mm H
• Operating temp: ‑10 °C – 50 °C | IP-54
• Embedded OS: Hardened Linux 5.15 LTS
• Encryption: AES-256 on-device; TLS 1.3 for data-in-transit
• Drawings (PDF & DWG) – link below.
  → Notion: https://www.notion.so/Biometric-Scanner-Technical-Specifications-20f0dc8fa0db811e945cfd776c847bed
  → Notion: "Heathrow T5 – BioScan Layout v3" (floor-by-floor drawings)

2. Network & power requirements (per kiosk)
• Network: 1× GbE RJ-45 (PoE+ 802.3at, 25.5 W max)
  – VLAN 310 – Security Devices
  – Static IP block reserved: 10.20.35.80/28
  – Outbound ports: 443 (TLS) to 10.50.12.0/24 (AeroSecure) & *.bioscan.cloud
• Power (if PoE not used): 110–240 VAC, 50 Hz, 0.8 A (IEC C14 inlet)
• UPS: minimum 5 min ride-through required by HAL standard.

Location-specific cable pulls are noted in the layout drawings; let me know if you need the CAD layers broken out.

3. System access & onboarding
• AeroSecure portal: https://portal.aerosecure.io (Prod-UK)
• I will generate individual service-engineer accounts (role: “Installer – limited”) and share temporary passwords via our secure vault (LastPass) on Friday. Please send the first/last names and work emails for anyone who will need access.
• Default device password (“Secure*987”) is only for initial imaging; it must be rotated during commissioning. A checklist is included in the Installation guide (Section 3.2).

4. Project timeline / milestones
• 08 Jul – Site survey & final cable-tray sign-off
• 19 Jul – Hardware arrives Heathrow T-5 storage
• 01–18 Aug – Physical install (night shifts 22:00-05:00)
• 19–24 Aug – Integrated testing with HAL IT & Border Force
• 26 Aug – Contingency / punch-list
• 29 Aug – Go-live & hand-over
A detailed Gantt is in Notion under “Biometric Deployment Schedule v2”.

5. Documentation repository
All current docs live in the Notion space > Heathrow > Security Upgrade > Biometric X200. Start with:
• Tech Specs (link above)
• Installation Guide (PDF inside Tech Specs page)
• Deployment Schedule v2 (Gantt)
• Risk Register & Method Statement

6. Calendar / site access
The night-shift installation window (01–18 Aug, 22:00-05:00) is on the shared project calendar – you should already have a Google invite titled “T5 BioScan – Install Window”. If anyone on your team is missing it, let me know and I’ll re-invite.
HAL Security badges: submit engineer details (name, DOB, nationality) by 12 Jul so we can request temporary airside passes.

Please review and let me know if anything is unclear or if your team needs additional data. Looking forward to working together.
