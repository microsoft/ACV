Hi Alex,

Thank you for your hard work on the recent course project. I’ve had a chance to read it carefully and wanted to share some detailed feedback to guide your revisions and future projects.

Key strengths
• Solid understanding of the core course concepts—you applied the theoretical frameworks accurately and consistently.
• Data analysis is well-executed; your choice of methods suits your research question and the results are clearly explained.
• Visualizations are effective and enhance the reader’s grasp of your findings.
• Overall presentation is clear and well-organized, making the argument easy to follow.

Areas for improvement
• Hypothesis focus – While you identify an interesting question, the hypothesis could be stated more concisely and explicitly. A sharper hypothesis will give the paper a clearer sense of purpose from the outset.
• Research question alignment – Tighten the wording so the research question, hypothesis, and analysis line up seamlessly. At times they feel slightly broader than the actual analyses you conducted.
• Contextual framing – Add a few sentences that connect your findings back to the broader literature to underscore why your results matter.

Next steps
1. Rewrite the hypothesis in one or two precise sentences, making sure every section of the paper speaks directly to it.
2. Revisit the introduction and discussion to strengthen the link between your results and existing studies.
3. Give the revised draft a final proof-read for concise language and smooth transitions.

Overall assessment: B+

If you’d like to go over any of these points in more detail, feel free to send follow-up questions or stop by office hours (Tuesday 2–4 PM or by appointment). I’m happy to help you refine this work further.

Best regards,
Professor Jane
