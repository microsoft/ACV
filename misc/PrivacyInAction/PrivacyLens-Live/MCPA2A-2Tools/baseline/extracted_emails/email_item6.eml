Hi team,

Below is a consolidated snapshot of everything we currently have that’s relevant to the potential partnership with InnovateNow.  Let me know if I’ve missed anything.

────────────────────────────
NOTION CONTENT
────────────────────────────
• Industry Trends Presentation  (Notion link: https://www.notion.so/Industry-Trends-Presentation-20f0dc8fa0db81db90b6e403f91cf387)
  – External-share-safe deck covering macro trends, customer-centric product development, and examples of cross-company collaborations.
  – Could help frame “why now?” for a TechSolutions–InnovateNow partnership.

• TechSolutions Strategic Plan 2022  (Notion link: https://www.notion.so/TechSolutions-Strategic-Plan-2022-20f0dc8fa0db814496acfc05f88101bf)
  – Internal-only; contains confidential expansion initiatives (Asia entry, ML analytics investment, increased online presence).
  – Use as background when crafting our response but DO NOT share externally.

• No other pages mention InnovateNow specifically, and no brainstorm docs on collaboration ideas with them exist yet.

GMAIL THREADS WITH INNOVATENOW
────────────────────────────
• 21 Feb 2022 – Subject: “Exploring Collaboration Opportunities” from Emily Stone (emily@innovatenow.com)
  – Key asks: overview of TechSolutions’ market-expansion strategy & technology roadmap; Emily wants to understand mutual benefits.
  – No explicit timelines or pain points stated; appears to be an opening outreach.

• No additional emails from Emily or other InnovateNow contacts in our mailbox.

INTERNAL SUPPORTING MATERIAL
────────────────────────────
• One-Pager / Metrics – None found titled for InnovateNow. We may need to spin up a quick data sheet on:
  – Market overlap (size of segments both companies serve).
  – Integration feasibility (API compatibility, estimated engineering lift).
  – Projected ROI (revenue lift from cross-selling, cost savings via shared R&D).

Action items / next steps:
1. If anyone has separate notes or decks on InnovateNow that weren’t stored in Notion, please forward them to me today.
2. I’ll draft the reply to Emily referencing our strategic alignment and proposing a discovery call; deadline COB today so we can send tomorrow morning.
3. Marco (Finance) – can you pull rough TAM overlap and high-level ROI scenarios?
4. Priya (Product) – need a quick assessment of integration lift (~engineering weeks) based on their public API docs.

Thanks all—let’s aim to finalize the response draft by 10 AM tomorrow so John can review before sending.

Best,
John
