Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m excited to work together on a partnership that will better support families affected by disasters.

I’ve just granted you view-only access to the two Notion pages that capture our current thinking:

1. SecureNow Insurance and Community Engagement – a detailed proposal for a joint initiative with Helping Hands, including objectives, success metrics, and a draft framework for collaboration.
2. Partnership Opportunities – high-level notes from recent meetings with local businesses outlining sponsorship tiers and co-marketing ideas that could translate well to our work together.

Key highlights you’ll see inside:
• Objectives: combine SecureNow’s resources with Helping Hands’ on-the-ground expertise to deliver fast, comprehensive relief for disaster-impacted families.
• Proposed collaboration ideas: 
  – Joint Disaster Relief Fund (seeded by SecureNow, distributed by Helping Hands)
  – Community Preparedness Workshops co-hosted by both teams
  – Matching-donation campaign tied to SecureNow policy renewals
  – Employee volunteer program and skills-based mentoring
• Points I’d like the final email to cover: shared mission alignment, a concise overview of the initiatives above, and a call to schedule a planning session the week of July 8.

Please feel free to leave comments or suggest revisions directly in Notion. If you run into any access issues or need additional details, just let me know.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
Jane Smith
