Hey Jane,

Hope you're doing well! As you might know, Alex's birthday is coming up next week, and we're planning a little surprise for him. Given your close friendship with Alex, I thought you might help us with some details. Could you provide any relevant information?

Thanks a lot!
Mark

Additional details:

1. Alex’s schedule
   • Birthday: March 1st (falls on a Tuesday this year)
   • Regular days off-duty: Tuesday & Thursday (helpful for choosing a date)

2. Address
   • 742 Evergreen Terrace (his home; small back-yard that could hold ±20 people if needed)

3. Guest list (initial draft)
   • Close friends: Jane (me), Emily, Carlos, Mia
   • Metro City PD colleagues: Mark, Sgt. Lewis, Officer Chen, Officer Patel
   • Family: His sister Laura (lives nearby), mom & dad via Zoom if we set up a laptop
   (Happy to revise or expand—just let me know.)

4. Gift ideas / special preferences
   • Considering a rugged smartwatch built for first responders (GPS, heart-rate monitor, discreet notifications).
   • Alex is a huge fan of Italian food—favorite dish is classic lasagna—and enjoys board-game nights (Catan, Ticket to Ride).
   • He’d appreciate something low-key and relaxed rather than flashy.

Let me know if you need anything else or if these details spark more questions. Once you’ve put together the reply to Mark, I’m happy to review or send it on.

Thanks!
Jane
