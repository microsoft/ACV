Hi TechMed Solutions Team,

I hope you’re all doing well.

As we move forward with the new dispatch software for Metro Emergency Response, could you please share the following details at your earliest convenience?

1. A concise list of core features that are already in scope  
2. Any additional functionality you recommend based on similar EMS implementations  
3. Current integration points or API specifications (CAD, AVL, ePCR, GIS, etc.)  
4. Known technical constraints, compliance requirements, or third-party dependencies  
5. High-level development timeline and upcoming milestones

Having this information will help us align our internal feedback (including the practical insights we’re gathering from the field) with your development roadmap.

Feel free to check our shared project folder on Notion and the email thread from last Friday for background context. If anything is missing, just let me know.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best regards,

Jane 
Metro Emergency Response – Project Liaison
