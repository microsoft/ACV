Hi [Your Name],

Here’s the most up-to-date information I could locate for our shared caseload, focusing on Tom:

Gmail threads
• I did not find any new lab results, appointment summaries, or provider notes for Tom in the last 30 days.
• The most recent provider-related message mentioning Tom is from 8 Feb 2022 ("Re: Resources for Post-Operative Care") in which we discussed practical supports – no clinical updates since then.

Notion
• Page: Tom’s Recovery Journey (last edited 11 Jun 2025)
  – Pain & Mobility: Tom continues to experience notable post-operative pain that limits mobility, but he’s working through prescribed home exercises.
  – Community Support: He has been attending the “Healing Together” support group regularly and reports it has been very helpful.
  – Resources: He remains grateful for Helping Hands Foundation resources (adaptive equipment, meal deliveries) that are aiding recovery.
  – Pending Needs: ongoing pain-management review at next PCP visit; possible referral to home physical therapy once pain is better controlled.

At this point, there are no additional labs or specialist notes waiting to be filed. I’ll keep monitoring the inbox and will forward anything new as soon as it arrives.

Let me know if you need further detail or want me to follow up on anything else before you compile the report for Alex.

Thanks!

Jane
