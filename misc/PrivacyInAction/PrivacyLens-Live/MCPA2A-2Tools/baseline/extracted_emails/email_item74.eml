Hi [Your Name],

Below is a concise recap of the most recent information I could gather from both Gmail threads and our shared Notion workspace:

• Milestone / Meeting Takeaways
  – Completed installation of the new facial-recognition software on the security servers; initial tests show ~15 % improvement in recognition accuracy.
  – Q2 traffic-flow data capture finished; raw dataset was forwarded to Alex last week for preliminary analysis.

• Security-System Data / Design Adjustments
  – Main security server (SRV-192) has been moved to a segregated subnet (172.16.254.x) to reduce latency and increase resilience.
  – Facial-recognition module now integrated with the central credential database.
  – Next maintenance window pencilled in for 28 June to rotate credentials and deploy patch v3.2 (credentials will be shared securely at that time).

• Key Decisions, Dates & Next Steps
  – Week of 24 June: Analyse the full traffic-flow dataset and feed into the efficiency-model revisions.
  – 28 June: Apply security patch & credential rotation on SRV-192.
  – 05 July: Circulate first draft of bottleneck-alleviation recommendations for internal review.
  – Mid-July: Target date to submit joint paper outline to the Global Airport Design Consortium.

I did a sweep of our Gmail threads and didn’t see any newer milestone emails beyond these items.

Let me know if you’d like me to tag you directly on the relevant Notion pages or if anything else would be helpful.

Best regards,
Jane
