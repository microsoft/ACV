Hi Mark,

I’ve just finished gathering everything you asked for and uploaded the files to our shared Notion space:
SkyHigh Tower → External Resources

• Runway_Load_Distribution_Charts_v2.pdf – updated wheel-load envelopes and gear-configuration diagrams (covers ICAO Code F to regional jet categories). 
• Composite_Decking_System_Ref_Spec_2025.pdf – material properties, shear-stud patterns, fire-rating tables, and installation tolerances for the 76 mm profile we’re using on the concourses.
• Lateral_Load_Path_Coord_Checklist.docx – the quick-reference checklist our airside team uses to confirm diaphragm continuity, collector alignment, and tie-in to the tower’s outrigger trusses.

All three are in the top of the folder so they’re easy to spot. Let me know if you have any trouble accessing them—happy to email a copy directly.

If there are any particular load cases you’d like sanity-checked (e.g., the A380 dual tandem in flotation mode), just send over your calc sheets and I’ll run a cross-check.

Talk soon,
Jane
