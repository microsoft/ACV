Hi Emily,

I’ve pulled together the latest curriculum-effectiveness information from our shared Notion workspace.  You should now have viewer access to the two pages listed below (let me know if you run into any permission issues):

• Curriculum Effectiveness Analysis – https://www.notion.so/Curriculum-Effectiveness-Analysis-20f0dc8fa0db815a8a78cb3b0b1f205b
• Student Feedback on Curriculum – https://www.notion.so/Student-Feedback-on-Curriculum-20f0dc8fa0db819da42cef947d72e0f2

Quick outline of the key points
--------------------------------
1. Student-outcome metrics
   • Overall course-wide average grade rose by 12 % this semester under the revised curriculum.
   • Early-alert risk list dropped from 15 students last term to 7 this term.
   • Pass rate improved from 88 % to 94 %.

2. Assessment results snapshot (examples – full table is on the Notion page)
   • Aaliyah Green – A (excellent critical-thinking work on the capstone project)
   • Ethan Hernandez – B+ (solid mastery; needs more classroom engagement)
   • Zoe Patel – A- (strong analytics; could contribute more in discussions)
   • Liam Wang – B (good fundamentals; benefitted from extra tutoring)
   • Olivia Johnson – A (outstanding across all modules)

3. Feedback summary (from 42 student responses)
   • What’s working: practical, hands-on projects; real-world case studies; balance of theory and application.
   • Areas for enhancement: more scaffolding for the advanced statistics/analytics modules; additional review sessions before exams; increased interactive workshops.

4. Notes & Next Steps
   • I’m drafting a brief action plan to address the advanced-module support gap (target completion: next Friday).
   • Please let me know if Bright Futures needs the raw CSV grade export or any visualisations for your presentation—happy to generate those.

Feel free to drop any follow-up questions or data requests my way.

Best,
John
