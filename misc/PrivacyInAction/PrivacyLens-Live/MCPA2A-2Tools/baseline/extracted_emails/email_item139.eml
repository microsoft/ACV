Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for flagging Carlos’s request. Below is a concise rundown of the most significant federal immigration developments since our last community brief. I will prepare a community-friendly one-pager for Carlos and the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance once you confirm nothing else is needed.

1. Skilled-Worker Visa Quota Expansion  
   • Public Law 118-142 ("Immigration Reform & Workforce Skills Act"): raises the annual employment-based visa cap from 140,000 to 200,000 starting 1 July 2025, with a 15 percent set-aside for STEM graduates and critical-health-care occupations.  
   • USCIS will open the FY-2026 registration window on 15 June; I will circulate a filing checklist next week.

2. New Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Designation  
   • DHS designated Belovia for an 18-month TPS period (86 Fed. Reg. 31572).  
   • Applications open 20 June 2025; initial window closes 20 December 2025. We should alert affected clients to gather identity and entry documentation now.

3. Family Reunification Parole (FRP) Pilot  
   • Announced 4 May: eligible beneficiaries of approved I-130 petitions from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador may request advance travel authorization while awaiting visa availability.  
   • USCIS will issue invitations case-by-case; we should help community members watch their mail for Form I-797C notices.

4. Fee Schedule Changes  
   • Final USCIS fee rule takes effect 1 Aug 2025; most forms increase ~20 %, e.g., N-400 rises to $760.  
   • Sliding-scale discounts added for household incomes ≤200 % FPL; we can help eligible applicants compile fee-waiver evidence.

5. DACA Litigation Update  
   • 30 May 2025 Fifth Circuit decision upholds work-authorization portion of the DACA Preservation Rule. Renewals continue without interruption; new initial filings remain on hold pending district-court review.

6. Public-Charge Final Rule Confirmation  
   • DHS’s December 2024 rule, which excludes most non-cash benefits (Medicaid, SNAP, housing vouchers) from public-charge determinations, survived a recent court challenge on 12 April. No change to current practice.

Resource: A brief titled "Recent Immigration Law Changes" is in our Notion space; content mirrored from The Advocate’s Ledger. I’ll attach the full Ledger excerpt once this month’s edition is released (expected Friday).

Please let me know if Carlos would like any of the above translated into Spanish or if he needs deeper dives on particular points.

Best,
Jane
