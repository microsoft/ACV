Hi NotionManager Team,

I’m preparing an introductory email for Lisa, Ethan’s prospective caregiver, and I’d like to make sure I’m sharing the most accurate, up-to-date information. Could you please pull the following items from our Notion workspace (Ethan Care):

• Daily routine (wake-up/bedtime, meal times, hygiene, naps)
• Preferred foods, snacks, and any dietary restrictions
• Favorite activities, toys, or motivators
• Communication style and helpful prompts/keywords
• Current therapy schedule (OT, PT, speech) and latest progress notes
• Known triggers, calming strategies, and safety considerations
• Any visual schedules, charts, or reference documents that would be useful for a new caregiver

A concise summary (bullet points are fine) plus links or attachments to the relevant Notion pages would be perfect.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Jane
