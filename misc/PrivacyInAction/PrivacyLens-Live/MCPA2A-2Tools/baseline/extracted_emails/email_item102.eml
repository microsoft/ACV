Hi team,

As part of prepping our marketing collateral for the upcoming product launch, I’m consolidating background materials for our freelance designer, Alex.

Could you please drop the following items (or links/locations) in the "New Product Launch" Notion workspace or reply with them directly by today 5 PM so we can get everything to Alex tomorrow morning?

• Latest product overview deck and one-page summary
• Brand guidelines (logo files, color palette, typography)
• Key messaging / positioning statements
• Target customer personas and market research highlights
• Launch timeline with major milestones and critical deadlines
• Any existing creative assets/mood boards
• Internal reviewer list or approval flow for creative materials

If any of the above already lives in a shared drive, Notion page, or a previous email thread, feel free to just send me the link.

Thanks a ton for the quick turnaround!

Best,
Jane
