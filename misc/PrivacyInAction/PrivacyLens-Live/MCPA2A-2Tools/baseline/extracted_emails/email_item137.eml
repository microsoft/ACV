Hi Alex,

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to provide background before you finalize your piece. Below is a condensed overview, followed by links to two internal briefing pages you’re welcome to mine for additional detail.

1.  Standard CPS Workflow at Haven (high level)
   •  Intake – Our 24/7 hotline or law-enforcement partner logs a referral. Basic safety triage is completed within 2 hours.
   •  Screening/Priority Coding – Within 24 hours the on-call supervisor reviews historical contacts and assigns a response category (P1 = 0–24 hrs, P2 = 24–72 hrs, Differential Response = 3–5 days).
   •  Initial Contact & Safety Assessment – Field worker conducts home/placement visit, interviews child(ren)/caregivers, and completes the Structured Decision-Making (SDM) safety tool.
   •  Investigation or Family Assessment – Evidence gathering, collateral interviews, and medical/forensic exams when indicated. Time-frame: 45-day statutory limit, extensions by court order only.
   •  Case Disposition – "Unfounded," "Substantiated," or "Services Needed." If safety threats persist, we develop an Immediate Safety Plan or seek court-ordered protective custody.
   •  Service Planning & Ongoing Case Mgmt – Multi-disciplinary team drafts a Family Service Plan with measurable goals; reviewed every 90 days.
   •  Permanency Planning – Concurrent efforts toward reunification, kinship placement, or adoption. Court review hearings every 6 months.
   •  Case Closure – Achieved when safety risks are resolved and the family has demonstrated 90 consecutive days of stability, or when legal custody transfers permanently.

2.  Current Day-to-Day Obstacles
   •  Caseloads: Front-line staff average 28–32 open cases each (best-practice benchmark is 12–15).
   •  Staffing: We have two investigator vacancies and 18 % annual turnover; onboarding a new worker takes ~4 months.
   •  Placement Shortages: Only 58 licensed foster beds are available county-wide; teens and large sibling groups are routinely placed out of county.
   •  Funding: Preventive-service line item was cut 6 % this fiscal year, delaying in-home parenting services by up to 3 weeks.
   •  Policy/Legal Constraints: Statutory 45-day investigation window + new e-filing rules have added ~1.5 hours of documentation per case.

3.  Recent Updates & Pilot Programs
   •  Rapid Response Diversion Team (launched Jan 2025) – pairs a paramedic and social-worker to triage low-risk neglect calls and connect families to resources within 48 hrs; early data show a 14 % drop in formal investigations.
   •  Mobile Documentation Pilot – field tablets and voice-to-text notes; projected to cut desk paperwork time by 20 % (currently in beta with 6 workers).
   •  Trauma-Informed Supervision Training – all supervisors completing 4-session curriculum by August.

4.  Data Points & Illustrative (Anonymized) Examples
   •  1,200 referrals received in CY-2024; 38 % substantiated, 15 % resulted in court-ordered removal.
   •  Median time from intake to investigation closure: 45 days; median open case length including services: 180 days.
   •  Example "Case Alpha" (siblings ages 4 & 6): Neglect referral; due to placement shortages, siblings were separated for 19 days until a kinship placement licensed. Highlights impact of bed scarcity.

Let me know if you need clarifications, more data, or a different angle. If Tuesday is still your target, this should give you a solid base, but I can provide deeper numbers or connect you with our QA analyst.
