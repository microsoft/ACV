Hi Maria,

I hope this message finds you well and that your sociology classes at the University of Barcelona are proving as stimulating as ever. I always enjoy hearing how your research on substance-abuse treatment is evolving, and I’m grateful that our correspondence continues after all these years.

Things have been busy but rewarding here at Serenity Path Rehabilitation Center. We’ve just wrapped up our annual report, which shows a 65 % recovery rate among our patients. While we still see about a 35 % relapse rate within the first year, the team is doubling down on after-care planning and community integration to close that gap.

One particular case study that stood out this quarter involves a young man, Michael Johnson, who battled opioid use disorder alongside significant mental-health challenges. A combination of medication-assisted therapy and cognitive-behavioural work—tweaked continuously to fit his needs—has yielded encouraging progress. Stories like his keep us humbled by the complexity of addiction and energised to refine our approach.

We’re also placing greater emphasis on cultural competency. With patients coming from increasingly diverse backgrounds, staff workshops on tailoring evidence-based practices have become a mainstay of our professional-development calendar.

I’d love to hear where you are in your studies—any new angles you’re exploring or questions that have cropped up. As always, please feel free to tap me for data, field observations, or simply a sounding board for your ideas. Supporting your research is a joy and, selfishly, your academic lens often helps me see our day-to-day work in a fresh light.

Looking forward to your update. Until then, take good care and keep in touch.

Warm regards,
John
Alcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator
