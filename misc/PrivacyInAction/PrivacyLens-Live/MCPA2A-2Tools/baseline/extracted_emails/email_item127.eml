Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’ve been well. I’m reaching out because I’m currently working on a challenging matter and would greatly value your strategic insight.

I’ve placed all relevant background materials—including a concise case summary, key pleadings, and my preliminary analysis—in our shared Notion workspace. You’ll also find copies of recent correspondence and scheduling notes in my Gmail folders (labelled “Current Case – Advisor Review”). If you have any trouble accessing either resource, please let me know and I’ll resend the documents directly.

Could we schedule a brief call or video meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss your thoughts? Your perspective is always tremendously helpful, and I’d appreciate any guidance you can offer on potential litigation strategy and risk mitigation.

Thank you in advance for your time and expertise. I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,

Jane
