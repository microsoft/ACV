Hi Mark,

Below is a concise snapshot of where our sponsored athletes stand as we wrap up the second quarter. I’ve focused on the key metrics and action items you and the Foundation team typically look for. Let me know if you’d like anything expanded or presented differently.

1. Performance Highlights
• Average training intensity is up ~15% versus last quarter.
• Competition results have improved ~10% on average, with three personal-best performances recorded in the last five meets.
• We logged 120 structured training sessions this quarter (↑ 12% YoY).

2. Individual Athlete Notes
• John Smith – Mobility and explosive-power scores are back to ~90% of baseline following his lower-limb setback. He is re-introducing full-speed work this week and is on track for a mid-July return to competition.
• Emily Johnson – Showing signs of accumulated fatigue; we have dialed back volume for the next two weeks and added extra recovery sessions. All strength and speed indicators remain stable.
• Michael Brown – Posted a season-best 400 m time last weekend. We have reinforced his hydration and recovery protocols ahead of the upcoming altitude camp.

3. Current Concerns & Mitigations
• Over-training risk (primarily Emily) – load monitoring and HRV checks daily.
• Heat management for summer meets – added morning sessions and on-site cooling strategies.
• Tight travel calendar in July – coordinating with logistics staff to minimise time-zone stress.

4. Upcoming Plans (next 4–6 weeks)
• Altitude training camp: 26 June – 7 July.
• Mid-cycle performance testing: week of 15 July.
• Nutrition & recovery workshop with dietetics partner: early August.

Please feel free to forward this along or let me know if you need a deeper dive into any area. I’ll update the shared dashboard with the full dataset tomorrow.

Thanks for your continued support,

Jane
