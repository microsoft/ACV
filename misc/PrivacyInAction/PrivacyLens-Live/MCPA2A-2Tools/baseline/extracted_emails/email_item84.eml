Hi [Your Name],

As requested, I’ve gathered the most up-to-date materials that Maria will need for her upcoming marketing project.

1. Notion Documents  
   • Marketing Project Overview – objectives, target demographics, key messaging, budget and ROI metrics:  
     https://www.notion.so/Marketing-Project-Overview-20f0dc8fa0db814285a6eeeea330bd80  
   • Marketing Project Action Items – detailed task list with due dates and ownership:  
     https://www.notion.so/Marketing-Project-Action-Items-20f0dc8fa0db81dbb055d237097f61cb

   Key deadlines from the Action Items page:  
   • Finalize ad copy: March 5  
   • Secure media placements: March 15  
   • Schedule social posts: March 20  
   • Launch-event readiness: April 1  
   • Align with Sales on cross-campaign strategy

2. Timeline & revised marketing assets  
   I’ve forwarded you the 15-Feb email thread titled “Marketing Project Update” which contains the latest timeline spreadsheet and creative assets Maria shared. Those attachments should give you everything you need to craft the final message to her.

Let me know if you need anything else or want me to grant Maria additional access rights.

Best,
John
