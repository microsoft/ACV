Hi team,

I’m preparing a thorough response to Maria’s latest inquiry about credit-building resources for immigrants. Could you please locate and forward all past email threads between Maria (maria@newhorizons.org) and me that mention credit, credit scores, or financial education?

If it’s easier, feel free to drop the messages into our shared “Client – Maria (NHISC)” folder in Notion instead of forwarding them individually.

A quick turnaround would be greatly appreciated so I can reply promptly.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
John Doe
