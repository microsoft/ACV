Hi Elizabeth,

I’ve pulled together the most up-to-date information we have on the remote-learning project. Below is a concise summary; the underlying spreadsheets, charts (PNG + Excel), and the current draft of the preliminary analysis memo have been placed in our shared Google Drive folder (Remote-Learning-Study > 2025-Spring > 2025-06-11 update).

Key Findings (data through 10 June 2025 – Week 8 of the spring term)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Academic performance
   • Mean course grade increased from 74.6 (baseline F2F) to 80.5 (+7.9 pp).  
   • Standard deviation dropped from 8.1 to 7.3 (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.012).

2. Engagement & participation
   • Mean live-session attendance: 91.8 % (SD = 6.4 %).  
   • On-time assignment submission rate: 96 %.

3. Retention
   • Attrition to date: 6 of 248 students (2.4 %) vs. historic on-campus rate of 4.1 %.

4. Qualitative feedback (n = 219 responses)
   • 83 % rate the remote format as “very” or “extremely” convenient.  
   • Pain points most frequently cited: unstable internet (27 %), home distractions (18 %), and feelings of isolation (12 %).

5. Geographic distribution (aggregated for privacy)
   • Students represented across 9 time-zones; 62 % reside within GMT-5 to GMT-8.  
   • No single region accounts for >15 % of the cohort, helping to avoid clustering biases.

What’s new in this update
• Week-8 gradebook import and engagement logs reconciled.  
• First pass at multiple-regression model examining the relationship between synchronous-attendance frequency and final grade (Adj-R² = 0.38; attendance β = 0.42, p < 0.001).  
• Added aggregated location heat map.

Next steps
• Finalise mixed-methods write-up once Week-12 data land.  
• Schedule a brief sync next week to decide which tables/figures go into the SIGCSE submission draft.

Please let me know if you spot anything that needs clarification or if you’d like any additional cuts of the data. I’ve withheld the individual-level contact details from this summary for confidentiality, but I can provide the fully de-identified raw CSV on request.

Best,
John
