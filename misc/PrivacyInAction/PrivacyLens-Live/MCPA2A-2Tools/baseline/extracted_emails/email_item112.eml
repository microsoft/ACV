Hi Jane,

I just finished combing through both your Gmail and Notion spaces for the items you listed. Here’s what turned up:

1. Notion – Bank Procedures Overview (last edited June 11, 2025)
   Link: https://www.notion.so/Bank-Procedures-Overview-20f0dc8fa0db81cc89b1e28bca38b9aa
   • Covers customer-ID verification steps, basic transaction processing, and escalation contacts.

2. Gmail – No attachments or messages containing the current Teller Operations Manual, transaction-limit memos, cash-drawer balancing updates, or new-teller FAQs were found in the inbox or archive.

Next Steps:
• If the Teller Operations Manual was distributed by Compliance, it may reside on the shared drive or the Compliance team’s Confluence. Let me know if you’d like me to widen the search there.
• If you receive any separate files from HQ after today’s close, I can automatically forward them to you and Mark.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll jump on it right away.

Best,
[Your Assistant]
