Hi Emily,

As promised, here is a quick reference sheet you can keep on hand when working with clients who present with anxiety disorders. I pulled the core points from the “Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety” and “Recommended Reading on Anxiety Disorders” notes in my workspace and trimmed them down to the essentials.

────────────────────────────────
ASSESSMENT & CASE FORMULATION
• Use a brief screener up front (GAD-7, BAI). Repeat every 4–6 sessions to track progress.
• Clarify the maintaining cycle: trigger → interpretation → physiological arousal → safety behaviour/avoidance.
• Screen for differential diagnoses (panic vs GAD vs SAD vs OCD) and common comorbidities (depression, substance use).

CORE CBT INTERVENTIONS ("Three Pillars")
1. Psycho-education – normalise anxiety, explain the fight-or-flight system, introduce the CBT model.
2. Cognitive restructuring – identify hot thoughts, examine evidence, develop balanced alternatives; use thought records in session, then assign as homework.
3. Behavioural experiments & exposure – build a graded hierarchy (0–100 SUDS) and practise until SUDS drop ≥ 50 % on two consecutive trials. Include interoceptive exposure for panic and imaginal exposure for GAD/social fears.

SKILLS & COPING STRATEGIES
• Diaphragmatic breathing (4-6-8 cycle) – 5 min, 2–3×/day.
• Progressive muscle relaxation OR cue-controlled relaxation.
• Mindfulness "3-minute breathing space" – useful between sessions.
• Grounding (5–4–3–2–1) for acute spikes.
• Worry postponement box & scheduled worry time (GAD).

LIFESTYLE & SYSTEMIC FACTORS
• Sleep hygiene (consistent wake time, no screens 30 min before bed).
• 30 min of moderate aerobic exercise 4×/week.
• Limit caffeine < 200 mg/day and reduce alcohol.
• Strengthen social support—assign behavioural activation tasks that involve others.

PHARMACOTHERAPY QUICK NOTE (coordinate with PCP/psychiatry)
• First–line: SSRIs/SNRIs (e.g., sertraline, escitalopram). Typical response: 4–6 weeks.
• Benzodiazepines: short-term or rescue only; educate about dependence.
• Augmentation strategies: buspirone, atypical antipsychotics for refractory cases.

RELAPSE-PREVENTION
• Identify early-warning signs; create a "relapse signature" list with the client.
• Develop coping cards & a maintenance plan; schedule booster sessions at 1, 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

FLEXIBLE ADAPTATIONS BY PRESENTATION
• Panic Disorder – emphasise interoceptive exposure & misinterpretation correction.
• Social Anxiety – incorporate video feedback & attention-training (shifting to external cues).
• GAD – add worry postponement, problem-solving therapy and imaginal exposure to feared outcomes.
• OCD – exposure w/ response prevention (ERP); keep exposures long enough for habituation.

RECOMMENDED RESOURCES
• “The Anxiety & Worry Workbook” – Clark & Beck.
• “Mind Over Mood” (2nd ed.) – Greenberger & Padesky.
• Oxford Guide to Behavioural Experiments in CBT – Bennett-Levy et al.

Feel free to tweak or condense further for your reply. Let me know how it goes or if you’d like to dig into case-specific hurdles—happy to help.

Best,
John
