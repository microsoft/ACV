Hi David,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve drafted a concise set of ideas to streamline our corporate tax-audit workflow and posted them in the shared Notion workspace. When you have a moment, could you please review those notes and let me know:

• Any refinements or additions you’d recommend
• Potential implementation hurdles you foresee
• Tools or metrics we might leverage to track efficiency gains

Your perspective as our third-party collaborator from Fiscal Dynamics Consulting is invaluable, and your input will help us move forward more effectively.

Thank you in advance for your time, and please feel free to suggest a quick call if that would be easier.

Best regards,

Jane Smith
IRS Tax Auditor
