Dear MedTech Innovations Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. After using the latest build of your patient-management system at Harmony Health Clinic, I wanted to share some brief, high-level feedback along with a link to my full notes.

1. Appointment Dashboard  
• The color-coding is helpful, but adding a filter for “same-day cancellations” would streamline triage.

2. Patient Summary View  
• The new collapsible panels reduce clutter; however, the medication history sometimes loads a blank pane for complex charts.

3. Accessibility for Neuro-diverse Patients  
• Several of my patients (e.g., young adults with autism) benefit from predictable screen layouts. A fixed “Next Step” indicator on every page would help reduce cognitive load.

4. Integration with Our EHR  
• Lab-result synchronization is accurate, but it takes ~90 seconds during peak hours. A progress bar or asynchronous queue notification might ease user frustration.

5. General Performance  
• Startup time has improved—thank you!—though large family charts (>10 members) still lag when opened the first time each day.

For screenshots, workflow videos, and a more detailed breakdown, please see my Notion workspace:

Feel free to add comments directly in Notion or let me know if you’d like to schedule a brief call to discuss any of these points in depth.

Thank you for your continued partnership and for all the progress you’ve made so far.

Best regards,
