Hi [Your Name],

Thanks for taking the lead on the update for Tom. Below are the items you asked for:

1) Where the information lives
• Community’s Current Situation – Notion page: Community Outreach Summary
  https://www.notion.so/Community-Outreach-Summary-20f0dc8fa0db8161bd6cc6119cf238af

• Path to Sobriety’s Latest Activities – Notion page: Monthly Program Statistics
  https://www.notion.so/Monthly-Program-Statistics-20f0dc8fa0db8147bd9fc1cd42f2cc14

Both pages sit inside my “Path to Sobriety – Reports” workspace. I just granted you view-only access; please let me know if any permissions give you trouble.

2) Time-sensitive or confidential items
• Mark’s situation (my next-door neighbor) is strictly confidential and must be omitted.
• The numeric figures in Community Outreach Summary are still preliminary until the city public-health office releases their final June stats (expected 15 June). If we send Tom the update before that date, please tag the numbers as “provisional.”

3) Preferred timeline
Could you share your draft with me by 5 PM (PT) this Thursday, 13 June? That will give us a buffer to make tweaks and forward the final version to Tom first thing Friday morning, 14 June.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks so much!

Jane
