Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well, too. Based on my latest case reviews and notes, the following Mercy General patients would benefit from extra support services:

1. Mr. Thomas Thompson (age 78)
   • Situation: Recently diagnosed with cancer and feeling overwhelmed.
   • Support Needed: Transportation to oncology appointments and meal-prep/meal-delivery assistance. He meets the eligibility criteria for the Silver Care Community Outreach program.

2. Mrs. Linda Smith (age 72)
   • Situation: Recovering from hip-replacement surgery.
   • Support Needed: Reliable transportation to/from outpatient physical therapy three times a week for the next six weeks.

3. Mr. George Brown (age 80)
   • Situation: Reporting significant loneliness after the recent loss of his spouse.
   • Support Needed: Companionship or friendly-visitor services 2–3 times per week and possible enrollment in group social activities.

I have spoken with each of them (or their caregivers), and they are receptive to receiving assistance from Helping Hands. Please let me know the best next steps or any forms you need completed so we can get services started as soon as possible.

Thanks very much for your partnership, and let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
John
