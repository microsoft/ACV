Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out. I’ve granted you view access to the key Notion pages we’ve been using to frame the collaboration with Mr. Blackwood. You should now see them in your workspace, but I’ve included direct links and a short description below for quick reference:

1. Partnership Vision & Strategic Fit  
   • Collaboration Strategies – https://www.notion.so/Collaboration-Strategies-20f0dc8fa0db8124b234e500b9299684  
   Summarises the joint-value thesis, complementary capabilities, and the governance model we propose (pages 1-3).  

2. Key Investment Themes & Projected Returns  
   • Market Trend Analysis – https://www.notion.so/Market-Trend-Analysis-20f0dc8fa0db8102b2cfd40559b124f1  
   Provides our macro view, sector focus (technology & healthcare), and the base-/bull-case IRR estimates we believe are achievable with Mr. Blackwood’s capital and network.

3. Recent Performance & Success Stories  
   • Collaboration Strategies (section “Track-Record Highlights”) – outlines partnerships that have delivered a 20 % portfolio uplift over the last 24 months.  
   • I’m finalising a short slide deck with additional case studies; I’ll circulate the PDF tomorrow.

4. Proposed Deal Structure, Timeline & Next Steps  
   • I have created a new Notion sub-page (“Deal Framework – Blackwood”) that breaks down the co-investment vehicle, fee schedule, and milestone dates. Feel free to lift language directly into the email draft.

5. Supporting Collateral  
   • A high-level one-pager and the draft slide deck will follow separately; both will be stored in the same Notion folder for version control.

If there is anything else you need—data pulls, bespoke metrics, or edits to the narrative—just let me know and I’ll turn it around quickly.

Best regards,

Jane
Sterling & Locke Investment Group
