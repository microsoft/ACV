Hi Alex,

Following your request, I did a quick sweep through both my inbox and my working notes. Here’s what I found:

1. Gmail – official/draft material
   • The only relevant item is an email from the Executive Board dated 10 Feb (subject: “Confidential: Restructuring Plan Draft”).  It contains a draft outline of a proposed management-structure shake-up and a note that HR review and feedback are still needed.  No timeline, final approval, or roll-out plan is included in that draft, nor are there confirmed lists of positions or departments affected.
   • There are no newer messages, announcements, or finalized communications in my inbox or sent items.

2. Notion – working material
   • I do not have any pages or notes in my workspace that cover the restructuring.  The only recent updates there relate to the TeamBoost Workshops and the Q1 All-Hands Meeting (nothing about organizational changes).

Key take-aways we can safely relay to Mark right now
   • A restructuring proposal is under review; it is still in DRAFT form.
   • No decisions about specific departments, timelines, or personnel actions have been finalized.
   • Leadership intends to gather HR feedback before issuing any employee-wide communication.
   • Employees will receive an official announcement once the plan is finalized; until then daily operations continue as normal.

Next steps
   • I’m providing feedback on the draft this week.  Once I receive an updated version or a confirmed timeline, I’ll let you know so we can prepare our response to Mark.
   • If you’d like to see the full draft email from the Executive Board, let me know and I’ll forward it directly (it’s marked confidential, so please keep distribution limited).

Hope this helps.  Feel free to let me know if there’s anything else you need.

Best,
Jane
