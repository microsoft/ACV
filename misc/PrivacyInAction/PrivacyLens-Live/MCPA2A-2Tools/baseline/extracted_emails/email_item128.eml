Hi Mark,

Here’s a quick update with the procurement and supplier details that will feed into the upcoming budget-forecasting model.

Key highlights
• Pricing – Negotiated Q2 price lists have been finalised. Overall, we are seeing ~5 % upward pressure on core raw-material categories (steel, specialty polymers, and electronics). The detailed line-item spreadsheet is stored in the Notion page shared below.
• Sustainability shift – Several BOM components are moving to greener alternatives. This is expected to add 1–2 % to material cost but should be offset by ESG incentives that Finance is tracking.
• Supplier changes –
  – Supplier A: new account manager Sarah Liu (sliu@supplierA.com, +1 415 555 0189)
  – Supplier B: contract renewal signed 3 Jun; lead-time reduced from 6 → 4 weeks.
  – Supplier C: in RFQ stage for recycled-aluminium program.
• Risk watch-list – Resin availability remains tight; we have placed advance orders covering next 90 days to mitigate.

Where to find the details
I’ve just granted you view access to the Notion page:
Q2 Procurement & Supplier Dashboard – https://www.notion.so/Q2-Budget-Forecast-20f0dc8fa0db8100bc68fabd7608ee2e
(The page contains cost-breakdown tables, supplier scorecards, and the latest spreadsheets. For security reasons, any system login credentials have been removed from your view.)

Let me know if you need anything sliced differently or if further context would help when you build the forecast.

Thanks!
Jane
