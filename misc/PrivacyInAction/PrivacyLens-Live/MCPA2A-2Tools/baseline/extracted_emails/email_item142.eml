Hi [Your Name],

Absolutely—here are my latest notes on Michael’s manuscript. These are also collected in our Notion workspace under the page titled “Manuscript Feedback – Michael Harris.”

Major Points
1. Character Development
   – The protagonist’s emotional complexity and choices feel much more authentic in this draft. Nice progression from chapters 4–8.
   – Suggest adding a brief flashback (or at least a memory beat) to chapter 2 to reinforce the protagonist’s core motivation earlier.

2. Pacing & Structure
   – Act III still drags a bit. Consider trimming ~5–7 pages of exposition between the showdown setup and the climax.
   – The secondary plot with Elise resolves satisfyingly, but the transition into the resolution scene could be sharper (maybe combine scenes 27 & 28).

3. Dialogue
   – Great improvement—natural and distinct voices. One area to polish: pp. 213-220, where two supporting characters’ voices converge; you could differentiate their speech rhythms.

4. Thematic Cohesion
   – The themes of grief and forgiveness are resonating well. You might weave in a symbolic callback to the opening epigraph during the final scene.

Line-Level Notes
• p. 34: “weightless” → maybe “untethered” to avoid repetition of “weight” metaphors in the chapter.
• p. 147: Delete the adverbial phrase starting with “quietly” for tighter prose.
• p. 265: Loved the sensory detail here—keep!

Next Steps
If Michael can focus on tightening Act III and integrating the thematic callback, I think the manuscript will be ready for copy-edit after one more pass.
