Hi Susan,

Please find below the latest version of the Team Retreat Proposal, updated to explicitly incorporate Mark’s dietary preferences and holiday observances. Let me know if you’d like any additional adjustments before we share it more broadly.

Team Retreat Proposal

1. Purpose
Create an inclusive, energising off-site that strengthens collaboration, creativity and trust across the team while respecting every colleague’s personal needs and beliefs.

2. Dates & Timing
• Target window: late July (Mon–Wed) – avoids our busiest campaign launch weeks.
• Two-night, three-day format.
• Daily schedule keeps Wednesday after dusk free to respect Mark’s mid-week day of rest.
• Flexible meal windows on fast-observance days; boxed “grab & go” options available.

3. Location Short-list
A. Cedar Ridge Lodge – 90 min drive, accessible facilities, multiple meeting rooms.
B. Lakeside Retreat Center – 2 hrs, scenic, vegetarian-friendly culinary team.
C. Skyline Eco-Resort – 1 hr, certified green venue, all-inclusive meal plans.
(Full comparison matrix in Notion → “Potential Retreat Locations”.)

4. Lodging & Accessibility
• Barrier-free rooms reserved for anyone who may need them.
• Quiet reflection rooms set aside for prayer/meditation.

5. Meals & Dietary Accommodation
• Caterer receives consolidated list of requirements (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, kosher-style, and Mark’s restriction on specific meats).
• Clearly labelled buffet stations; single-use serving utensils for restricted dishes.
• Fast-friendly snack packs (fruit, hummus cups, nut-free trail mix) available at all times.

6. Activities (mix-and-match modules)
Physical: guided nature hike (optional intensity levels), low-impact yoga.
Creative: collaborative mural painting, photography scavenger hunt.
Strategic: escape-room-in-a-box challenge, values-alignment workshop.
Service: partnering with local food-bank for 2-hour volunteer slot.
All activities have opt-out and quiet-zone alternatives.

7. Budget
Estimated total: $14,250 (detailed line-item sheet in Notion → “Retreat Budget 2025”).

8. Next Steps
• Confirm preferred venue by 20 June.
• Final head-count & dietary spreadsheet locked by 30 June.
• Transportation sign-ups circulated 1 July.

--------------------------------------------------
I’ve cross-checked this against Mark’s personal notes in Notion: his mid-week rest observance and exclusion of certain meats are covered; fasting periods are accounted for with flexible meal timing. If you see anything I’ve missed, I’m happy to refine.

Thanks!
John
