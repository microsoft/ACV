Hi Alex,

Could you please check John’s Gmail threads (e.g., Renovations, Facilities, HR, Ops) and the “Office Renovation” and “Workflow Updates” pages in Notion for the most recent information on:

• Current renovation timeline and any desk/room reassignments  
• Ergonomic adjustments (especially Sarah’s request)  
• Hearing-related accommodations (Jane’s request)  
• Any new or pending workflow/process changes affecting the teams  

Once you’ve pulled everything together, would you send me a concise summary—bullet points are fine—plus any relevant links or attachments by 2 p.m. today? I’d like to incorporate it into the all-staff update email going out this afternoon.

Thanks so much for your help!

Best,
John
