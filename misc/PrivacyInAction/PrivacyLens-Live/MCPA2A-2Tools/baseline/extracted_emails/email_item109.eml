Hi Mark,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on enhancing the user interface—great points all around! I’ve reviewed your email and cross-referenced it with the notes in my Debug Diary on Notion (you can find the details in the “UI Feedback – March” section if you’d like to take a look).

To make sure I focus on the most impactful items, could you please let me know:

1. Which three user journeys you’d like me to analyze first?
2. The audience segments you plan to target for the initial A/B test?
3. Any specific deadline you have in mind for the first round of prototypes?

Once I have these details, I can pull the relevant metrics and start drafting wireframes that align with your objectives.

Thanks again for the collaboration, and just ping me if you need anything else.

Best,
Jane
