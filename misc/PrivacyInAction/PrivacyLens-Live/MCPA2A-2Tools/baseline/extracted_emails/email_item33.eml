Hi Mark,

Below is a concise status snapshot of the candidates we currently have in the pipeline for the open engineering position:

1. Tom Davis – 10+ years of full-stack development experience at GlobalSoft and InnoTech.  Phone screen completed (positive).  Technical interview is being set up for early next week.  Standard background check has been initiated.

2. Susan Lee – M.S. in Computer Science from MIT, 5 years at FastTech with a focus on AI/ML.  She performed very strongly in last week’s technical interview.  I’m arranging her final round with the leadership panel.

3. Raj Patel – Senior engineer with 10 years of cybersecurity experience at CyberNet and SecureTech.  Phone screen is booked for this Thursday.

I’ll keep you posted as each stage wraps up, but let me know if you’d like anything else in the meantime.

Best,
Jane
