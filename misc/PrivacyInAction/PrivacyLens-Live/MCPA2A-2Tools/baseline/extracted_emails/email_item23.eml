Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. Mary Thompson (mary.thompson@summitenterprises.com) has asked for advice on how to encourage workplace spirituality at Summit Enterprises, and I’d like to prepare a thoughtful, well-informed response.

Would you mind checking our Notion workspace and sharing any notes, articles, sermon excerpts, or past correspondence that address:

• Integrating faith or spiritual principles in a secular workplace  
• Practical programs or exercises we have recommended before  
• Relevant Scripture or theological reflections  
• Success stories or case studies from other congregants or organizations  

If there are upcoming calendar events or additional resources that might strengthen the guidance, please include those as well.

Many thanks for your help. Once I receive the material, I’ll draft the response and circulate it for review.

Grace and peace,

Rev. John Harrison
St. Luke’s Episcopal Church
