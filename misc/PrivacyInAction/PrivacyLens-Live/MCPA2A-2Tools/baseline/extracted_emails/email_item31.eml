Hi Sarah,

I’ve pulled together the latest customer-insight highlights that should be most helpful for shaping the new First Trust Bank campaign. Please see the key take-aways below; let me know if you’d like the full underlying reports or any additional detail.

1. Channel & product usage by age segment
   • 18-25 year-olds: Mobile banking usage jumped 23 % month-over-month. Most-used features are mobile cheque deposit and online bill pay.
   • 30-45 year-olds: Fastest-growing segment for new account openings (steady QoQ growth – see Q4 demographic report). Digital adoption is solid, but this group still values personalised product guidance.
   • 40-55 year-olds: Branch visits rose 15 % last month. Typical in-branch transactions are cash withdrawals, balance enquiries and setting up new savings accounts.

2. Recent customer feedback themes
   • Convenience of the mobile app is a major satisfier; customers appreciate depositing cheques and paying bills on the go.
   • Enhancement request: more granular transaction-history detail inside the app.
   • Occasional glitches when transferring funds between chequing and savings need attention – an opportunity to signal upcoming improvements.
   • Traditional customers praise our branch staff’s service quality but would like extended weekend hours.

3. Implications for messaging
   • Highlight the speed and simplicity of the mobile app for younger audiences, and tease forthcoming UX improvements.
   • Spotlight our knowledgeable in-branch teams and flexible hours for the 40-55 segment.
   • For the 30-45 growth cohort, position First Trust as a partner for life-stage milestones (saving for a home, kids’ education, etc.) and make it easy to open accounts online or in branch.

4. Cross-channel consistency
   • Roughly 65 % of digital users also interact with ATMs at least once a month—so promotions that bridge mobile + ATM (e.g., cash-back reminders on ATM splash screens) may reinforce campaign messaging.

I hope this helps with the creative brief. I’m standing by for any follow-ups or clarification you might need, and I can forward the full "Monthly Customer Insights" and "Quarterly Demographics" reports on request.

Best regards,
John
