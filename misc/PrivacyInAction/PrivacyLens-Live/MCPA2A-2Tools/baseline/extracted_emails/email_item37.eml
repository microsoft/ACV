Hi Sarah,

Thanks for pulling together the brief and background docs. I’ve reviewed the Gmail thread as well as the material in the Notion “Retreat Planning” workspace (and cross-checked it with my recent team-evaluation notes).

Here are my main take-aways and recommendations:

1. Key objectives
   • Strengthen inter-departmental communication.
   • Give the team a chance to practice strategic thinking in a low-stakes setting.

2. Activities to support those goals
   • Half-day facilitated strategy workshop (external coach – the one you flagged in the vendor list looks like a good fit).
   • Communication/role-play exercise or “escape-room”–style challenge right after the workshop to reinforce lessons.
   • Light outdoor activity on Day 2 morning (short hike or paddle-boarding) to keep energy up without exhausting people before the afternoon wrap-up.

3. Schedule tweaks
   • Move the vendor welcome dinner to the first evening instead of Day 2 lunch; this should help people settle in and start interacting early.
   • Keep Day 3 strictly for reflection + travel, no new content.

4. Vendor decisions
   • Venue: I’m comfortable locking in Summit Peak Lodge. Their mid-range AV package (Tier 2) will cover the workshop’s needs without overspending.
   • Coach/facilitator: Greenlight from my side – please move forward with the deposit.

5. Budget check
   • All of the above keeps us inside the current allocation assuming ~35 participants; I’ve allowed a 7 % buffer for last-minute additions.

Next steps
   • If you can incorporate the adjustments into the draft schedule and send the revised outline to the vendors by Thursday, I’ll do a final pass on numbers the same day so we can sign contracts before Friday’s cutoff.

Let me know if you’d like me to draft the session brief for the facilitator or handle any of the contract language.

Thanks again for steering this – it’s coming together nicely!

Best,
John
