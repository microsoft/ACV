Hi Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is the information Dr. Patel requested ahead of our initial consultation.

1. Brief overview of our family-planning goals
• We are a lesbian couple (Jane – age 34, Alex – age 33) hoping to conceive our first child beginning later this year.
• We would like to discuss both IUI with donor sperm and reciprocal IVF so we understand success rates, costs, and timelines for each option.
• Our preference is for Alex to carry the pregnancy if her screening results are favorable, but we are open to whichever pathway gives us the best chance of a healthy baby.
• Long-term, we would love a two-child family, so we’re interested in talking about embryo storage for future use.

2. Relevant medical history & prior evaluations
Jane
• Generally healthy; regular cycles, no history of gynecological issues.
• Baseline fertility labs (AMH, FSH, estradiol) drawn by Dr. Emily Harris last month – all within normal range. Pelvic ultrasound was normal.
• No prior fertility treatments.

Alex
• Generally healthy; regular cycles. Family history of fraternal twins on Alex’s maternal side.
• Basic fertility panel scheduled for next week (results will be forwarded once available).
• No prior fertility treatments.

3. Current medications & supplements
Jane: Daily prenatal vitamin (One-A-Day brand), 2000 IU vitamin D, occasional ibuprofen for headaches.
Alex: Daily prenatal vitamin (Garden of Life), 1,000 mg omega-3, 5 mg melatonin as needed for sleep (≤2×/week).
Neither of us smokes; we drink alcohol only occasionally (1-2 drinks/week).

4. Insurance information
• Primary insurer: BlueShield PPO – Policy #BS-47829972-01 (both Jane & Alex listed). Fertility benefits include diagnostic testing and up to 3 IUI cycles; IVF coverage is limited to medication only. We will bring the full benefits summary to the visit.

5. Preferred dates/times for the initial consultation
From the windows we noted in our planning document, the following work best for us:
• Friday, March 15 – anytime after 10:00 AM PT (telehealth preferred)
• Monday, March 18 – 9:00 AM–2:00 PM PT (in-person or telehealth)
• Wednesday, April 10 – 11:00 AM–4:00 PM PT (in-person)
If none of these are available, please suggest the next earliest weekday slot.

6. Dr. Emily Harris’s notes
We have asked Dr. Harris’s office to forward her recent exam notes, lab results, and ultrasound report directly to you. If you do not receive them within a few days, please let us know and we’ll follow up.

Please let us know if any additional information would be helpful before the appointment. We’re excited to work with Dr. Patel and your team.

Warm regards,

Jane Doe & Alex Smith
