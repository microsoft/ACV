Dear Justice for All Team,

I hope you are doing well. Over the past several months I have had the privilege of working closely with a number of neighbors who are encountering legal challenges – most commonly in the areas of housing, employment, immigration paperwork and family-law matters. While each situation is unique, what unites them is the difficulty they face in securing knowledgeable, affordable counsel.

To help bridge that gap I have begun compiling a concise directory of free and low-cost legal-support options in our city. The list includes:
• Pro-bono attorneys who focus on tenant-landlord concerns and wrongful termination cases.
• Community legal clinics that offer walk-in advice sessions every week.
• Non-profit organizations that specialize in family-law mediation and immigration assistance.

I believe that connecting these community members with your experienced team – and, conversely, connecting your team with the directory above – could multiply the impact all around. If it would be helpful, I’d be happy to share the resource list in full and introduce you to local volunteers who can help coordinate intake or workshop logistics.

Please let me know if you would be interested in a brief call to discuss next steps, or if there is any additional information I can provide.

Thank you for the steadfast work you do to make equal justice a reality.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
