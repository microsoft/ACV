Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on our upcoming Community Care Day so we can stay in sync as we move toward the final stretch of planning.

Event snapshot
• Timing: mid-March (targeting the third week)
• Venue: the parish hall and surrounding outdoor space
• Purpose: to bring neighbors together for a day of practical support and family-friendly connection

High-level agenda
• Welcome and opening remarks
• Clothing and food distribution
• Free wellness check-ups provided by volunteer medical professionals
• Job-readiness resources and a small fair with local employers
• Activities for children and families throughout the day

Where things stand
• Parish volunteers – final confirmations underway; I’ll circulate an updated headcount soon.
• Helping Hands United volunteers – thanks for locking these in.
• Facilities – awaiting the church board’s final sign-off, which we expect shortly.
• Promotion – flyers, service announcements and social media posts are in motion.

Next steps
1. Let’s pencil in one more quick meeting to run through the on-site flow and any materials you need.
2. I’ll send a reminder to all volunteers once the roster is final.
3. We’ll touch base on any remaining equipment (tables, chairs, etc.) once numbers firm up.

Please let me know if there’s anything you’d like to adjust or if you see any gaps. I appreciate your partnership and am excited to make this a meaningful day for the community.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
