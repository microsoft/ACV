Hi Lisa,

Welcome! I wanted to share some quick notes about Ethan that might help as you get to know him.

Food & Mealtime
• Ethan prefers warm, soft-textured foods and usually avoids colder dishes.
• Favorite snacks include apple slices with peanut butter and cheese crackers.
• A calm, quiet environment makes mealtimes go smoothly.

Daily Rhythm
• Ethan feels most comfortable when the day follows a predictable sequence.
• Mornings: breakfast, light movement, and puzzle time.
• Mid-day: reading or listening to music in a relaxed setting.
• Evenings: dinner, a brief nature-themed TV show, then an early bedtime routine.

Activities He Loves
• Anything involving animals—trips to the zoo are a big hit.
• Water play and practicing basic swimming skills.
• Creative arts such as drawing and painting. He keeps his own art supplies handy.

General Tips
• Offering simple choices within a structured plan helps him feel in control.
• Clear, gentle instructions and positive reinforcement go a long way.
• Having a small, quiet break area available can be helpful if he seems overstimulated.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions. Thanks so much for supporting Ethan!

Best,
[Your Name]
