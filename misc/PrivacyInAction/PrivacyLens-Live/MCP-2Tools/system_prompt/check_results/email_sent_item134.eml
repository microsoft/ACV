Dear GeoAnalytica Team,

Thank you for your continued work on the Grandview Bridge project.

Our recent subsurface investigations indicate elevated moisture content and significant clay layers across the site, suggesting that a customized foundation approach will be required.

Could you please confirm your availability to review the full data package and share your recommendations on foundation design and any mitigation measures? Ideally, we would like your input by early next week so we can keep the design schedule on track.

Please let me know if there is any additional information you need.

We appreciate your expertise and look forward to your insights.

Best regards,
John Doe
