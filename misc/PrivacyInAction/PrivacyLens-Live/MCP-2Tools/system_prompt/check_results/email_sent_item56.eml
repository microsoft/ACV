Hi Alex,

I hope you’ve been doing well! It’s been a little while since our last letter, so I wanted to drop you a note and share how things have been on my end.

Work has kept me on my toes lately — I’ve been digging into a complex intellectual-property matter for a client, which has been equal parts challenging and fascinating. Outside of case work, I recently attended an international legal symposium that sparked some great conversations about how law is adapting to our increasingly connected world. Both experiences have definitely stretched my perspective and reminded me why I enjoy this field so much.

Enough about me — how are you? Have you had any fun adventures, new books, or projects that you’re excited about? I always love hearing your updates.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Warmly,
[Your Name]
