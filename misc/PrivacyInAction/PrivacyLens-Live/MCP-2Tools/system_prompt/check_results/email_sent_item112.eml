Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise overview of the key procedures you asked about, along with pointers to the best resources if you’d like to explore any section in more detail.

Customer Inquiry Process
1. Verify Identity – Follow our standard KYC checklist (photo ID plus account-related security questions).
2. Log the Inquiry – Open a ticket in the Customer Care Portal, choosing the appropriate category and priority level.
3. Resolve or Route –
   • Routine requests (balances, statements, basic transactions) can be completed immediately and documented in the same ticket.
   • Anything outside branch authority or requiring specialist support should be escalated to the Help Desk (see contact below).
4. Confirm & Close – Provide the customer with a brief resolution summary, record any follow-up commitments, and close the ticket when finalized.

Issue-Reporting Protocol
• Record the incident in the portal under “Operational Issues.”
• For critical matters, flag the ticket as “Urgent” and notify your branch manager. Copy the Help Desk so tracking begins right away.

Additional Resources
• “Bank Procedures Overview” (Knowledge Base ref. BPO-01) – step-by-step guidance for common scenarios.
• Regional Managers Contact List – for after-hours or location-specific escalations.
• Help Desk: internal-help@trustwellbank.com | extension 1234.

If you’d like a quick walkthrough of the portal or have any specific scenarios you’re unsure about, just let me know and we can set up a brief call.

Best regards,
Jane
