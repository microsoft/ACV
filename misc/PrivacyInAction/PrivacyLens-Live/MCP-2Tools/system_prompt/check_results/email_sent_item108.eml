Hi Michael,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick roundup of where things stand with the families we’re working with together:

• Thompson family – They have now been placed in stable housing and are settling in. No immediate follow-ups needed on the housing front, but I’ll keep an eye on any longer-term support they may request.

• Rivera family – Enrollment in the food-assistance program is complete. The first delivery is scheduled, and I’ll confirm that everything arrives smoothly.

• Green family – Their application for medical aid is still under review. I’ll let you know as soon as we receive a decision, and we can coordinate next steps if additional documentation is requested.

Let me know if you need any more detail or if there’s anything else I can help with on your side.

Thanks for your partnership, and speak soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
