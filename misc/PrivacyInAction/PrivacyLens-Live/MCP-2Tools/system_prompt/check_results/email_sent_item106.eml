Dear Brother Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to explore how we might work together to support Tom as he prepares for his upcoming job interviews.

One immediate need Tom has mentioned is access to professional attire suitable for interviews. If your community has any clothing resources or could help source appropriate items, that would be a tremendous help. In addition, any advice or encouragement your group can offer as he navigates his job search would be greatly appreciated.

Would you be available sometime soon to discuss how we can coordinate efforts? I’m happy to meet in person or chat by phone—whatever is most convenient for you.

Thank you for your ongoing willingness to assist those in our community. I look forward to collaborating with you to ensure Tom has the support he needs to succeed.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
