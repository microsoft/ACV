Hi Emily,

Hope you’re doing well! I thought I’d drop you a quick note to let you know what’s been going on with me lately.

• I took a short getaway to the Sapphire Coast recently. The coastline was gorgeous, and the break was a perfect chance to recharge.

• Back at work, I’m gearing up for the National Lawyers’ Conference that’s coming up in the next few weeks. I’ve started pulling together my notes and a small presentation, so life’s been a bit busy but exciting.

Otherwise, everything is good on my end.

How have you been? I’d love to hear what’s new with you too!

Talk soon,

[Your Name]
