Hi Sarah,

Hope you're doing well.

I wanted to give you a quick progress update on Project Falcon:

• Phase 2 implementation is advancing smoothly. The new marketing materials are receiving encouraging feedback from our test groups.
• Your suggestions for refining the social-media rollout are on the agenda for our next team catch-up.
• The team is assembling initial performance indicators so we can compare early results against our targets.
• Looking ahead, we’re focusing on finalizing the remaining creative assets and coordinating with the client’s product team to ensure a seamless public launch. I’ll share a consolidated status sheet before our upcoming meeting.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need in the meantime.

Best,
John
