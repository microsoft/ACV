Hi Ethan,

I’m excited to move forward with the cover for my upcoming novel, “Whispers of the Past.” Here’s the core brief:

• Mood: A blend of mystery and nostalgia.
• Key Visual Elements: An old, ornate key paired with a faded letter.
• Colour Palette: Muted, earthy tones (think weather-worn browns, soft olive greens, and hints of antique gold).

The design should feel timeless and slightly haunting—enough to intrigue readers while still conveying warmth and memory.

I’ll send the full synopsis and author bio in a separate message for added context. Let me know if you need anything else or if we should hop on a quick call to discuss.

Thanks so much, and I’m looking forward to your creative ideas!

Best,
[Your Name]
