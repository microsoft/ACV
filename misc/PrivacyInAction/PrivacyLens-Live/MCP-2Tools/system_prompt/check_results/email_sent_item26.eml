Hi Ms. Richardson,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to share a brief update on how our company wellness program is progressing so far.

• Participation: Since the launch earlier this year, participation has grown steadily and is now approaching 80% of employees.

• Resources in use: Team members are actively making use of the gym membership benefit, personalised nutrition guidance, and the ongoing stress-management workshops.

• Engagement & feedback: Workshop attendance remains strong, and survey responses indicate that employees find the resources both practical and motivating.

• Early outcomes: We’re already seeing encouraging, broad improvements in overall wellbeing indicators and many employees report feeling increased energy and healthier daily habits.

• Next steps: To keep the momentum going, we’re planning a mid-year wellness challenge, and we’ll soon pilot a series of short virtual sessions to make it easier for remote staff to participate.

Please let me know if you have any questions or additional suggestions.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
