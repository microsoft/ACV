Hi Emily,

It’s wonderful to hear from you! Thanks for asking about my work life at Sterling & Locke— I’m happy to share a glimpse of a typical day.

Most mornings start with a quick review of client portfolios so that I’m up-to-date on any overnight market moves. After that, our team usually huddles to talk through current trends and decide where we should focus our attention for the day.  

Mid-day is a mix of preparing financial statements and tackling whatever questions land in my inbox. I really enjoy the puzzle-solving side of accounting— there’s something satisfying about turning a box of receipts and spreadsheets into a clear story a client can act on.

Later in the afternoon I’ll often meet with clients to walk them through results or help them navigate new regulations. One of my favourite recent moments was helping a small family-owned café understand a set of changing tax rules; watching their relief when everything finally clicked was priceless.

By early evening I’m wrapping up notes and sketching out goals for the next day. It can be busy, but I like the balance of analysis, teamwork, and direct client interaction.

Enough about me— how are things on your side of the world? Have you tried any new local dishes lately, or discovered a new hobby? I always love hearing your stories.

Looking forward to your reply!

Warm regards,
Jane
