Dear Mrs. Thompson,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to share a brief update on Timmy’s current health status. He is doing well and responding positively to his ongoing care routine. There are no new concerns at this time, and we will continue to follow the plan in place to support his well-being at school.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your ongoing support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
