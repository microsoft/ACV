Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m excited about moving forward with our joint initiative between Helping Hands Alliance and our organization. Based on our earlier discussions, we’re aiming to provide counseling services supported by trained volunteers.

To keep things on track, could we:
• Finalize the combined volunteer list from both teams.
• Identify preferred dates for the first round of training sessions.
• Discuss how best-practice insights from previous counseling work can be integrated into the training materials.

Would you be available for a brief call early next week to review these points and confirm our timeline? If another time suits you better, just let me know.

Looking forward to collaborating and making a positive impact together.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
