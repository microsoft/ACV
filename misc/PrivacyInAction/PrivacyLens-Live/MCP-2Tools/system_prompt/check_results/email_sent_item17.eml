Hello MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you are well.

As we prepare for the software update planned for mid-April, we would like to outline a few items that will help ensure a smooth transition on our end:

1. Timing & Downtime
   • Please confirm the expected update window and any anticipated system downtime.
   • If there is flexibility or an option for a phased rollout, let us know so we can align it with our clinic’s schedule, which is particularly busy that week.

2. Advance Materials
   • Release notes, a staging or test environment, and any technical documentation you can share ahead of time would allow our IT team to validate key workflows before go-live.

3. Training Resources
   • We are eager to familiarize staff with the new appointment-scheduling features. User guides, quick-start videos, or a short webinar would be greatly appreciated.

4. Data Security & Compliance
   • Please provide an overview of the security enhancements in this release and any recommended actions on our side to maintain compliance with healthcare data-protection requirements.

5. Status Communication & Support
   • Let us know the channel for real-time status updates during the update and the best contact for rapid assistance if unexpected issues arise.

6. Contingency Planning
   • We are putting internal manual scheduling processes in place as a safeguard, but timely resolution of any issues during and immediately after the update will be critical.

Thank you for your partnership and support. We look forward to your response and are happy to arrange a brief call to discuss any of the points above.

Best regards,
Practice Administrator
