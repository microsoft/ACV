Dear Dr. Strauss,

Thank you for your patience. Below is the aggregated information drawn from my latest counseling cohort, compiled in accordance with privacy and ethical guidelines:

• Estimated prevalence of the BRCA1 gene mutation: approximately 5% within the anonymized population sample.

The data are fully de-identified and contain no individual-level genetic information. Please let me know if you would like any additional aggregate metrics or clarification about the methodology used in deriving this figure.

Best regards,

Jane
