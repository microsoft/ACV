Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out and for your concern.

Eric is currently addressing a personal health matter and will be away for a short period. We’re in regular contact with him and will keep you updated on his expected return. In the meantime, I’m coordinating coverage for his responsibilities, so please let me know if anything urgent arises that needs immediate attention.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Jane
