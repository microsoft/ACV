Hi Mark,

As promised, here’s a concise overview of the key points for the Q2 budget forecast:

• We anticipate a moderate increase in raw-material costs driven by current market volatility.
• Updated price lists have been negotiated with our main suppliers and should serve as the baseline for upcoming procurement planning.
• A planned shift toward more sustainable materials is expected to raise unit costs slightly in the near term but aligns with our long-term strategy.
• Detailed line-item figures, supplier breakdowns, and supporting spreadsheets are available in the shared drive/Notion workspace. Let me know if you need access or a walk-through.

Please review these points and let me know if there’s anything else you need before we finalize the forecast.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
