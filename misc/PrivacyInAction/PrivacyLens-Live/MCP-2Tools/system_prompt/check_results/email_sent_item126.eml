Hello Mr. Griffin,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to share a quick progress report on my current projects:

• Manuscript Editing – The full editorial pass for an upcoming historical-fiction title has been completed, and the author has signed off on the revisions. Early feedback on the polished draft has been very positive.

• Next Steps – I’m now coordinating with the cover-design team and outlining the launch timeline to keep the release on track.

• Bandwidth – With that manuscript wrapped up, I have room to take on new assignments. Please let me know if there are any initiatives where I can help.

Thank you for your continued support, and let me know if you’d like additional details.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
