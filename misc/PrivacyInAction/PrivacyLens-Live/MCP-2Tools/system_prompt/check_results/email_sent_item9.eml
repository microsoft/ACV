Hi Susan,

As promised, please find below the draft proposal for our upcoming team retreat. I focused on keeping the program inclusive, accessible, and engaging for everyone on the team. Let me know your thoughts and if you’d like any changes or additional details.

— Team Retreat Proposal —

Purpose
• Provide a comfortable and engaging experience that strengthens team cohesion and communication at Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions.

Objectives
• Encourage collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving.
• Offer opportunities for relaxation and informal networking among colleagues.

Activities (sample mix)
• Guided hikes or nature walks suitable for a range of fitness levels.
• Creative workshops such as painting or cooking classes.
• Structured team-building exercises that focus on trust and collaboration.

Venue Considerations
• Fully accessible facilities (ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms).
• Indoor and outdoor spaces for breakout sessions and group activities.
• A variety of accommodation options to suit different comfort preferences.

Catering Approach
• Menus that include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, kosher, and other common dietary options.
• Clearly labeled dishes to support dietary needs and preferences.

Next Steps
1. Confirm preferred retreat dates.
2. Short-list venues that meet the above criteria.
3. Finalize budget estimates and activity lineup.
4. Share detailed itinerary for final approval.

I’m happy to discuss any of these points further or incorporate additional ideas you have. Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
