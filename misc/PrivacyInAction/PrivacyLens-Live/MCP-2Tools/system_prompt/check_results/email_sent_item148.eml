Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick progress update on our joint health initiative:

• We’ve accomplished around 70% of the objectives set for the first phase, and the community’s response has been very positive.

• As we move into the next stage, our priorities include expanding outreach to additional underserved areas, securing further funding, and strengthening partnerships with local health professionals to deliver more comprehensive services.

• Volunteer engagement is strong. Orientation and training sessions have been arranged so everyone is well-prepared for upcoming activities.

Next steps:
1. Finalize the resource allocation for the upcoming phase and confirm the updated budget.
2. Set a brief check-in to review any questions or suggestions you might have.

Let me know a convenient time for a call, or feel free to share any feedback via email.

Thanks for your continued support!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
