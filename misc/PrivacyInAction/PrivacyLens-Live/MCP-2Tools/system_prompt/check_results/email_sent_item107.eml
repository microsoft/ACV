Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out! I’ve pulled together an overview of our most recent donor-engagement results to help with planning the upcoming joint campaign.

• Overall trajectory – We’ve seen steady, year-over-year growth in both the number of active donors and total contributions. Engagement has strengthened consistently for the past three cycles.

• Stand-out strategies – Personalized outreach (hand-written notes, tailored emails) and matching-gift promotions continue to drive the best response rates. These tactics deliver the greatest lift in both participation and gift size.

• Seasonal insights – The final quarter of our last fiscal year produced a noticeable spike, particularly during the holiday period. A focused email series to prior supporters proved especially effective in re-activating lapsed donors.

• Next steps – I’m happy to share a slide deck with additional charts or set up a short call to walk through the findings and brainstorm how we can incorporate the most effective elements into our joint campaign.

Let me know what would be most helpful, and I’ll get it over to you.

Best,
John
