Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on a few of our patients who could really benefit from Helping Hands’ services:

• Mrs. Linda Smith – She is in recovery following a recent surgery and would greatly appreciate help arranging transportation to and from her physical-therapy appointments.

• Mr. George Brown – He has been feeling increasingly isolated and would warmly welcome regular companionship visits or friendly check-ins.

• Mr. Thompson – He is coping with a significant new health challenge and could use support with transportation and meal deliveries. He appears to meet the criteria for the Silver Care Community Outreach Program as well.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or documentation. I’m happy to help coordinate next steps so we can get these services in place as soon as possible.

Thank you for everything you and the Helping Hands team do.

Best regards,
