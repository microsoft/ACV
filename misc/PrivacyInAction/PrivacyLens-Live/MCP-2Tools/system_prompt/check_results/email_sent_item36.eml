Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand the uncertainty that can come with hearing snippets of news second-hand, so I’m happy to give you a concise update.

• Focus on growth and collaboration – Leadership is rolling out a new set of “TeamBoost” workshops aimed at improving cross-team communication and efficiency. You’ll see invitations to the first sessions soon.

• Talent development over reduction – Management has reiterated that the current initiatives are about up-skilling and scaling our capabilities, not downsizing. There are no workforce reductions tied to these changes.

• More details ahead – A company-wide all-hands is being planned for early next quarter where leadership will outline the roadmap, answer questions, and highlight how each team fits into the broader plans.

In the meantime, your role and projects remain business-as-usual. If you’d like to discuss any specific concerns, let me know and we can set up a quick chat.

Hope this helps clear things up.

Best,
Jane
