Hello Alex,

Thank you for your message and for considering me for the Lead Developer position at InnovateX.

Based on my background leading engineering teams and the responsibilities outlined for this role, I am targeting a total annual compensation in the range of $140,000–$155,000, which would include base salary and performance-based incentives, with equity considered separately. I’m confident this range reflects the value I can bring to the team, and I’m open to discussing the overall package to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement.

I remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to InnovateX and look forward to the next steps.

Best regards,
John
