Hi Alex,

Thank you for outlining the additional data needs. In line with our data-sharing policy and privacy commitments to Union Trust Bank’s customers, I’m providing the latest anonymised, aggregated insights that should support your engagement analysis:

• Demographic & Spend Patterns
  – Customers in the 25-40 age band represent roughly 38 % of the active base with a median monthly spend near $2.8 k.
  – Debit-card transactions are up ~18 % year-over-year, reflecting the continued shift toward contactless payments.

• Channel Usage
  – Mobile banking adoption is strongest among customers under 30; about 72 % use the mobile app for at least half of their transactions.

• Product Mix
  – Mortgage and auto loans together account for about 45 % of total outstanding loan balances.

• Voice-of-Customer Highlights (Survey  🔎 )
  – High satisfaction with mobile-app convenience and branch staff expertise.
  – Some customers have reported longer than expected turnaround times for loan-application decisions.

All figures are aggregated and fully de-identified. If you need further segmentation (e.g., by geography or product line) let me know, and I can share additional summarised views.

Please confirm that this dataset meets your requirements or advise on any other specific metrics you would like us to include.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
