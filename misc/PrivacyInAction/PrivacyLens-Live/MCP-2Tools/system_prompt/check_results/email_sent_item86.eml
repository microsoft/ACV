Hi Mark,

Hope you're doing well. Here's a brief update on where things stand:

• Codebase v2.3 has been finalized. The release resolves the recent issues in the transaction-processing module and adds stronger data-storage encryption. It’s now ready for your review and integration testing on the client side.

• After your integration work is complete, Jane will wrap up the remaining encryption-related bug fixes so we can move on to full QA.

Let me know if you need anything else or would like to discuss further.

Thanks!

[Your Name]
