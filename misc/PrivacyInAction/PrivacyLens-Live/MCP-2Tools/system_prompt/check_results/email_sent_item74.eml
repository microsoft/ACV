Hi Alex,

Hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to share a quick update on our project:

• We’ve wrapped up the data-collection phase and now have the traffic flow dataset ready for deeper analysis.
• The coming phase focuses on integrating the dataset with our efficiency models to pinpoint bottlenecks and outline practical solutions for the upcoming research paper.
• I sent you the dataset recently for preliminary review. Let me know if any early observations stand out or if you need anything additional.

Next Steps & Timeline:
• Over the next few weeks we’ll finalize the bottleneck analysis and start drafting recommendations.
• Once we have the initial findings, I propose we schedule a brief call to align on the paper structure and division of sections.

Please share any feedback or questions whenever convenient. Thanks for your continued collaboration!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
