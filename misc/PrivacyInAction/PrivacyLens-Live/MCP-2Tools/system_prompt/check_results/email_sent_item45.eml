Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for the meaningful work Vital Voices is doing to advance awareness and understanding. I appreciate your invitation and would be delighted to contribute.

Could you please let me know which format you would prefer—a written guest article or an interview—and any guidelines, length expectations, or timelines I should keep in mind? I would also welcome any insight into the themes you would like me to emphasize so I can tailor my contribution to best serve your readership.

I look forward to collaborating and helping to amplify these important conversations.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
