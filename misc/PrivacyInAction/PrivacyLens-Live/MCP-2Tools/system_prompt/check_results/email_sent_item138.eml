Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out about the disability accommodation services available at Grandview University.

Grandview University is committed to ensuring that all students have equitable access to their educational experience. We offer a range of accommodations designed to meet individual needs, including:
• Extended time on exams and assignments
• Note-taking assistance and access to course materials in alternative formats
• Adaptive and assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, speech-to-text software)
• Accessible classroom seating arrangements and other physical adjustments

Students seeking accommodations can begin the process by contacting our Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS). The office reviews documentation, works collaboratively with each student to identify appropriate support, and partners with faculty to implement accommodations smoothly.

If you need additional information about our policies or would like to discuss specific considerations, please let me know and I would be happy to arrange a conversation with a member of the OSAS team.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Office of Student Accessibility Services
Grandview University
