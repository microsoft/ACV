Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a concise checklist of the next steps for the marketing campaign so we keep everything moving smoothly:

1. Finalize the ad copy – aim to wrap this up in the first part of next month. The content team is polishing headlines and CTAs and will circulate a draft for your review.

2. Secure media placements – shoot for confirmations around mid-month. If you need vendor contacts or past rate-card references, just let me know and I’ll forward them.

3. Schedule social-media posts – begin queuing posts so they can start rolling out later in the month once the creative assets are locked.

4. Coordinate with Sales – let’s arrange a brief sync to ensure their outreach messaging aligns with the campaign themes. I’m happy to set up the meeting if helpful.

5. Launch-event prep – the team is drafting the run-of-show and collateral so everything is ready for the product unveiling early next quarter. I’ll keep you posted as soon as the first outline is ready.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you’d like additional detail on any of the above. Always happy to jump on a quick call or share supporting docs.

Thanks and talk soon,
John
