Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out with your questions about how Haven Child Welfare Agency’s Child Protective Services (CPS) team operates. I’m happy to provide a concise overview of our standard procedures and the principal challenges we face.

How a case moves through CPS
1. Intake & Screening – We receive reports from mandated reporters and the public, log essential facts, and conduct an initial risk triage within hours.
2. Assignment – A supervisor assigns the case to a CPS worker who reviews the report, checks prior history, and drafts a preliminary action plan.
3. Initial Safety Assessment – Within the first few days, the worker interviews the child (in a safe setting), speaks with caregivers, contacts schools or medical professionals as needed, and documents any immediate safety concerns.
4. Safety Planning – If risks are verified, we develop a safety plan. Options range from intensive in-home services to temporary out-of-home placement.
5. Ongoing Services & Monitoring – The caseworker coordinates services (counseling, substance-use treatment, parenting programs, etc.) and revisits the family regularly to assess progress.
6. Case Review & Closure – Supervisors review each file periodically. A case is closed only when safety benchmarks are met and support systems are in place.

Key systemic challenges
• High caseloads – Caseworkers routinely juggle several dozen open files, which stretches the time they can devote to each family.
• Resource shortages – Safe foster-care beds, specialized therapeutic programs, and affordable legal representation are all in short supply, slowing permanency planning.
• Workforce strain – The emotional toll of child-protection work contributes to burnout and turnover, creating knowledge gaps and training costs.
• Coordination hurdles – Our success often depends on cooperation among courts, schools, health providers, and law enforcement, all operating on different timelines and mandates.
• Balancing protection & preservation – We must simultaneously prioritize child safety and honor the goal of keeping families intact whenever it can be done safely.
• Data & technology limitations – Legacy systems hinder real-time information-sharing and analytics that could improve decision-making.

Context in numbers (rounded)
Last year we handled a little over 1,200 reports. The average span from intake to case resolution was roughly six months, though timelines vary widely based on case complexity.

I hope this provides a useful foundation. Let me know if you’d like to discuss any aspect in more depth or if you need on-the-record quotes for your piece. I can also help facilitate interviews with program leadership or point you toward publicly available reports.
