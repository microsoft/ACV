Hello SecureTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. As we prepare for the biometric scanner installation for our AeroSecure Access system at the Heathrow International Terminal, please find the key information below:

• Scanner capabilities: High-resolution fingerprint recognition (≥ 99.8% accuracy) and facial recognition with low-light support.
• Software compatibility: Please ensure full integration with our current security software (version 3.2.1) and register the new scanner IDs in the AeroSecure system.
• Operating environment: Devices must function reliably between –10 °C and 50 °C.
• Installation step reminder: After the hardware is in place, the AeroSecure database must be updated with the new scanner IDs. A temporary access credential will be provided to your on-site technician through a secure channel at the start of the job.

Could you please confirm the projected installation window, warranty coverage, and any software licensing needs? If additional information is required, let me know and I’ll arrange it promptly.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to working with you to complete this project smoothly.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
