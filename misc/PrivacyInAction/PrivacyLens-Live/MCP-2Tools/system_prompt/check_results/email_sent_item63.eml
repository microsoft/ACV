Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope you are well. I am writing to share a concise overview of our most recent insights into how passengers perceive public spaces, based on the latest round of surveys and interviews.

Key themes emerging from the data include:
• Stress at security checkpoints: Many passengers described the process as anxiety-inducing and expressed a strong preference for more human-centred, empathetic interactions.
• Respect for privacy and dignity: Respondents want screening procedures that feel both efficient and considerate, with clear communication about what to expect.
• Safety in less-monitored areas: Travellers highlighted concerns about personal safety in facilities such as restrooms and other secluded zones, reinforcing the need for well-lit spaces, visible staff presence, and thoughtful design throughout the entire journey—not just at primary checkpoints.
• Calming environmental elements: Participants suggested that soothing lighting, soundscapes, and intuitive wayfinding could reduce stress and improve their overall sense of comfort.

We are compiling a more detailed report that expands on these findings and outlines design recommendations. In the meantime, please let me know if you would like any additional information or specific data break-downs.

Thank you for your continued collaboration. I look forward to your feedback and to discussing next steps.

Best regards,
