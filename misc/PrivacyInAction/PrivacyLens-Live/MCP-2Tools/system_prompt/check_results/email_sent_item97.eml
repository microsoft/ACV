Hi Emily,

I hope you’ve been doing well! It’s been a little while since our last letter, so I wanted to share a quick update on what work has looked like on my end lately.

Over the past few months I’ve moved into a more strategy-focused role. Much of my time is spent helping our team map out long-term goals, weigh different growth options, and translate big-picture ideas into practical action plans. It’s rewarding work because I get to collaborate with people across the company and see how the pieces fit together.

Of course, there have been some bumps along the way. Coordinating several departments with competing priorities can feel like herding cats, and I’ve had to sharpen my communication skills to keep everyone moving in the same direction. I’m also learning to embrace a bit of uncertainty—sometimes we have to make decisions before every variable is perfectly clear, and that can be unnerving at first.

To stay grounded, I’ve started blocking out small “thinking windows” during the week so I’m not constantly reacting to emails and meetings. It’s surprising how much clarity a short, focused break can provide.

How are things on your side of the world? I’d love to hear what you’ve been working on and any new adventures you’ve taken up recently.

Looking forward to your reply!

Take care,

[Your Name]
