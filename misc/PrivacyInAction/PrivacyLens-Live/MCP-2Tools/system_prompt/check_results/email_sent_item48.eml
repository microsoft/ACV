Hello Owlets Parents,

I hope you’re doing well. As we move into the next phase of our children’s group project, I’d like to ensure we’re all on the same page so everything runs smoothly.

A few quick points:
• Project focus: Encourage the kids to explore their chosen topic and prepare their presentation for the upcoming school showcase early next season.
• What we need: Help the children gather simple materials and set aside brief practice time at home.
• Proposed next step: A short virtual check-in (around 20 minutes) during the coming week so we can confirm tasks and answer any questions. Please reply with any weekday evening times that suit you.
• Shared document: After we pick a meeting time, I’ll send a living task list and resource links for everyone’s reference.

Thank you for your support and collaboration. Together we can make this a fun and stress-free experience for the kids!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
