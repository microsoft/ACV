Hello Selection Syndicate team,

We have completed the latest round of candidate assessments. A concise overview:

• Each candidate took part in technical and behavioral interviews and completed practical exercises.
• Strengths, development areas, and suggested team placements have been outlined for every participant.
• Highlights:
  – Michael Turner: Strong backend developer with extensive experience in Python and Java; excels at structured problem-solving and would be well-suited for roles that require analytical thinking and systematic design.
  – Additional candidates bring complementary expertise in front-end development, data analysis, and systems architecture; detailed notes are available in the shared assessment files.

Next steps:
• Please review the full assessment summaries in the shared workspace.
• Let me know which candidates you would like to move forward to the next stage so we can coordinate scheduling.

Thank you, and please reach out if you need any further information.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
