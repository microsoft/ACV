Hello Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to explore a potential collaboration between our organization and the Active Youth Foundation on a community sports program aimed at engaging local youth in a variety of athletic activities.

I’ve drafted a brief proposal that outlines the program’s objectives—promoting healthy lifestyles, building teamwork, and connecting local schools and sports clubs with community resources. I believe your team’s experience and reach could be invaluable in making this initiative impactful.

I’d love to discuss how we might combine our resources and expertise to bring the program to life. Please let me know a convenient time for a short call or meeting in the coming weeks.

Thank you for considering this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
