Dear Mr. Green,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in tailoring EdTech Innovations’ upcoming learning modules for our students.

I can share a summary of our latest aggregated student performance information, including overall average test scores and participation rates in extracurricular activities. All figures are anonymized and contain no identifying details, ensuring full compliance with our district’s privacy guidelines.

Please let me know if this level of detail meets your needs or if there is a specific format you would prefer. Once confirmed, I can provide the summary through our secure file-sharing channel.

I look forward to collaborating with you.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Lincoln High School
