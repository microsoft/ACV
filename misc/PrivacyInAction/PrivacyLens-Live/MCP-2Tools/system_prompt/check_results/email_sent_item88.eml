Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been reviewing our recent brainstorming notes and wanted to share a few ideas on how we can strengthen our fundraising impact this year.

Key opportunities we’ve identified:
• Encourage recurring giving by making monthly support the default option on campaign pages.
• Enhance donor recognition through timely thank-you messages and public appreciation posts.
• Launch engaging social-media challenges to mobilize younger supporters.
• Host creative virtual or hybrid events, such as:
  – A community fitness challenge or virtual marathon
  – An online concert featuring local talent
  – A neighborhood art auction with proceeds supporting our programs
• Partner with local businesses for matching gifts or in-kind contributions.

I’d love to hear what initiatives Community United is planning and explore how we might collaborate. Would you be available for a short call next week to discuss next steps?

Looking forward to working together.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
