Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to share an initiative we believe aligns closely with the mission of Helping Hands – our “Read to Succeed” program.

About the Program
Read to Succeed is designed for children ages 6–10 and focuses on strengthening early reading skills through engaging, interactive weekly sessions. By pairing quality books with fun group activities, we aim to spark a lifelong love of reading among the students we serve.

Why We’re Touching Base
To make the program as impactful as possible, we’re looking for partners who are passionate about literacy and youth development. There are several ways Helping Hands could get involved, including:
• Providing or sourcing age-appropriate books and materials.
• Supporting volunteer training so our mentors feel prepared and confident.
• Helping us amplify awareness through community outreach and promotional efforts.

Next Steps
I’d love to set up a brief call to explore potential collaboration and answer any questions you might have. Your insight and experience in community programs would be invaluable as we roll this out.

Please let me know if you’d be available for a quick conversation sometime next week. I’m happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
