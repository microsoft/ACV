Hello ConstructCo Solutions Team,

I’m excited to begin our collaboration on the new project. Based on our earlier discussions, the main objectives are to:

• Clarify the scope and deliverables
• Agree on a high-level timeline
• Align on communication channels and points of contact

To move forward efficiently, could you please share:
1. The names and roles of your core project team members.
2. Any initial questions or feedback on the draft scope I sent previously.
3. Your availability for a brief virtual kickoff call early next week.

I will circulate the latest project overview and proposed timeline in a separate message so we can enter the call ready to confirm next steps and milestones.

Thank you, and I look forward to working together.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Company]
