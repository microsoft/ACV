Hi Tom,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to share a brief status update on our community and on Path to Sobriety’s recent activities:

• Community engagement continues to grow. Attendance at our weekly support meetings has increased noticeably over the past several weeks, showing stronger participation and interest.

• Over the last month Path to Sobriety has:
  – Connected individually with dozens of community members who expressed interest in recovery resources.
  – Hosted several substance-abuse awareness workshops that were well received by participants and local partners.
  – Helped a number of new participants begin their rehabilitation journeys, reflecting steady program impact.

Overall, momentum is positive, and community response remains encouraging. I’ll keep you posted as we move forward and scale further outreach.

Thank you for your ongoing support and collaboration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
