Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’ve been well. I’m currently working on an ongoing matter and would appreciate your perspective on several strategic points that have come up.

Would you be willing to share your thoughts? I can provide a concise brief or arrange a brief call—whichever is more convenient for you.

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance.

Best regards,
Jane
