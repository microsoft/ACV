Dear Mark,

Thank you for your follow-up. Below is an overview of Union Trust Bank’s customer dispute-resolution framework.

1. Initiating a claim
   • Customers may file a dispute through our online portal, by phone, or at any branch. A reference number is automatically generated so they can track progress.

2. Preliminary review
   • A specialist reviews the claim to confirm we have sufficient information to proceed and will request any supplementary documentation that may be required (for example, a copy of the transaction detail or relevant correspondence).

3. Investigation & merchant contact
   • Once a claim is validated, our team contacts the merchant and the card network to gather their response and supporting evidence.

4. Evaluation & decision
   • After reviewing all materials, we determine the appropriate outcome in accordance with card-network rules and consumer-protection regulations.

5. Communication & remediation
   • We inform the customer of the decision and, when applicable, issue a provisional or final credit to the account.

Typical timelines
• Claims are acknowledged within one business day of receipt.
• Most investigations are completed within a few weeks; more complex cases that require additional documentation from external parties can take longer. Customers receive periodic status updates throughout.

Required documentation
• In most cases, the initial claim form plus proof of the transaction (e.g., a statement copy) is sufficient. If additional items become necessary, we provide clear instructions and a secure upload portal.

Recent updates
• Over the past year we have enhanced the online portal to improve status visibility and introduced additional training for our merchant-response team to shorten investigation times.

I hope this helps clarify our process for your article. I’m happy to discuss further or arrange a call if that would be useful.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
