Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference. I enjoyed our conversation about emerging tech trends and wanted to share a quick recap and a few resources:

• Artificial Intelligence – Recent advances in generative models are opening new possibilities for content creation and automation.
• Quantum Computing – Industry milestones are signaling that practical applications may arrive sooner than expected, especially in optimization and materials research.
• Blockchain – Enterprises are experimenting with distributed-ledger solutions for supply-chain transparency and digital identity.

I’d be happy to dive deeper into any of these areas and explore how they might influence your current projects. Let me know if you’d be available for a brief call next week to discuss further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Jane
