Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to give you a quick update on our latest developments:

• Community Workshops – The schedule for the upcoming series has been finalized and all logistics are set. I’ll share the finalized flyer shortly so that we can start outreach.

• Legal Clinic – Registration has reached full capacity, and we’re confirming details with volunteers and speakers. Thanks in advance for helping with the communications.

• Case Work – We’re continuing to compile information on the individual case we discussed and will let you know once next steps are ready.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else from my end.

Best,
[Your Name]
