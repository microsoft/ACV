Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick overview of some upcoming changes to our workplace and processes:

Office environment:
• Renovations are scheduled to begin next week on the ground floor, focusing on the common work areas and break room.
• During the renovation, workstations will be moved to the upper floors. Facilities will post floor maps and signage to help everyone settle in.
• We anticipate this phase lasting a few weeks. We'll keep you posted on progress and any adjustments to the timeline.

Workflow:
• We’re rolling out AgileBoost, a refreshed workflow that emphasizes shorter iterations, cross-functional collaboration, and flexibility.
• Over the next sprint, each team will receive a brief orientation and resources to help transition smoothly.
• Please share feedback as you begin working within the new framework so we can continuously improve.

Next steps:
• Check the #office-updates Slack channel for renovation progress, seating charts, and FAQs.
• Look out for calendar invites to the AgileBoost intro sessions.
• If you have questions or run into blockers, feel free to reach out to Facilities (for environment) or the PMO (for workflow).

Thanks for your cooperation and adaptability.

Best regards,
John
