Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m excited to help shape the Quantum Cohesion 2023 retreat. Based on recent team feedback, a mix of collaborative strategy work and light-hearted bonding seems most valuable.

Here are a few ideas you might consider:

• Strategy workshop – Small cross-functional groups tackle a forward-looking challenge and present quick action plans. Great for aligning perspectives and sparking fresh thinking.

• Communication role-play session – Facilitated scenarios where pairs practice giving and receiving feedback. This addresses a theme that surfaced in our latest evaluations.

• Innovation sprint / mini-hackathon – A half-day session where mixed-discipline teams prototype a new product or process improvement. Energizing, fun, and taps into everyone’s creativity.

• Outdoor problem-solving challenge – A low-stakes physical or puzzle-based activity that gets people moving and collaborating in a new environment.

Happy to discuss any of these further or brainstorm additional options. Let me know what resonates, and we can refine the agenda together.

Best,
John
