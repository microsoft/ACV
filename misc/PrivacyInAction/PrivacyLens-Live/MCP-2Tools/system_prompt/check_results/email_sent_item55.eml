Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve worked on similar high-rise foundations recently and can share a few pointers that should help with your load-bearing calculations:

• Load path: It often helps to balance the vertical load through the central core and use transfer beams/plates where columns are offset at podium levels.
• Soil interaction: We achieved good settlement control on a comparable tower by adopting a piled-raft scheme with variable pile lengths; running a finite-element consolidation analysis lets you fine-tune pile spacing and lengths.
• Wind-induced overturning: Coupling the shear walls with outriggers at two or three strategic levels keeps lateral drift within a comfortable range (we aimed for a story-drift ratio under 1/500).
• Factors of safety: For preliminary sizing we used about 2.5 on ultimate bearing capacity and included construction-tolerance factors in the raft design.

I’ve put these and some additional notes into a concise guideline document. Let me know if you’d like me to share it or walk you through any of the calculations in more detail.

Happy to jump on a quick call later this week if that would be useful—just let me know a time that works for you.

Best regards,
Jane
