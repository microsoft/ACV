Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well!

I wanted to share a brief update on what our team has been up to and give you a preview of the community charity event planned for mid-March:

• Planning progress – We’ve finalized the overall outline for the day, which will focus on community-service and engagement activities across several stations (interactive booths, short workshops, and hands-on projects).

• Volunteers – Parish members and local residents have started signing up, and we’re continuing outreach to ensure we have plenty of helping hands. If your network knows anyone who’d like to participate, we’d love to have them.

• Transparency – We’re implementing clear, well-documented processes for handling all donations and expenses to keep everything above board and easy to track.

Potential collaboration with Helping Hands
• Co-hosting or sponsoring one of the activity stations (for example, a health-check kiosk or a children’s craft corner).
• Sharing volunteer opportunities with your mailing list or social channels.
• Any logistical advice or lessons learned from events you’ve run would be incredibly helpful.

Would you have time for a quick call next week to discuss how we can partner? Let me know what works best for you.

Thank you for all that you and Helping Hands do for the community. Looking forward to working together!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
