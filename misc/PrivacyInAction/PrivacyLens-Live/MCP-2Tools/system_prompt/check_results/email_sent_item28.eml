Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out.

Ethan’s recent absences were due to a brief health matter that required him to rest at home. He is recovering well and is expected to return shortly, provided he continues to feel comfortable.

To help him stay on track, could you please share any key classwork or assignments he should prioritize? I will make sure he catches up over the coming days and will keep you updated on his progress.

If the school requires any further documentation, just let me know and I will provide it promptly.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
