Hi Alex,

Thank you for your thoughtful note and for your interest in Serenity Path. It’s always encouraging to connect with people who are passionate about supporting addiction-recovery initiatives.

A quick overview of what we do:
• Whole-person approach – We combine evidence-based clinical care with mindfulness, peer support, and family engagement so that clients address the physical, psychological, and social dimensions of addiction.
• Flexible programs – Options range from residential treatment to outpatient groups, individual therapy sessions, and family counseling. This allows us to tailor care to each person’s stage of recovery and day-to-day realities.
• Collaborative care – Licensed therapists, recovery coaches, and medical professionals work as an integrated team, staying in close contact with clients even after formal treatment ends.
• Measurable outcomes – Over the past year, a large majority of participants have maintained sobriety after completing treatment, and we continuously refine our curriculum based on what the data tell us.

If it might be helpful, I can share a short slide deck that outlines our model in more detail, or arrange a brief call so we can dig into any aspects that resonate with you—whether that’s program design, technology enablement, or potential collaboration opportunities.

Let me know what would be most useful, and we can set something up.

Warm regards,
John
Serenity Path
