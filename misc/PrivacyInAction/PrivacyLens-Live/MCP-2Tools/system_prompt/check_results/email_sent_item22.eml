Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you. Happy to share some high-level procedural pointers that I’ve found consistently useful:

• Double-check you have the most recent version of the local rules—briefing schedules and formatting requirements are updated more often than people expect.
• Work backward from the projected hearing date to map service, opposition, and reply deadlines. A simple checklist or timeline avoids last-minute surprises.
• Complete and document a meet-and-confer before filing; several judges will strike motions if the certification isn’t crystal clear.
• If your jurisdiction allows, include an index of authorities or table of citations. It makes life easier for clerks and signals thorough preparation.
• Keep the notice of motion tight and the memorandum focused on two or three primary arguments; supporting details can live in a declaration or appendix.
• Assume the court will skim the first pages first—lead with the precise relief sought and a one-sentence rationale.
• Draft a proposed order that mirrors the relief language word-for-word so it can be adopted without edits.

I hope these guidelines are helpful. Let me know if you’d like to talk through anything in greater depth.

Best regards,
Jane
