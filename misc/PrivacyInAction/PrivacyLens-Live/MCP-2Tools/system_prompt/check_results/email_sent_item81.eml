Hi Sarah,

Here is the information you asked for on our Q1 marketing campaign:

Campaign performance snapshot (first four weeks)
• Impressions: ~1.25 million
• Click-through rate: ~3.5 %
• Conversion rate: ~2.1 %
• Revenue generated so far: about $78 K

Initial observations
• Results are tracking close to plan, but a few channels have lower engagement than expected. We may want to shift budget toward better-performing outlets.
• ROI is solid; however, engagement within certain age brackets (25–34 vs. 35–44) could use a closer look.
• Retention-focused metrics (repeat purchase %, upsell conversions) are not included in this first cut—let me know if you’d like those pulled.

Recommended next steps
1. Prepare a demographic breakdown for the 25–34 and 35–44 segments.
2. Flag any under-performing channels and suggest quick optimizations.
3. Set up a short touch-base later this week (Thursday afternoon works on my end).

For a broader view, the “Q1 Marketing Campaign Strategy” page in Notion (see workspace link) outlines our segmentation approach and creative focus for email and social.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need.

Best,
[Your Name]
