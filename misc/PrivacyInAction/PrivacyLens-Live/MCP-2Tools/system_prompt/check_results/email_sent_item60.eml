Dear Oakwood Alumni Reunion Committee,

I hope you are all doing well as we continue preparations for the upcoming reunion. I wanted to share a brief roundup of recent alumni highlights and reminders pulled together from our internal tracker:

Alumni Spotlights
• John Smith (’05) has been promoted to Director of Marketing at Innotech Solutions.
• Emily Johnson (’05) recently released her second novel, which has already been shortlisted for a national literary award.
• Mark Lee (’10) launched a new technology venture that has secured significant early-stage investment.
• Lisa Ray (’10) reports that her nonprofit has expanded its educational outreach to several new countries.

Community Events & Key Dates
• Our annual Oakwood Charity Gala will take place in mid-June where a number of alumni will be recognized for their service.
• A friendly reminder that scholarship applications for our Alumni Fund close in late April. Please encourage potential applicants to submit any remaining materials soon.

Next Steps
Please let me know if you would like further detail on any of the above or additional data pulled before we finalize reunion materials. Otherwise, I’ll continue to circulate periodic summaries as new information arrives.

Thank you for your continued work on making this year’s reunion a success.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
