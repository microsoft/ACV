Hello,

I hope you’re well.

As discussed, please find below a concise overview of the Performance Tracking System (PTS) we’re planning for Acme Corp so your team can begin mapping the technical approach and schedule.

Key Requirements
• Real-time performance metrics displaying KPIs such as project completion progress, sales target attainment, and customer service responsiveness.
• Customizable dashboards that allow each user to highlight the metrics most relevant to their role.
• HRIS integration to unify training records, role changes, and performance review metadata within the PTS.

Proposed Timeline
• Development kick-off: early next quarter.
• Pilot phase: approximately six months after kick-off to refine features based on user feedback.

Next Steps
1. Please confirm that the above aligns with your understanding of the project scope.
2. Let me know if you need any additional information or technical documentation.
3. Kindly provide an updated statement of work and a high-level project schedule at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your collaboration, and I look forward to working together on this initiative.

Best regards,
