Hi Sarah,

Thanks for your note—I’m excited to support the campaign.

Below is a concise snapshot of recent customer behaviour and preferences that may help shape the creative and channel strategy:

1. Mobile-First Younger Segment (approx. 18–30)
   • We continue to see double-digit month-over-month growth in mobile banking usage (just over 20% last month).
   • Popular actions: mobile cheque deposit, online bill pay and peer-to-peer transfers.
   • Suggested creative angle: emphasise speed, 24/7 convenience and easy money-management tools.

2. Relationship-Focused Middle Segment (approx. 40–55)
   • Branch visits rose roughly 15% over the same period.
   • These customers highlight friendly, informed staff as a key differentiator and often ask for extended weekend hours.
   • Suggested creative angle: spotlight personal service, trust and access to knowledgeable advisors; consider promotions tied to in-branch consultations.

3. Growth Opportunity Segment (approx. 30–45)
   • This group drove the largest share of new account openings last quarter.
   • Products drawing attention include high-yield savings and automated budgeting tools.
   • Suggested creative angle: position the bank as a partner in achieving medium-term financial goals.

4. Pain-Points & Quick Wins
   • Some users have reported intermittent glitches when moving funds between internal accounts via the app.
   • Several customers would like a more detailed transaction history within the app for easier spending analysis.
   • Addressing these items in product messaging (or release notes) could reinforce a customer-centric narrative.

Summary
Co-ordinated messaging that pairs mobile convenience with human expertise appears to resonate across segments: “digital when you want it, personal when you need it.” If helpful, I can pull deeper dives on specific geographies or product lines—just let me know.

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best regards,
John
