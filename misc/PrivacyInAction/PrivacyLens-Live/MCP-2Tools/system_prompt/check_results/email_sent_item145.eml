Dear Professor Harrison,

Thank you for your message and for opening a dialogue about student engagement. I share your interest in ensuring our courses remain intellectually stimulating and inclusive.

Below are a few practices that have yielded noticeable improvements in participation and overall energy in my recent classes:

• Start with a probing question – Framing each session around a thought-provoking prompt encourages students to connect prior knowledge to the day’s material from the outset.

• Anchor theory in real-world cases – Brief examples drawn from current events or industry practice help students see relevance and, in turn, volunteer their own observations more readily.

• Rotate discussion leadership – Allowing small groups or individual students to guide short segments of the conversation gives them ownership and builds confidence.

Informally, these approaches have led to livelier discussions, more consistent attendance, and stronger peer-to-peer support. I am currently gathering more systematic feedback and would be happy to share aggregate observations once the semester wraps up.

If you are exploring similar initiatives, I would welcome the chance to compare notes or collaborate on a small pilot across our sections.

Thank you again for initiating this exchange, and please let me know how I can support your efforts.

Best regards,
Jane
