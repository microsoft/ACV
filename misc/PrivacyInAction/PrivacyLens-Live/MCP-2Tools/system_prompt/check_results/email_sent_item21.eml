Hi Alex,

Thank you for the time and effort you put into your recent project. Your work shows a strong grasp of the key concepts we have been covering, and the data analysis you performed was thorough and clearly presented. The visualizations you included were particularly effective in illustrating your findings and made your argument easy to follow.

As you continue refining this project (or as you move on to future work), I encourage you to focus on sharpening the wording of your hypothesis. A concise, clearly stated research question will help guide the reader and make the overall narrative even more compelling.

If you would like to discuss any of these points in greater detail, feel free to reach out and we can set up a quick meeting.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
