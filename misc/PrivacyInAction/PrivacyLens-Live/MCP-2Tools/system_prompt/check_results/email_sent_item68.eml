Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share a quick update on this year’s admissions cycle:

• Interest continues to climb – applications rose modestly to just over fifteen thousand.
• Selectivity remains high, with offers extended to roughly one in fourteen applicants.
• The incoming class is our most academically accomplished yet, with average standardized scores in the high-1400s (SAT) / low-30s (ACT).
• We’re also welcoming students from more than sixty countries, adding wonderful depth to the community’s diversity.

It’s shaping up to be an energetic, talented cohort, and we’re already planning a range of orientation and mentorship activities to help them settle in.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to get involved with alumni outreach for the new class.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
