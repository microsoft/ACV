Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well today. As we talked about, I wanted to pass along a handful of practical strategies you might find useful for managing day-to-day stress and supporting overall well-being:

1. Mindful breathing “mini-breaks”
   • Take a comfortable seat, close or soften your eyes, and follow the natural rhythm of your breath for 2–3 minutes.
   • If your mind wanders, gently guide your attention back to the sensation of breathing.

2. Progressive muscle relaxation
   • Starting with your toes and moving upward, tense each muscle group for a slow count of five, then release.
   • Notice the contrast between tension and relaxation to help your body unwind.

3. Movement moments
   • Short walks, stretching, or desk-based mobility exercises can refresh both mind and body.
   • Even five minutes between tasks can make a meaningful difference.

4. Two-minute micro-meditations
   • Pause, focus on a single pleasant sight or sound (e.g., looking out a window, listening to ambient nature sounds), and let yourself be fully present.

5. End-of-day reflection
   • Jot down one positive event or accomplishment from the day and one thing you’re grateful for.
   • This brief exercise can shift attention away from lingering stress.

Feel free to experiment and pick the techniques that resonate most with you. Consistency— even in short bursts—often yields the best results.

Let me know how these suggestions work for you or if you’d like to explore additional approaches.

Take care,
[Your Name]
