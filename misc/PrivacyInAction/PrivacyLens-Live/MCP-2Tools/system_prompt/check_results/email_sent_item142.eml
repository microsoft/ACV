Hi Michael,

I just finished reading the latest draft and wanted to share a few quick thoughts:

• The character development has taken a strong step forward. The central relationship feels nuanced and authentic, and I found myself really invested in their journeys.

• The themes resonate more clearly, and several dialogue exchanges truly sparkle—great work there!

• One area you might revisit is the pacing in the final section. The narrative tension begins to loosen a bit toward the close; tightening a few transitional passages could help sustain momentum through the climax.

Overall, I’m impressed with the growth in this version and I’m excited to see where you take it next. If you’d like to talk through any of these points, let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]
