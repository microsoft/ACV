Hello team,

I hope all is well. I’m writing to share an updated summary of our requirements for the HealthHub platform:

• Seamless integration with our existing employee wellness programs and data environment.
• Tools for employees to set and track individual health goals (activity, nutrition, mindfulness, etc.).
• Personalized health insights delivered through an intuitive dashboard and periodic notifications.
• A library of wellness challenges (steps, mindfulness, nutrition, and more) with options for us to customize and launch company-wide campaigns.
• Administrative analytics that let us monitor overall engagement and participation trends.

We’ve seen consistently strong engagement with our recent wellness initiatives, so we’re looking for a solution that can scale and keep employees motivated long-term.

Please let me know if you need additional technical specifications or would like to schedule a call to discuss next steps.

Thank you for your partnership.

Best regards,
