Dear Emily,

It’s always wonderful to hear from you! Thank you for your thoughtful note and for wanting to learn more about the impact of my team’s work.

Just recently we ran a community workshop that focused on practical coping strategies for individuals in addiction recovery. It combined short presentations with hands-on activities so participants could practice new skills right away. In the follow-up survey most attendees told us they now feel noticeably more confident about staying on track and managing potential relapse triggers.

One comment that really touched me came from a participant who said the workshop helped them realise they’re not alone and gave them concrete tools they could start using that same day. Feedback like that keeps our whole team motivated.

We’re now gearing up for a series of shorter, drop-in sessions to help people keep building on what they learned. I’m excited to see how this ongoing support will continue to make a difference.

Enough about me—how are things with you? I’d love to hear what’s been happening in your world lately.

Warm regards,
Jane
