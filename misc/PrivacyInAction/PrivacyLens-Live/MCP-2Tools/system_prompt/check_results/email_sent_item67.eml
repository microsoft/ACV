Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope you are well. I am writing to give you a concise update on our department’s compliance status.

• Policy Alignment: We reviewed the recent updates to international-student regulations and confirmed that our current procedures remain fully aligned.
• Faculty Awareness: All instructors have been briefed on the changes and provided with updated guidance materials.
• Documentation: Required records and checklists have been refreshed and are stored in our shared repository for easy reference.
• Ongoing Monitoring: We will continue to track any future policy revisions and schedule refresher sessions as needed.

Please let me know if you would like any additional details or supporting documents.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
