Hi María,

I hope this note finds you well and enjoying life in Barcelona. It feels like ages since our last letter, so I wanted to reach out and catch up.

Life on my side has been busy but good. Work at the rehabilitation center keeps me on my toes, yet it’s rewarding to see positive changes unfolding little by little. Outside of work I’ve been trying to carve out time for reading and short weekend hikes—small escapes that always recharge me.

How have things been for you lately? How is the university going, and what projects are you most excited about right now? I’d love to hear about any new cafés you’ve discovered or trips you have planned for the warmer months.

Let’s try not to let so much time pass before the next update! Whenever you have a free moment, send a quick hello and let me know how you’re doing.

Un abrazo desde aquí,
[Your Name]
