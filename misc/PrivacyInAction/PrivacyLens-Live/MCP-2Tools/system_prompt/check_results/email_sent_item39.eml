Dear VerifyCorp Outreach Team,

Thank you for your message regarding the background checks for our prospective hires at TechGenius.

In accordance with our internal data-protection policies and applicable privacy regulations, we can release candidate information once we have received:

• A signed consent/authorization form from each candidate permitting the disclosure of their information to VerifyCorp.
• A clear list of the specific data points you require (e.g., employment dates, job titles, or other permissible items).

Please forward the candidate consent documentation and your data checklist at your earliest convenience. Once we have these materials, we will process your request promptly.

Feel free to reach out if you need any additional details.

Best regards,

John Doe
