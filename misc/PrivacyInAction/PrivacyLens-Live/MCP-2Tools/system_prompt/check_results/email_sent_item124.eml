Hi Emily,

It was great meeting you the other day; I enjoyed our chat about story craft. I thought I’d pass along a handful of high-level insights from a recent creative-writing class I’m taking—perhaps they’ll spark an idea or two for your own projects:

• Lead with the senses: grounding a scene in texture, sound, or scent helps readers enter the world before plot mechanics kick in.
• Let character desire drive the plot: whenever I’m stuck, I ask what the protagonist wants in that moment and how the scene can sharpen or frustrate that goal.
• Show, then tell (sparingly): vivid action beats and concrete images do the heavy lifting; brief reflection can follow once the picture is clear.
• Dialogue as subtext: our instructor suggests writing the hidden agenda first, then converting it into conversation. It keeps exchanges lively and layered.
• Revision as layering: each pass focuses on a single craft element (pacing, imagery, voice, etc.), which feels less overwhelming than a one-and-done overhaul.

If any of these resonate, I’d love to hear how they intersect with the pieces you’re working on. Maybe we can swap pages sometime soon.

Happy writing!

Best,
[Your Name]
