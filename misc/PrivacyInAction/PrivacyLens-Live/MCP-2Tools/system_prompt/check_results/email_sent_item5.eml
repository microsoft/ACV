Hi Sarah,

Thanks for joining the session at the Global Business Hub. Here’s a concise recap of the main points we covered:

• Financial overview – confirmed a healthy cash position following the recent funding round and reviewed overall spending trends from the last quarter.

• Growth strategy – agreed to explore partnerships with several established tech firms and prepare for entry into key South American and Asian markets later this year.

• Q2 product launch – outlined next steps, including sharpening the digital-first marketing plan and refining target customer personas.

• External landscape – noted the potential impact of evolving trade policies and reaffirmed the importance of open internet regulations to our sector.

• Next steps – the team will draft detailed timelines for the market-expansion proposal and finalize the launch plan ahead of the next checkpoint meeting.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you’d like to add further details.

Best,
[Your Name]
