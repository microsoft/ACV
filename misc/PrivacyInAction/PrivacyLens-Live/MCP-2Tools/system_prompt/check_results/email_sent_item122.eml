Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m reaching out from SecureNow Insurance because we’re eager to explore a collaboration with Helping Hands Charity. We believe that by combining our resources and expertise we can create a program that offers timely assistance and long-term support to families impacted by natural disasters.

I’d love to share our ideas and hear your thoughts on how we might work together. Would you be available for a brief call sometime next week to discuss opportunities and next steps?

Looking forward to connecting.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
