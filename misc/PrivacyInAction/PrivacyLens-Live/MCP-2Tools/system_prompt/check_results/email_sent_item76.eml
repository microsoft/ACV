Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well.

Here’s a brief update on our project:

• We remain on track, with all current milestones completed as scheduled.
• Core functionality has been integrated into the platform and is now in final testing; no major issues have been identified.
• Our upcoming focus is on finalising documentation and preparing training materials for the client workshop.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
