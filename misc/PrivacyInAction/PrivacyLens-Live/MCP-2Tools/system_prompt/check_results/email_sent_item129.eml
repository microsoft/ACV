Hi Mark,

I hope you're well.

I wanted to share a brief update on the two clients we’re jointly supporting:

• Emily – She continues to attend sessions regularly and is showing steady progress. She’s exploring ways to engage with the community through volunteer opportunities, which seems to be helping maintain her positive momentum.

• Thomas – He’s been actively participating in group work and often offers encouragement to peers. While he still has occasional moments of uncertainty, the overall direction remains positive and he is building confidence.

I’ll continue to monitor their progress and will keep you informed of any significant developments. Please let me know if there’s anything else you need or if there are additional supports Beacon of Hope would like us to coordinate.

Best regards,
