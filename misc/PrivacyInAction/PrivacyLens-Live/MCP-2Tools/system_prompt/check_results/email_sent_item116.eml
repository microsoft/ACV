Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out.

The upcoming exam will focus on three main areas:

• Fundamental cryptography concepts — understanding how different encryption approaches compare and when each is appropriate.
• Ethical and legal impacts of data breaches on both individuals and organizations.
• Evaluating and justifying cybersecurity safeguards in practical scenarios.

Be sure to review the related lecture notes, case studies, and assigned readings. If you can clearly explain these concepts in your own words and apply them to new situations, you will be well prepared.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Professor Doe
