Hi Alex,

Hope you’re doing well. As requested, below is a concise outline of the key technical specifications from the IT side so that Marketing and IT stay aligned on the cross-departmental project.

1. Data Integration
   • A secure REST API (JSON) will be used for daily data exchanges between Marketing’s analytics platform and the central data warehouse.
   • All traffic will be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest.
   • Authentication is handled via service accounts with rotating tokens (SSO-compliant).

2. Data Schema & Volume
   • Primary tables: campaign_overview, customer_events, attribution_metrics.
   • Expected daily volume: ~2 GB compressed; retention target: 24 months in the warehouse.
   • Identifiers are pseudonymised before they leave source systems to meet internal privacy standards.

3. Analytics Platform Connection
   • IT will expose a pre-built connector for InSight360 (the analytics tool Marketing selected).
   • Initial load will be performed in a staging environment; after validation, a promotion script moves assets to production.

4. Security & Compliance
   • Role-based access controls map to Marketing-Analyst, Marketing-Manager and Admin profiles.
   • All queries are audited; logs retained for 12 months.
   • The solution complies with our internal Data Protection Policy (ref. DP-3.1).

5. Environments & Timeline
   • Staging resources are available now; production cut-over is planned for early next quarter, pending user acceptance testing.
   • A change-control ticket will be submitted one week before go-live.

6. Support & Next Steps
   • Dedicated IT contact: systems-integration@tritondefense.com
   • Please let me know if you’d like a brief walkthrough; I’m happy to set up a joint call next week.

Let me know if anything needs clarification or if you have additional requirements.

Looking forward to moving this ahead together.

Best,
Jane
