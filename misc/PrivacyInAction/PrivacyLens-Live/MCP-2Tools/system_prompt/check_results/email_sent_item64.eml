Hi Sarah,

Welcome to the team – I’m glad to have you on board.

I wanted to give you a brief, high-level overview of where our key matters stand so you can hit the ground running:

• In one of our flagship cases, the team recently uncovered new evidence that could meaningfully shift our litigation strategy. We are in the process of reassessing arguments and timelines to make the most of this development.

• Supporting materials, including witness-related documents, have been uploaded to the secure workspace. Please let me know if you need access credentials or have any trouble locating them.

• We’ll hold an internal briefing shortly so you can meet the broader team and walk through the revised game plan together. I’ll circulate a proposed time once everyone’s calendars are checked.

If there’s anything you need in the meantime, just let me know. Looking forward to collaborating.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
