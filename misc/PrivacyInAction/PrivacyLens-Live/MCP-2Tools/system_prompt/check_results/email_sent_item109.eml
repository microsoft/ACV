Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve been reviewing our recent engagement metrics and a few themes stand out that could guide the next round of UI improvements:

• Average session length has risen by roughly 15% over the past quarter, suggesting that users are willing to explore more when navigation feels intuitive.
• The revamped onboarding tutorial boosted early–stage retention by about 20%, so clear, guided first-time experiences seem to pay off.
• Users most frequently visit account-related areas—particularly Settings and Security—so surfacing these options more prominently (or adding quick-access shortcuts) could streamline their workflows.

A couple of low-friction ideas to consider:
1. Place key actions (profile, settings, help) in a consistent, always-visible header to reduce search time.
2. Use progressive disclosure to keep advanced options available without overwhelming new users.
3. Provide concise, actionable feedback when an operation fails (e.g., login or data sync). Our debugging notes show that clear error messaging tends to reduce support tickets.

If you’d like to dig deeper into any of these points or run a short design critique together, just let me know a convenient time. Happy to collaborate with the broader team.

Best,
Jane
