Hi Sarah,

I hope you're well. I've recently reviewed my students' participation in the "Read to Succeed" initiative and wanted to share some observations that may help as you refine program resources:

• Impact so far: Across my class, average reading-comprehension performance has risen by roughly 15% and I've seen noticeable growth in their critical thinking and discussion skills.

• Current challenges:
  – Access gaps: A number of students still have limited exposure to a variety of age-appropriate, high-interest texts (e.g., culturally diverse stories, nonfiction, graphic novels).
  – Individual needs: Some learners would benefit from more personalized reading paths that pair texts with their interests and current skill levels.

• Possible next steps:
  – Build a rotating library box or digital shelf with genre-diverse titles from partner publishers or local libraries.
  – Offer short "choice reading" periods each week where students select materials aligned with their goals.
  – Create quick-check comprehension trackers so teachers can adapt reading lists in real time.
  – Invite volunteer mentors to host small-group read-alouds or virtual book chats.

I'm happy to discuss any of these ideas further or pilot new materials in my classroom. Thank you for all the work Bright Futures Foundation does to foster literacy growth.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
