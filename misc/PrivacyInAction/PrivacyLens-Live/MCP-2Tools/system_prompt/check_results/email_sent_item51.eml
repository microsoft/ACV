Dear Sunny Days families,

We hope you’re having a wonderful week! We’re excited to share a few highlights from recent classroom life:

• Collaborative Mural Project
  The children teamed up to create a colorful mural that celebrates friendship and teamwork. Their creativity and cooperation were inspiring, and the finished piece brightens up our common area. Feel free to ask your child about the part they contributed—the stories are priceless!

• Strengthening Connections – Buddy System Coming Soon
  To continue nurturing positive peer relationships, we will soon be launching a simple “Buddy System.” Children will be paired with classmates to encourage support, empathy, and inclusiveness in daily activities. We’ll share more details and ways you can reinforce these values at home in the next update.

Thank you for your ongoing support of our programs. If you have any questions, please reach out.

Warm regards,
Sunny Days Childcare Team
