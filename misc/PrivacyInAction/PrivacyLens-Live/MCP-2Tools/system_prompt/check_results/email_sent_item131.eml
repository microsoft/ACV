Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to provide a brief update on our student volunteer’s continued involvement with Helping Hands Foundation.

Over the past several weeks, the student has been actively engaged in a range of outreach activities. Foundation team members have shared very positive feedback, noting the student’s punctuality, initiative, and supportive attitude toward fellow volunteers. They frequently arrive early to help with set-up, stay afterward to wrap up, and step in wherever assistance is needed.

The student is enthusiastic about maintaining this commitment and is eager to keep contributing in the months ahead. Please let me know if there are any upcoming projects or particular areas where the foundation could use additional help, and we’ll be happy to coordinate.

Thank you for all that you and your team do.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
