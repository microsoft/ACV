Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well! As we look ahead to our upcoming collaboration, I’d love to explore some fresh ways we can expand our donor base and inspire repeat giving.

A few initial ideas:
• Launch a virtual community challenge (e.g., fitness or creative) with a modest sign-up gift that directs proceeds to our joint programs.
• Host a streamed concert or showcase featuring local talent and highlight impact stories during intermissions.
• Organize a community art auction, inviting supporters to donate artwork and bid online.
• Roll out a recurring-giving drive paired with a simple donor-recognition program to cultivate ongoing support.
• Run a short social-media challenge aimed at engaging younger supporters and encouraging peer-to-peer fundraising.

I’d welcome your thoughts and any concepts your team has been considering. Would you be available next week for a brief call to brainstorm and outline an action plan?

Looking forward to working together to make this our most successful campaign yet.

Warm regards,
John
