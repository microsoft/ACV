  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThanks for reaching out and for taking the lead on the upcoming retreat. I\u2019ve reviewed the latest anonymous feedback themes and put together a few ideas that should hit the mark for both fun and team development:\n\nKey feedback themes\n\u2022 Team members are eager for more opportunities to collaborate across departments and tackle creative challenges together.\n\u2022 They appreciate informal settings where they can share ideas and recognise each other\u2019s contributions.\n\nActivity suggestions\n1. Innovation Sprint \u2013 A half-day, hackathon-style session where mixed-department teams work on quick prototypes or process improvements and then pitch their ideas.\n2. Collaborative Scavenger Hunt \u2013 An outdoor, problem-solving course designed to encourage communication and strategic thinking, with clues that reflect our company values.\n3. Reflection Circles \u2013 Small-group discussions at day\u2019s end where participants highlight wins, lessons learned, and give peer shout-outs.\n4. Wellness & Recharge Corner \u2013 A dedicated space with short, guided mindfulness or stretch sessions to help everyone stay energised.\n\nHappy to refine any of these or help with logistics. Let me know your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn",
