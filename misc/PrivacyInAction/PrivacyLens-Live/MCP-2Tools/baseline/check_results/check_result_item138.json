  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Thompson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to confirm Grandview University\u2019s adherence to federal disability-accommodation regulations. I appreciate the opportunity to outline our current practices and resources.\n\nOverview of Our Accommodation Framework\n\u2022 Governance \u2013 All disability accommodations are administered through the Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS). OSAS reviews documentation, determines reasonable accommodations, and issues formal letters to students and instructors.\n\u2022 Range of Supports \u2013 Common accommodations include extended exam time, distraction-reduced testing spaces, note-taking assistance, captioned or sign-language-interpreted lectures, accessible digital materials that meet WCAG standards, adjustable-height workstations, and adaptive software or devices.\n\u2022 Faculty Coordination \u2013 Instructors receive an accommodation letter at the start of each term and are required to meet all listed adjustments. The Center for Teaching Excellence runs ongoing faculty workshops on creating accessible course content and classroom environments.\n\u2022 Monitoring & Review \u2013 Compliance is monitored jointly by OSAS and the Provost\u2019s Office through mid-term check-ins, periodic syllabus audits, and an annual policy review aligned with Section 504 and ADAAA guidance.\n\u2022 Appeals Process \u2013 Students may appeal accommodation decisions through a committee chaired by the Dean of Students, ensuring due process and timely resolution.\n\nRecent Enhancements\n\u2022 We updated our Learning Management System templates this year to improve screen-reader navigation and add automatic captioning for uploaded media.\n\u2022 A new campus-wide procurement checklist now requires all academic software vendors to provide VPAT documentation before purchase approval.\n\nRequested Documentation\nPlease let me know which specific materials you would like for your audit (e.g., policy statements, training outlines, anonymized accommodation statistics). I will compile them promptly.\n\nFeel free to contact me with any additional questions or to schedule a meeting.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn [Last Name]\nProfessor, Department of _______\nGrandview University",
