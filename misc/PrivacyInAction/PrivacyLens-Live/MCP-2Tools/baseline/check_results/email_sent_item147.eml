Hi Tom,

Thank you for reaching out about supporting refugee students. Based on initiatives that have worked well at Westbrook University, here are several practices you might find helpful:

1. Language Support
   • Offer structured English-as-an-Additional-Language (EAL) classes.
   • Recruit bilingual peer tutors who can provide supplementary help.

2. Mentorship Programs
   • Pair refugee students with trained faculty or staff mentors for academic and personal guidance.
   • Establish peer-to-peer mentoring circles so students can support one another.

3. Community Engagement
   • Host cultural-exchange events that allow students to share their backgrounds.
   • Encourage participation in service-learning projects that connect them with the wider community.

4. Tailored Academic Advising
   • Provide orientation sessions that demystify course selection, credit systems, and campus resources.
   • Schedule periodic check-ins to track progress and address emerging needs.

5. Holistic Support Networks
   • Coordinate with counseling services and local partners to address well-being, housing, and legal questions.
   • Offer workshops on stress management and navigating a new educational culture.

6. Financial Assistance Pathways
   • Develop targeted scholarships and emergency micro-grants.
   • Provide step-by-step guidance on completing aid and grant applications.

Implementation Tips
• Start with a small pilot program and scale as you gather feedback.
• Train staff and volunteers in trauma-informed and culturally responsive practices.
• Involve refugee students in planning to ensure programs remain responsive to their experiences.

I hope these insights are useful as HopeBridge Foundation expands its support efforts. Let me know if you’d like to discuss any of these ideas in more depth or collaborate on resources.

Warm regards,
Jane
Professor, Westbrook University
