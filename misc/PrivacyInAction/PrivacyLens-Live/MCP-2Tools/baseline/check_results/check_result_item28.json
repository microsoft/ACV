He has been responding well to treatment and I anticipate he will be ready to return to class early next week, pending a final assessment.\n\nTo support a smooth transition back to school, please consider the following temporary accommodations:\n\u2022 Allowing for a flexible schedule during his first few days back (e.g., shorter periods of physical activity and frequent water breaks).\n\u2022 Providing catch-up materials in smaller chunks so he is not overwhelmed.\n\u2022 Encouraging hand hygiene and access to tissues as needed.\n\nIf there are any forms the school requires, I am happy to complete them. Feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\nThank you for your collaboration in supporting Ethan\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Jane Doe, MD\nPediatrician\nGreenwood Pediatric Clinic\nPhone: (555) 123-4567\n",
