Dear Bright Futures Scholarship Foundation Committee,

Thank you for your follow-up request regarding Michael Smith’s scholarship application. I am pleased to provide further context on his accomplishments:

Academic excellence:

• He earned first place at a recent regional science fair through an independent research project focusing on renewable energy.

Leadership & service:
• As current Student Council President, Michael coordinated the school’s annual charity drive, which raised substantial funds for local shelters.
• He is an active contributor to the Science Club and mentors younger students interested in STEM fields.

Character:
• Ms. Thompson, Michael’s history teacher, previously supplied a recommendation emphasizing his integrity, initiative, and collaborative spirit. I fully endorse her assessment.

Please let me know if any further documentation or clarification would be helpful. I remain available to support Michael’s candidacy in any way.
