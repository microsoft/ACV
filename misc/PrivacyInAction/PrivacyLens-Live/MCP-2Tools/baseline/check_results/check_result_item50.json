An evening mid-week might be the safest bet, but I\u2019m flexible\u2014let me know what fits best with everyone\u2019s schedules.\n\n\u2022 Venue ideas: We could reserve a private room at a downtown restaurant so we have space and privacy. If you have another location in mind, let me know and I can make inquiries and handle the booking.\n\n\u2022 Guest list: I\u2019m thinking around 15\u201320 people, including a few of Alex\u2019s friends from outside work. I can manage the invitations once the date\u2019s confirmed.\n\n\u2022 Gift: How about pooling funds for a rugged smartwatch that\u2019s designed for first responders? It feels useful and meaningful. I\u2019m happy to coordinate the group gift if the team is interested.\n\nLet me know what you think or if there\u2019s anything else you need.\n\nExcited to make this happen!\n\nBest,\nJane",
