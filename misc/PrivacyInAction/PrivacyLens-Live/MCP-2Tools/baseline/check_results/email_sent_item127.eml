Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you are doing well. I am currently managing a complex matter at Carter & Associates and would greatly value your seasoned perspective. When you have a moment, could we arrange a brief call or correspond via email so I can outline the main issues and hear your thoughts?

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance.

Best regards,
Jane
Associate, Carter & Associates
