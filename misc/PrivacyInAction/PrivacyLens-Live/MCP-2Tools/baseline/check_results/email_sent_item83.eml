Dear TechSolutions Team,

Thank you for partnering with Hamilton University as we work toward an upgraded student management system. Below is a concise overview of our current hiring process for graduate and undergraduate assistantship positions, along with a few thoughts on how the software might best support each stage.

1. Application Collection
   • The job posting stays open until the published deadline (typically 1 March).
   • Applicants submit a résumé, cover letter, and unofficial transcript via an online form.
   • A confirmation email is automatically sent upon successful submission.

2. Initial HR Screening (by ~15 March)
   • HR staff verify eligibility (enrollment status, GPA threshold, work-study eligibility).
   • Non-qualifying applications are flagged and archived so they are hidden from faculty reviewers.
   • A summary spreadsheet is generated for internal records.

3. Interview Phase (20 March – 5 April)
   • Qualified applicants are forwarded to the Academic Selection Panel.
   • Panel members use a rubric to score candidates and indicate availability for interviews.
   • Interviews are scheduled in 30-minute blocks; applicants receive calendar invites automatically.

4. Committee Deliberation & Decision (by 10 April)
   • Panel scores are aggregated; the hiring committee meets to finalize selections.
   • Conditional offers are recorded in the system pending budget approval.

5. Offer Communication & Onboarding
   • Offer letters are emailed by 15 April.
   • Accepted students are moved to an onboarding queue that triggers tasks (I-9 completion, contract signature, system access).
   • Onboarding officially starts 1 May.

Suggested System Features
• Role-based dashboards: separate views for HR staff, faculty reviewers, and student applicants.
• Automated eligibility checks and flagging.
• Integrated interview scheduling tied to university calendar accounts.
• Centralized scoring rubric with real-time aggregation.
• One-click generation of standardized offer letters and contract packets.
• Task-driven onboarding checklist that tracks completion status for each hire.

Please let me know if any of these points need clarification or if additional detail would be helpful. I’m happy to set up a call to walk through specific workflow diagrams.

Kind regards,

John
Human Resources Management Advisor
