Submit an access request through the HelpDesk portal. In the form, choose \u201cMarketing \u2013 Shared Resources\u201d from the dropdown and reference your current campaign.\n2. Once you submit, you\u2019ll receive an automated ticket number. Reply to that ticket with a brief note confirming your TechSolutions user ID so we can verify your identity.\n3. After verification, IT will grant the appropriate read/write permissions and notify you. Expect the turnaround to be within one business day after we receive your confirmation.\n4. When you log in the first time, the system will prompt you to set up multi-factor authentication. Please complete that step right away; it\u2019s required before any files become visible.\n5. Finally, open the shared drive, navigate to the \u201cMarketing-Campaign-Assets\u201d folder, and you should see everything you need.\n\nProject action reminders (high-level)\n\u2022 Finalize the ad copy in early March.\n\u2022 Secure media placements by the middle of the month.\n\u2022 Schedule social media posts to start later in March.\n\u2022 Begin preparations for the product-launch event slated for early April, coordinating with Sales so messaging stays in sync.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues or need more help.\n\nBest,\nJohn\nIT Administrator",
