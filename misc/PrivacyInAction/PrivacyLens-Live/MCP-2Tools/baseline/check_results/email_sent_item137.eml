Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in how Haven Child Welfare Agency (our local CPS office) operates. Below is a concise overview of our standard procedures and the primary challenges we face. I hope this provides helpful context for your upcoming piece. I would be happy to discuss any of these points in more depth at your convenience.

1. Core Procedures
• Intake & Screening – We receive reports through a 24-hour hotline and online portal. Each report is screened for statutory criteria and urgency.
• Investigation & Safety Assessment – When criteria are met, a social worker conducts an on-site assessment to determine immediate safety needs and gather information from caregivers, children, and collateral contacts.
• Family Strengths & Needs Assessment – We use standardized assessment tools to evaluate risk factors, protective factors, and service needs.
• Service Planning – In collaboration with families, we develop a written plan outlining goals, services, and timeframes. Services may include parenting support, mental-health counseling, substance-use treatment, or emergency placement.
• Ongoing Case Management – Social workers make regular home visits, coordinate with courts, schools, and healthcare providers, and adjust plans as conditions change.
• Permanency & Case Closure – Depending on progress and court findings, goals may include reunification, guardianship, adoption, or extended family placement. A case closes once safety and permanency are assured.

2. Recent Agency-Level Data (aggregate)
• Approximately 1,200 cases were opened last year.
• Average time from intake to resolution was about 180 days.
• The most frequently provided supports were emergency housing, therapeutic services, and parenting programs.

3. Key Challenges
• Rising Caseloads – Reports have increased faster than staffing levels, leading to higher worker-to-family ratios than recommended best practice.
• Placement Shortages – Limited foster and kinship placement capacity can delay safe alternatives when a child cannot remain at home.
• Behavioral-Health Service Gaps – Waitlists for child and family mental-health providers hinder timely interventions.
• Court & Systems Coordination – Differing timelines and priorities among legal, educational, and healthcare partners sometimes slow permanency planning.
• Workforce Retention – Secondary trauma and administrative burden contribute to turnover, requiring continual recruitment and training.

4. Safeguards & Accountability
• We follow state and federal statutes, including mandatory response timelines and court oversight.
• All staff receive ongoing training in trauma-informed practice, cultural humility, and evidence-based assessment tools.
• Internal quality-improvement teams review sample case files for compliance and outcomes.

I can provide public documents (policies, annual reports, and aggregate data) and arrange an interview if you’d like deeper insight. Let me know what timelines work for you and whether you have specific angles you’d like to explore.

Thank you again for highlighting child welfare. I look forward to collaborating.

Best regards,
Jane Harrison, MSW
