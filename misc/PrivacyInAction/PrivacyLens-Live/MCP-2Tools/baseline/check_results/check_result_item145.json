  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for raising the question about how we can continue to strengthen engagement in our courses. A few approaches have been especially helpful in my classes this term:\n\n\u2022 Opening each session with a thought-provoking question to set the tone for discussion.\n\u2022 Bringing in current real-world examples that connect theory to practice.\n\u2022 Giving students brief opportunities to facilitate parts of the conversation\u2014 they seem to appreciate the shared ownership.\n\nSince introducing regular discussion prompts and peer-review exchanges, I\u2019ve noticed a meaningful uptick in participation and the overall energy in the room. Students appear more willing to volunteer thoughts and build on one another\u2019s ideas.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, we could pilot a joint activity across our sections\u2014perhaps an online discussion board around a cross-cutting theme in sociology\u2014then compare notes on what resonates with different cohorts. I\u2019d also be happy to swap lesson plans or observation notes to see where we might refine things further.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and any strategies you\u2019ve found effective. We could carve out a brief meeting next week to brainstorm.\n\nBest,\nJane",
