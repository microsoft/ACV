I\u2019ve pulled together our most recent donor engagement insights to help us align plans for the upcoming joint campaign:\n\n\u2022 Overall trend \u2013 Our donor participation has grown steadily over the past three years, with the most recent quarter showing roughly a 15% uplift in engagement compared with the previous quarter.\n\u2022 Successful tactics \u2013 Personalized outreach (e.g., tailored thank-you messages and donor spotlights) and matching-gift promotions continue to generate the highest response rates.\n\u2022 Seasonal highlight \u2013 The year-end email series last holiday season achieved about a 20% conversion rate and was the single biggest driver of new and repeat gifts in that period.\n\u2022 Preferred channels \u2013 Email remains our top-performing medium, followed by social media appeals that feature concise impact stories.\n\nBased on these findings, doubling down on personalized messaging and a clear matching-gift offer should position the joint campaign for strong results. Let me know if you\u2019d like a deeper breakdown by channel or timeframe, and I can share additional summaries.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating!\n\nBest,\nJohn\nBright Futures Foundation",
