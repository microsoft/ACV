  "email_content": "Dear Emily,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful note! It\u2019s always wonderful to read your reflections from Eldoria.\n\nWork has been busy but rewarding. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen encouraging outcomes\u2014most people who complete our core program remain sober long-term. That momentum keeps our whole team energized.\n\nWe recently ran a workshop on practical coping strategies for relapse prevention. Feedback has been very positive; participants say they feel better equipped to handle day-to-day triggers.\n\nIt\u2019s especially inspiring to watch graduates turn their progress into support for others. Several have returned to steady employment and now volunteer to welcome newcomers.\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019ve started a small herb garden on my balcony\u2014fresh basil everywhere! How are things on your end? Any new cultural festivals coming up in Eldoria?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nWarm hugs across the miles,\nJane",
