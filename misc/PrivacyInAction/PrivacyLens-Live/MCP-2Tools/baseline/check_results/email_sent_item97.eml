Hi Emily,

I hope this message finds you well! It’s been a lively few weeks at the firm and I thought I’d share a quick update.

Work highlights
• I’ve been helping with a big technology-focused lawsuit. It’s pushing me to deepen my knowledge of emerging fields like blockchain and distributed systems—fascinating but also quite complex!
• My days are currently filled with drafting briefs, preparing for depositions, and negotiating potential settlements. Juggling the moving pieces has been a real test of organization and endurance.
• The most rewarding part so far is collaborating with expert witnesses and seeing how technical research translates into legal arguments. At the same time, it can be challenging to explain nuanced concepts to a judge who doesn’t have an engineering background.

Personal challenges & lessons
• Time management remains my nemesis. I’m experimenting with new routines to carve out language-study moments so I don’t lose my French practice (tu vois, je n’ai pas oublié complètement !).
• I’m also learning to advocate for breathing room—saying “no” when my calendar is truly full instead of running on espresso alone.

How about you?
How is life in France? Have you discovered any new authors or cafés worth recommending? I miss our discussions about French idioms and regional slang—feel free to sprinkle some into your reply so I can stretch my vocabulary.

À bientôt et prends soin de toi,

John
