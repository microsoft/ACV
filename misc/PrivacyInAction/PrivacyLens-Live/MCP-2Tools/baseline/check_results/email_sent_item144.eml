Hello,

Here is a brief update on the active accounting projects:

• Account Reconciliation: The reconciliation for the previous quarter is complete. Minor discrepancies identified in the preliminary pass have been resolved, and the final report is on track to be ready for review by the end of this week.

• Quarterly Budget Review: The review has been finalized. Overall expenditure was reduced by roughly 5%, resulting in a surplus that can potentially be allocated to upcoming R&D initiatives. All departmental submissions were received on schedule, and the consolidation process went smoothly.

Next steps:
• Compile the final reconciliation report and circulate it for sign-off.
• Prepare summary slides on budget findings for the leadership meeting next week.
• Begin scenario planning for potential reinvestment options based on the surplus.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed.

Thank you,
John
