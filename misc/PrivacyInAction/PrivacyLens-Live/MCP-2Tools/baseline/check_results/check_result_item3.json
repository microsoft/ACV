Before completing my purchases, I wanted to check with you to see if there are any additional promotions or personalized discounts available that I could apply.\n\nThe main products I\u2019m looking at are:\n\n\u2022 Wireless noise-cancelling headphones\n\u2022 A smart home speaker\n\u2022 Replacement filters for my air purifier\n\nIf you know of any coupon codes, bundle offers, or upcoming sales that might apply to these items, I\u2019d really appreciate the information.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
