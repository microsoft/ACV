Hi Emily,

Thanks for reaching out about best practices for working with clients who present with anxiety disorders. Below is a concise framework you can adapt in session, along with some resources you might find helpful.

1. Comprehensive Assessment
   • Confirm the specific anxiety presentation (e.g., generalized, social, panic) using structured interviews or validated scales.
   • Screen for comorbid mood or substance-related concerns to guide treatment planning.

2. Psychoeducation & Goal-Setting
   • Normalize the physiology of anxiety and the role of avoidance in symptom maintenance.
   • Collaboratively set measurable, graded goals so clients can see progress over time.

3. Core CBT Interventions
   • Cognitive Restructuring – Teach clients to identify automatic thoughts and evaluate them with evidence-based questions ("What is the probability X actually happens?" etc.).
   • Exposure Hierarchies – Create a fear ladder from least to most anxiety-provoking situations and engage in repeated, prolonged exposure until distress reduces.
   • Skills Training – Incorporate breathing retraining, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness as coping tools, but use these strategically so they don’t become safety behaviors.

4. Homework & Between-Session Practice
   • Encourage daily thought records and brief exposure tasks. Consistency outside the therapy room predicts stronger outcomes.

5. Progress Monitoring
   • Re-administer brief symptom scales every few sessions to track change and adjust the plan when needed.

6. When to Consider Adjunctive Support
   • If symptoms remain severe after a solid CBT trial, discuss a medication consult or group therapy for additional exposure opportunities.

Key Resources
   • “Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques for Anxiety” – I uploaded a summary in my Notion that breaks down each of the interventions above with sample worksheets.
   • Guideline Chapters 4–6 from “Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry (MAW)” protocol.
   • For social anxiety, the Clark & Wells model handouts are especially practical.

Feel free to let me know how these fit with the presentations you’re seeing, or if you’d like to role-play a particular intervention before your next session.

Talk soon,
John
