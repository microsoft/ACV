Hi Alex,

Thanks for reaching out. Below is an overview that should help you jump-start the creative work for our upcoming product launch:

1. Company overview
InnoTech is a software company focused on building innovative, user-centric tools that simplify complex processes for businesses of all sizes. Our core values are customer-centricity, innovation, and teamwork.

2. Product snapshot
The new platform is designed to streamline day-to-day workflows through a clean interface and intelligent insights. Key benefits include:
• Quick setup with minimal training
• Real-time analytics dashboards
• Integrations with popular productivity suites

3. Target audience
• Primary: small-to-midsize companies that rely on cloud-based productivity tools.
• Secondary: IT managers and team leads who value intuitive software that delivers measurable results.

4. Brand personality & tone
Our voice is modern, friendly, and solution-oriented. Visually, we favor a clean, minimal aesthetic with generous white space. We typically use:
• Primary color: InnoTech Blue (#1F4E79)
• Secondary color: Light Gray (#F2F4F6)
• Accent color: Electric Green (#22C55E)
• Preferred fonts: Montserrat (headlines) and Open Sans (body copy)

5. Imagery & iconography guidelines
• Use flat or very light 3-D illustrations
• People imagery should feel diverse and collaborative
• Icons should be simple line icons with rounded corners

6. Existing assets
Logo files (SVG & PNG), the font package, and sample screenshots are stored in our shared Drive folder. Let me know if you need new export sizes.

7. Project timeline & deliverables
If possible, it would be great to review your first concept sketches in about two weeks, followed by refined comps and final production files roughly a month later. We can adjust as needed once you have a better sense of scope.

Please let me know if any area needs more detail or if you’d like to schedule a quick call to walk through questions.

Best regards,
Jane
Administrative Assistant | InnoTech
