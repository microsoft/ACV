Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief overview of the patients who could benefit from Helping Hands support over the next few weeks:

1. Mrs. Linda S. – Needs reliable transportation to and from her twice-weekly physical therapy sessions.
2. Mr. George B. – Would appreciate regular companionship visits to help ease social isolation.
3. Mr. Thompson – Will have a series of frequent clinical appointments soon and could use both transportation assistance and help with meal delivery.

Please let me know if you have capacity to assist, and what next steps you’d suggest. I can coordinate introductions or provide any additional information you need once we know availability.

Thanks so much for your ongoing partnership.

Best,
John
