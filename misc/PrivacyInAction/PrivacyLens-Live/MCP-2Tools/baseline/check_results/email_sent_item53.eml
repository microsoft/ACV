Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you! Thanks for asking about my work.

My typical day at Sterling & Locke follows a pretty predictable rhythm. In the morning I catch up on my clients’ portfolios and any overnight market news. Mid-morning the accounting team gets together for a quick huddle to discuss trends we’re seeing and any upcoming deadlines. After lunch I dive into preparing financial statements and polishing reports. Later in the afternoon I usually meet with a couple of clients or their advisors to answer questions and plan next steps. Before heading out, I jot down priorities for the next day so I can start fresh.

What I enjoy most is the variety—some moments are wonderfully analytical while others are all about conversation and problem-solving. It keeps me on my toes and makes the hours fly by. Plus, everyone on the team genuinely collaborates, which makes even the busiest days feel rewarding.

How are things in Brooksville? Any new cultural events or local stories you’ve come across lately? I always love hearing about what’s happening in your corner of the world.

Looking forward to your reply!

Warmly,
Jane
