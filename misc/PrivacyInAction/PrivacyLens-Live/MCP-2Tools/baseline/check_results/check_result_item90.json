We expect to have this ready within the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u2022 Creating a draft schedule for the volunteer training sessions, which will focus on active listening skills and referral protocols.\n\nCould you let me know if Helping Hands has any preferred training materials or documentation we should integrate? Additionally, please share any logistical details (room availability, virtual platform preferences, etc.) on your end so we can align our timelines.\n\nLooking forward to making meaningful progress together. Thank you for your partnership.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane",
