I really enjoyed our discussion around AI advancements, quantum computing, and blockchain applications.\n\nI\u2019ve gathered a few articles and whitepapers that dive deeper into these areas. Let me know if you\u2019d be interested in reviewing any of them, and I can send over links.\n\nWould you be available for a brief virtual coffee sometime next week to continue the conversation and explore potential collaboration opportunities?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
