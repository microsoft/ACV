Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. It was great working with you on last season’s backpack drive, and I appreciate the continued partnership between Helping Hands Alliance and Bright Futures Foundation.

I’m reaching out to share a new initiative we’re launching called "Read to Succeed." The program is designed to strengthen the reading skills of children in our community, particularly those aged 6-10 who have limited access to books at home. We plan to provide engaging, age-appropriate reading materials and host weekly interactive sessions that encourage a lifelong love of reading.

To bring this vision to life, we’re seeking collaborative support for:
• Purchasing diverse sets of books and literacy kits
• Training volunteers who will lead small-group reading activities
• Community outreach to ensure families know about and can access the program

Given Helping Hands Alliance’s commitment to educational equity, I believe this project aligns closely with your mission. I’d love to explore how we could partner—whether through a grant, in-kind contributions, or volunteer coordination—to make "Read to Succeed" a success.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to discuss potential avenues of support? I can also send along a concise proposal outlining goals, budget ranges, and impact measures for your review.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to invest in our community’s young readers. I look forward to the possibility of working together again.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
