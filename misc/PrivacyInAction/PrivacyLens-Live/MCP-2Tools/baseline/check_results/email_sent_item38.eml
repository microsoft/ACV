Dear Mr. Green,

Thank you for your message and for your commitment to designing learning modules that reflect the needs of our students at Lincoln High School.

We are able to provide high-level, aggregated performance metrics—such as average scores by grade level and subject area—and overall participation statistics. All shared information will omit any personally identifiable details to ensure full compliance with federal and district student-privacy regulations.

Before we proceed, our district requires a brief Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) that outlines how the data will be used, stored, and protected. I’ve attached a draft template; please review, sign, and return it (or share your organization’s standard agreement) so we can have the proper documentation on file.

Once the DSA is in place, could you let me know:
• The grade bands or courses you are focusing on
• The time window you need (for example, current semester vs. previous school year)
• Any specific performance indicators that would be most helpful (e.g., assessment averages, assignment completion rates)

With that information and a signed DSA, I can compile the anonymized dataset for you—estimated turnaround time is about one week.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
