Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out. In line with our data-sharing agreement and Union Trust Bank’s confidentiality policies, I’m pleased to provide the latest aggregated customer insights to support your engagement analysis.

Key highlights (April 2025 snapshot):
• Customers aged roughly 25–40 represent about 38 % of our active base, with an estimated median monthly spend of approximately $2.8 k.
• Mobile-banking adoption is strongest among customers under 30; about 72 % of that segment complete at least half of their transactions in the app.
• Mortgage and auto loans together account for roughly 45 % of total loan balances.
• Debit-card usage rose around 18 % year-over-year, likely driven by increased contactless payments.

These figures are fully anonymised and consolidated at portfolio level, ensuring that no individual customer or account can be identified. If you require additional aggregate metrics—such as spend distribution by merchant category or product-level engagement trends—please let me know and I’ll work with our analytics team to prepare them.

For privacy reasons we are unable to share raw transaction-level data or individual account balances. However, we can create further summaries or statistical breakdowns tailored to your modelling needs.

Let me know if this dataset meets your requirements or if we should arrange a brief call to discuss next steps.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
Customer Service Representative
