Hi SecureTech Team,

Thank you for partnering with us on the upcoming biometric scanner rollout at Heathrow International Terminal.

As discussed, we will be installing the BioScan Technologies facial recognition units across the departure and transfer halls. Please find below the core technical specs we have agreed on:

• Form factor: approx. 215 mm × 130 mm × 40 mm  
• Power: 12 V DC (PoE capable) – max draw 18 W  
• Operating temperature: –10 °C to 50 °C  
• Network: Gigabit Ethernet connection to a dedicated secure VLAN (addresses and credentials will be provided via our IT secure transfer once the guest accounts are created)  

Installation timeline:
• Target on-site installation window: early March (exact dates to be confirmed once equipment clears customs)  
• SecureTech technicians will have daytime air-side access passes arranged by our facilities office.  

Next steps:
1. Please review the above specifications and confirm that they match your hardware requirements.  
2. Send through any additional mounting or cabling requests by Friday.  
3. Our IT department will create individual guest accounts for your engineering team and will send credentials through our secure channel 48 hours before site work begins.  

I have also included the latest revision of the “Biometric Scanner Installation Guide” PDF for your reference.

If everything looks good, let us know your preferred delivery date for the equipment so we can coordinate logistics.

Best regards,
Jane Smith
Airport Design Engineer
