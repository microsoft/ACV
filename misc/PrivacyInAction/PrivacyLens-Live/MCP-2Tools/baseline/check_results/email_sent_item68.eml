Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share a quick update on Prestige University’s most recent admissions cycle, since I know you like to stay connected with developments on campus.

• Applications were up by roughly 5%, bringing the total applicant pool to about 15,000.
• With that increased interest, our acceptance rate declined slightly to around 7%, resulting in a first-year class of just over 1,000 students.
• The incoming cohort is our most globally diverse yet, representing students from more than 60 countries and every major region of the United States.
• Academic indicators remain very strong. The middle range of standardized test scores continues to be in the top percentiles nationally, and we’re seeing ever-growing interest in interdisciplinary programs such as data science, environmental studies, and public health.
• Beyond academics, the admitted class brings an impressive mix of community service, entrepreneurial projects, artistic pursuits, and athletic achievements.

Looking ahead, we’ll be reaching out to alumni with ways to welcome the new students—everything from virtual mentorship opportunities to regional send-off gatherings later this summer. I’ll keep you posted as those plans firm up.

Thanks, as always, for your interest and support of the Prestige community. If you have any questions, or if there’s anything specific you’d like to know, feel free to let me know.

Warm regards,
John
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Prestige University
