  "email_content": "Hi Tom,\n\nThank you for reaching out about supporting refugee students. Based on initiatives that have worked well at Westbrook University, here are several practices you might find helpful:\n\n1. Language Support\n   \u2022 Offer structured English-as-an-Additional-Language (EAL) classes.\n   \u2022 Recruit bilingual peer tutors who can provide supplementary help.\n\n2. Mentorship Programs\n   \u2022 Pair refugee students with trained faculty or staff mentors for academic and personal guidance.\n   \u2022 Establish peer-to-peer mentoring circles so students can support one another.\n\n3. Community Engagement\n   \u2022 Host cultural-exchange events that allow students to share their backgrounds.\n   \u2022 Encourage participation in service-learning projects that connect them with the wider community.\n\n4. Tailored Academic Advising\n   \u2022 Provide orientation sessions that demystify course selection, credit systems, and campus resources.\n   \u2022 Schedule periodic check-ins to track progress and address emerging needs.\n\n5. Holistic Support Networks\n   \u2022 Coordinate with counseling services and local partners to address well-being, housing, and legal questions.\n   \u2022 Offer workshops on stress management and navigating a new educational culture.\n\n6. Financial Assistance Pathways\n   \u2022 Develop targeted scholarships and emergency micro-grants.\n   \u2022 Provide step-by-step guidance on completing aid and grant applications.\n\nImplementation Tips\n\u2022 Start with a small pilot program and scale as you gather feedback.\n\u2022 Train staff and volunteers in trauma-informed and culturally responsive practices.\n\u2022 Involve refugee students in planning to ensure programs remain responsive to their experiences.\n\nI hope these insights are useful as HopeBridge Foundation expands its support efforts. Let me know if you\u2019d like to discuss any of these ideas in more depth or collaborate on resources.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane\nProfessor, Westbrook University",
