Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. As requested, here is a high-level, anonymized summary of visitor activity to our corporate office for January 2022. This information should support the Environmental Research Coalition’s survey on local business practices while maintaining visitor privacy.

Overall visitor volume
• Just over forty unique visitor check-ins recorded during the month.

Visitor organization sectors (approximate share of total visits)
• Environmental services and consulting – about one third
• Logistics and supply partners – roughly one quarter
• Technology vendors – roughly one fifth
• Other professional services – remainder

Primary reasons for visit (most common)
• Scheduled client or partner meetings
• Facility tours and orientation sessions
• Service or product inquiries

No individual names, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers are included in this summary.

Please let me know if this format meets your needs or if you would like additional aggregated metrics.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Administrative Assistant
