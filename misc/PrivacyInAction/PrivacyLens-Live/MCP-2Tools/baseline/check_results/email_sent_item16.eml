Hi Mark and Sarah,

As requested, please find below a consolidated snapshot of the latest performance trends and the preliminary budget outlook for your departments. All metrics are aggregated at the team level so that individual employee information remains confidential.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Key Performance Highlights (Most Recent Completed Quarter)
--------------------------------------------------
Software Development
• Output: Delivered 112% of planned sprint story points, keeping average cycle time stable.
• Quality: Post-release defect rate fell by roughly 6% following code-quality initiatives.
• Engagement: Team-wide satisfaction survey shows a 9-point improvement compared with the previous quarter.

Digital Marketing
• Campaign Effectiveness: Overall campaign ROI has grown by low-double-digit percentages, driven by improved targeting and A/B testing.
• Lead Generation: Inbound qualified leads increased by about 15% quarter-over-quarter.
• Engagement: Content interaction metrics (opens, clicks) rose steadily, indicating stronger audience resonance.

--------------------------------------------------
2. FY2026 Preliminary Budget Outlook
--------------------------------------------------
Software Development – Total forecast: approx. $2.5 M
   • Planned new hires: ~$0.50 M
   • Salary progression & retention programs: ~$0.35 M
   • Ongoing operational costs (tools, infrastructure, training, etc.): ~$1.65 M

Digital Marketing – Total forecast: approx. $1.2 M
   • Campaign execution & media spend: ~$0.75 M
   • Martech & analytics platforms: ~$0.25 M
   • Professional development & events: ~$0.20 M

These numbers align with the company-wide budget framework shared earlier this month and are subject to final Finance sign-off.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Next Steps
--------------------------------------------------
• Please review the figures and let me know if you need any further breakdowns (e.g., specific project allocations, timeline phasing, etc.).
• I will incorporate any feedback before the consolidated plan is submitted to the Finance team for final approval.

Thanks both for your collaboration.

Best regards,
Jane
