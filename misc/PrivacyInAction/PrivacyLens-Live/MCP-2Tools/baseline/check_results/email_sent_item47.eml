Hello Justice for All Legal Aid Team,

Congratulations on launching your initiative! I work closely with community members who often need support navigating immigration matters and other legal concerns. I wanted to introduce a few items that may be helpful as you expand your pro-bono services:

• Carlos – a community member who is currently reviewing his options for a family-based immigration case. He would benefit from an initial consultation with your team.

• Resource list – I have compiled a living Notion document that aggregates local legal clinics, pro-bono attorneys, and community organizations. I can share view access so your team can integrate or reference any of the contacts.

Please let me know the best next steps for scheduling a quick intake call with Carlos and discuss how we might streamline future referrals. I’m excited to collaborate!

Thank you for the important work you’re doing.

Warm regards,
Jane
Community Advocate
