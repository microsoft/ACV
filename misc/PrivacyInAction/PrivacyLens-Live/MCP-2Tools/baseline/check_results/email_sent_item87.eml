Dear Alumni,

I am excited to share a brief update on the prospective class applying to the University of Excellence for the upcoming academic year.

• We have received roughly 5,000 applications so far.
• The average SAT score among applicants is about 1420, and the average ACT score is around 32.
• Applicants represent more than 100 countries, reflecting the global reach of our community.
• Essay themes point to remarkable resilience, creativity, and a strong desire to make a positive impact—qualities that align perfectly with the spirit of Excellence.

Over the coming months we’ll be reviewing applications and selecting a class that continues our tradition of academic distinction and service-oriented leadership. Your ongoing support—whether through mentorship, internship opportunities, or sharing your own stories—plays a pivotal role in attracting and nurturing top talent.

Thank you for being an essential part of the University of Excellence family. We look forward to keeping you updated on the admissions journey and welcoming the next generation of scholars.

Warm regards,

John Doe
Alumni Relations Coordinator
