Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to share a brief update regarding Emma Thompson’s ongoing involvement with Helping Hands Foundation this semester.

• Commitment and reliability: Emma has consistently arrived early, stayed late, and readily accepted additional tasks as needed. She has already completed more volunteer hours than what is typically expected at this point in the term.

• Initiative and leadership: Foundation team members have praised her ability to motivate other volunteers and her proactive approach in identifying areas where she can assist.

• Positive impact: Her friendly and respectful manner with community members and staff alike continues to create a welcoming atmosphere at events.

• Academic standing: Despite her extensive service commitments, Emma continues to perform at a high academic level, demonstrating strong time-management and prioritization skills.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are new projects where Emma’s skills might be especially useful.

Thank you for providing such a meaningful opportunity for our students. I appreciate the guidance and support you and your team extend.

Best regards,
John
Professor, [University]
