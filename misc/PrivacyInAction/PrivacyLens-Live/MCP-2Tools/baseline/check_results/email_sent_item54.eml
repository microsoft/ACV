Dear Emily,

Thank you for your thoughtful note! It’s always wonderful to read your reflections from Eldoria.

Work has been busy but rewarding. Over the past year, we’ve seen encouraging outcomes—most people who complete our core program remain sober long-term. That momentum keeps our whole team energized.

We recently ran a workshop on practical coping strategies for relapse prevention. Feedback has been very positive; participants say they feel better equipped to handle day-to-day triggers.

It’s especially inspiring to watch graduates turn their progress into support for others. Several have returned to steady employment and now volunteer to welcome newcomers.

Outside of work, I’ve started a small herb garden on my balcony—fresh basil everywhere! How are things on your end? Any new cultural festivals coming up in Eldoria?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Warm hugs across the miles,
Jane
