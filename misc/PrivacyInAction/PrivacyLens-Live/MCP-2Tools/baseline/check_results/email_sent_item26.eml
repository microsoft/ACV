Hi Ms. Richardson,

I wanted to share a brief progress update on the Zenith Wellness Initiative.

Program Highlights
• Participation has climbed to roughly 78% of employees since the program launch in January.
• Resources being used most frequently include the gym membership benefit, our nutritional planning sessions, and the recurring stress-management workshops.
• Participant feedback has been very positive so far, especially regarding the convenience of the onsite classes and the clarity of the nutritional plans.

Early Outcomes
• We’re already seeing encouraging improvements in general fitness and cardiovascular indicators across participants who have completed two or more assessments.
• Several employees report weight reduction and better-managed blood pressure, and many have noted increased energy levels during the workday.

Next Steps (June–August)
• Launch a short mid-year satisfaction survey to gather more structured feedback.
• Expand available class times to accommodate different shift schedules.
• Pilot a mindfulness series in July in partnership with an external facilitator.
• Prepare a concise mid-year impact report for senior leadership.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional detail or have suggestions for priorities to highlight in the upcoming report.

Best regards,
John
Health Program Coordinator
