Hi Mark,

Thank you for checking in. Eric has let us know that his recent absences are related to a personal matter, and HR has received the required paperwork. We are staying in close contact with him and will keep you updated on any changes that affect scheduling or workload.

In the meantime, please continue to support him and let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Best regards,
Jane
Human Resources Manager
