Hello GeoAnalytica Team,

Thank you for your recent note requesting the foundation and geological information for the Grandview Bridge project.

Attached you will find the latest geological survey data set, including:
• Borehole logs and in-situ test results taken at the planned pier locations
• Stratigraphic profiles and groundwater observations
• Preliminary bearing-capacity estimates for depths around 30, 50, and 70 feet

Key project context:
• The bridge will require a deep foundation system; final pile or drilled-shaft selection will depend on your detailed recommendations.
• Our target is to finalize the foundation design during early March, so receiving your full soil analysis report by the first week of March will help us keep the schedule on track.

Please review the data and let us know if any additional information or clarifications are needed. If possible, notify us by the end of February so we can provide further material without delaying your work.

We appreciate your support and look forward to your insights.

Best regards,
John Doe
