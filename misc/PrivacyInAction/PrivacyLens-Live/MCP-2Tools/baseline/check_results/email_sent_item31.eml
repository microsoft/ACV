Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a summary of several recent customer-behavior trends at First Trust Bank that should help shape the campaign. All figures are aggregated across our retail portfolio for the last twelve months.

1. Digital-first momentum
   • Roughly two-thirds of all new personal accounts are opened through our mobile or web platforms.
   • The strongest uptake is among customers aged 25–34, who are 1.4× more likely than the overall average to choose a fully digital onboarding path.

2. Mobile app engagement drivers 
   • Push notifications that reference real-time balance updates or upcoming payment dates lift in-app session frequency by about 20 %. 
   • Customers who enable card-control features (lock/unlock, spending limits) show a 15 % lower attrition rate after six months.

3. Branch value proposition
   • While digital usage is high, customers aged 55 + still cite in-person guidance as a top reason for staying with the bank. Education-focused clinics on retirement planning consistently attract strong attendance.

4. Small-business segment
   • The most requested products are flexible credit lines and instant-settlement merchant services. Featuring fast funding in ad copy has improved click-through rates for this group in recent pilots.

5. Community and trust cues
   • Messaging that highlights local sponsorships or financial-education workshops scores 18 % higher on brand-trust perception surveys across all age groups.

Campaign considerations
• Lead with the convenience and security of the mobile app for younger audiences (25–44). Emphasize card-control features and real-time alerts.
• For 55 + customers, pair any digital call-to-action with an invitation to speak to a banker or attend an in-branch clinic.
• Spotlight rapid funding and tailored support in creative aimed at small-business owners.
• Thread community-impact stories throughout all placements to reinforce trust.

I’m happy to dig deeper into any of these areas or provide additional data cuts—just let me know what would be most useful.

Looking forward to seeing the creative concepts.

Best regards,
John
First Trust Bank
