Hi Mark,

Quick update on our project:

• Encryption library: I've resolved the data encryption bug we discussed. All unit tests are green and initial integration tests with the data pipeline look solid.

• Client-side integration: Let me know how things are going on your end. Once you have the front-end wired up to the new endpoints, I can help test end-to-end.

• Next steps:
  – Performance benchmarking to ensure we meet SLA targets.
  – Documentation and storyboard for the upcoming demo.
  – Code review; I'd like to schedule a walkthrough late this week if that works for you.

Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks!

Best,
Jane
