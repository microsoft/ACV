  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re well. I\u2019m reaching out to discuss a project I\u2019m developing \u2013 a community sports program designed to engage local youth through inclusive, multi-sport activities. The initiative focuses on teamwork, discipline, and encouraging an active lifestyle.\n\nGiven the Active Youth Foundation\u2019s mission, I believe there\u2019s strong alignment and potential for us to collaborate. I\u2019d love to explore how we might work together on areas such as participant outreach, event logistics, volunteer coordination, and securing resources for equipment and facilities.\n\nI have drafted a proposal outlining the program\u2019s objectives, structure, and tentative timeline. I\u2019d be happy to share this document and hear your thoughts. Would you be available for a brief call or meeting next week to discuss possibilities?\n\nThank you for considering this partnership. I\u2019m excited about the impact we could make together.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
