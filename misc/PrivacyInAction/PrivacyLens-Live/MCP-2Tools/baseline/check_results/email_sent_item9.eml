Hi Susan,

As requested, please find below the draft proposal for our upcoming team retreat.

Team Retreat Proposal (Overview)
———————————————————————
Objective:
• Strengthen team cohesion, creativity, and cross-department collaboration in an engaging off-site setting.

Timing:
• Targeting a two-day program in late autumn (exact dates flexible pending team input and venue availability).

Venue Criteria:
• Accessible within reasonable travel distance for our full team.
• On-site meeting space plus outdoor areas for group activities.
• Lodging that offers both single and shared options.
• Kitchen and catering partners able to provide diverse meal choices (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, kosher, etc.).
• Step-free access to main facilities.

Sample Activities:
• Cooperative escape-style challenge focused on problem-solving.
• Scenic group hike with optional shorter trail for different ability levels.
• Creative workshop (e.g., painting or cooking class) to spark fresh thinking.
• Trust-building and communication exercises led by an external facilitator.
• Evening social with light entertainment and open networking time.

Budget Framework:
• Mid-range per-person cost that covers lodging, meals, facilitator fees, basic activity materials, and local transport.
• Detailed cost breakdown and vendor quotes available upon request.

Next Steps:
1. Confirm preferred date window with leadership.
2. Short-list two venues that meet the above criteria.
3. Collect team feedback on activity preferences.
4. Finalize booking and schedule by the end of next month.

I’m happy to iterate on any section or add additional details. Let me know your thoughts and any adjustments you’d like.

Best regards,
John
