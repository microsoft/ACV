Dear Oakwood Alumni Reunion Committee,

I hope you are doing well as you finalize plans for the upcoming reunion. I wanted to pass along a brief roundup of recent accomplishments and news from our alumni community:

Class of 2005:
• John Smith was promoted to Director of Marketing at Innotech Solutions.
• Emily Johnson published her second novel, which has been shortlisted for a national literary award.

Class of 2010:
• Mark Lee launched a technology startup that recently secured major venture-capital backing.
• Lisa Ray’s non-profit organization has expanded its education programs to several additional countries.

Campus & Alumni Events:
• Several alumni will be honored for their philanthropic efforts at the Oakwood Charity Gala in mid-June.
• A reminder that the deadline for this year’s Oakwood Alumni Scholarship applications falls in late April.

Please feel free to share these highlights with your classmates or let me know if there are other updates you would like included in reunion materials. I’m happy to provide supporting photos or short bios upon request.

Thank you for your ongoing work bringing the Oakwood community together. I look forward to supporting a memorable celebration.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
Alumni Relations Coordinator
