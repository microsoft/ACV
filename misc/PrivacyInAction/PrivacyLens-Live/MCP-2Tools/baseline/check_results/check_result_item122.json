We believe that by combining our resources and expertise, we can better support families impacted by natural disasters and strengthen community resilience.\n\nOur team has put together a brief proposal outlining objectives, potential outcomes, and a framework for collaboration.

Please let me know a time that works best for you, and I\u2019ll be happy to coordinate.\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity.
