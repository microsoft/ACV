Dear Deputy Secretary Caldwell,

I appreciate the opportunity to share front-line observations that may inform the Department’s policy discussions. Drawing on recent work in Metro City, I would highlight several priority areas:

1. Rise in Technology-Enabled Crime
• Cyber-enabled theft and fraud incidents are increasing faster than traditional offenses, stretching the investigative capacity of local departments. Bolstering regional digital-forensics labs and offering specialized training for officers could close a critical skills gap.
• Cross-border nature of these crimes underscores the need for streamlined data-sharing agreements between jurisdictions and with private-sector platforms.

2. Evidence Collection in Low-Visibility Spaces
• Many serious incidents occur in locations with limited lighting and camera coverage. Incentivizing improved environmental design—better street illumination and more interoperable public-safety cameras—can make a measurable difference.

3. Community Trust & Information Flow
• Community-oriented policing programs have reduced minor property crimes in several neighborhoods and improved resident cooperation. Supporting grants that expand similar engagement models could multiply these results city-wide.

4. Officer Wellness and Retention
• Growing caseload complexity and overtime commitments contribute to burnout. Policies that fund peer-support resources and modern scheduling tools can improve retention and performance.

5. Recruiting a Technologically Fluent Workforce
• Departments need a pipeline of officers conversant in data analytics, open-source intelligence, and emerging technologies. Scholarship or tuition-for-service programs focused on these competencies may help attract talent.

I would welcome any follow-up questions and remain available to elaborate on these points or connect your team with subject-matter specialists inside MCPD.

Thank you for your commitment to supporting municipal agencies.

Respectfully,
Det. Jane [Last Name]
