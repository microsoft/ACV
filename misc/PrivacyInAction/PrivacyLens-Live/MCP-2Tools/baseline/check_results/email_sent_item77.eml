Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you are keeping well. I wanted to share a brief update on the Heathrow Terminal 5 expansion project I have been working on and, as always, would really value your perspective.

Where we are now
• Initial concept sketches have been completed, outlining additional boarding areas, an upgraded lounge zone, and improved passenger circulation paths that connect seamlessly to the existing terminal.
• Our team has reviewed the relevant public zoning and environmental regulations to ensure the design remains fully compliant.
• We are now refining the structural framework and façade concept to balance durability, efficiency, and aesthetics, with particular emphasis on natural lighting and energy-efficient materials.

Where I would love your input
1. Structural integrity: We are comparing several long-span roof truss configurations to maximise column-free space in the new concourse. Any guidance on potential pitfalls or optimisation strategies would be greatly appreciated.
2. Façade and cladding: I am exploring high-performance glass and lightweight composite panels to achieve both transparency and thermal performance. From your experience, are there specific material systems or detailing approaches you have found particularly effective?
3. Passenger experience: Do you have suggestions on integrating intuitive wayfinding elements into the structure itself so that movement feels effortless and visually cohesive?

Next steps
Over the coming quarter, we aim to freeze the schematic design and proceed to detailed structural calculations. Your seasoned eye on the above aspects would help us steer the design in the right direction before we lock things in.

If you have time for a quick call or could jot down any thoughts via email, I would be immensely grateful.

Thank you again for being such a steady source of wisdom throughout my career.

Warm regards,
Jane
