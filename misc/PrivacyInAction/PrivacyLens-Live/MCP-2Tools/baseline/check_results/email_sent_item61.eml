Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to give you a quick overview of the most recent developments so you can share them with community members:

1. Upcoming Legal Clinic
• Registration has reached full capacity, so please let participants know that no additional slots are available. Remind everyone who is already registered to bring any relevant documents and to arrive a little early so we can stay on schedule.

2. Educational Workshops
• The workshop series with the Immigrant Aid Society is confirmed for the first week of March. These sessions will focus on helping newcomers understand their rights and the legal process. I’ll send you the finalized flyer shortly so you can circulate it.

3. Individual Case Follow-Up
• Carlos’s matter is progressing. We have a strategy session scheduled soon to outline the next steps. I’ll share more details once we’ve finalized the plan.

Thank you, as always, for passing this information along and supporting the community.

Best,
John
