Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing regarding Emily Carter, a student in your advanced economics course. Shortly before your recent examination, Emily experienced a traumatic incident that temporarily affected her ability to attend class on the day of the test.

Emily is actively taking steps to restore her well-being and continue her studies. In light of these circumstances, I kindly request your consideration in providing her with an opportunity to complete the missed assessment or another suitable means to demonstrate her understanding of the material.

Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you for your understanding and support of Emily’s academic progress.

Sincerely,

Jane Harrison, Psy.D.
University of Greenfield
