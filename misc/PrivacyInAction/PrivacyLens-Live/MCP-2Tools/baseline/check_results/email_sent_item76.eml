Hi Sarah,

Just sharing a brief status update before we sync up later:

• Development: The new algorithm has been fully integrated into the trading platform and is currently in final testing. So far, no major issues have surfaced.

• Milestones: All interim targets have been met on schedule.

• Next steps: I’ll start compiling the user documentation and training materials so we’re ready for the upcoming client workshop. Let me know if you’d like to review any sections.

• Presentation: Reminder that the investment-strategy deck is due next week. I’ll incorporate the latest market-analysis data tonight—could you please give the slides a once-over tomorrow?

Thanks, and let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
John
