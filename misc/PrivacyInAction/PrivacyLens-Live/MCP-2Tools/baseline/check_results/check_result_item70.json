  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nI wanted to share a brief update on how the revised curriculum has been performing this semester.\n\nKey observations so far:\n\u2022 Overall student performance has risen noticeably, with aggregate grades showing a double-digit improvement compared with the previous term.\n\u2022 Students consistently highlight the hands-on, real-world components as particularly helpful for grasping core concepts.\n\u2022 The most common request is for additional guidance and resources in the more advanced modules. A few learners also mentioned that extra review sessions prior to major assessments would be beneficial.\n\nWhat this means:\n\u2013 The practical, project-based elements appear to be a clear strength worth preserving.\n\u2013 We may want to consider adding optional tutoring hours, peer-led study groups, or supplemental materials to support the transition into higher-level content.\n\nNext steps:\n1. I will prepare a concise summary report with aggregated data trends (no individual information) for our joint reference.\n2. Let\u2019s schedule a brief call next week to discuss potential support strategies and any insights you\u2019re seeing on your end.\n\nPlease let me know if you have questions or would like the preliminary summary sooner.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
