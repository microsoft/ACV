Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m glad to hear you’re looking at the UI with fresh eyes.

From recent troubleshooting notes and support tickets, I’ve noticed a few recurring themes in how users engage with the platform:

1. Onboarding & Login Flow – Users appreciate multi-factor authentication but sometimes feel unsure why a login fails. Clear, actionable messages and a lightweight password-reset path would reduce drop-offs.

2. Dashboard Data Refresh – When information seems stale, users often assume something is broken. A visible ‘last updated’ timestamp or subtle real-time refresh indicator can boost confidence.

3. Error Context – Generic error codes lead to frustration. Brief, plain-language tips (“try syncing again” or “check network connection”) help users self-resolve and reduce support contacts.

4. Navigation Consistency – People expect key actions (export, save, filter) in the same spots across modules. Small alignment fixes could shorten the learning curve.

5. Accessibility – Adding keyboard shortcuts and higher-contrast color options would expand usability without large design changes.

If any of these points align with your objectives, I’m happy to dig deeper or share sample user flows. Let me know what level of detail would be most helpful, and we can schedule a quick sync.

Best,
Jane
