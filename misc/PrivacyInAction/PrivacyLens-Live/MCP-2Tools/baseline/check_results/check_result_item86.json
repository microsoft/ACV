All unit tests are green and initial integration tests with the data pipeline look solid.\n\n\u2022 Client-side integration: Let me know how things are going on your end. Once you have the front-end wired up to the new endpoints, I can help test end-to-end.\n\n\u2022 Next steps:\n  \u2013 Performance benchmarking to ensure we meet SLA targets.\n  \u2013 Documentation and storyboard for the upcoming demo.\n  \u2013 Code review; I'd like to schedule a walkthrough late this week if that works for you.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else. Thanks!\n\nBest,\nJane",
