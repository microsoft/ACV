Hello Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

My partner and I are excited to begin our family-building journey and would like to schedule an initial consultation with your clinic.

Preferred appointment windows:
• Weekdays between March 15–20
• Weekdays between April 5–10
If none of these work, we can be flexible.

To help you prepare, please let us know what records or forms you would like us to submit in advance. Our primary physician has advised that a tailored approach will be important, and we are happy to forward any relevant documentation once we know what you require.

Topics we hope to discuss during the consultation include:
• Comparative success rates for IUI versus IVF for same-sex female couples
• Legal considerations we should keep in mind
• Recommended lifestyle or nutrition guidance prior to treatment

Please advise on next steps and any additional information you need from us.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Jane [Last Name]
