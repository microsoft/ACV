  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well.\n\nI wanted to share a short update on the group of athletes supported by Sports Future Foundation.\n\n\u2022 Training & Conditioning: Overall training adherence has been strong, and most athletes are on pace or ahead of their individualized performance benchmarks. Recent strength and speed tests show steady gains across the squad.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship Program: The peer-learning initiative that launched at the start of the year continues to receive enthusiastic participation and is fostering a supportive training environment.\n\n\u2022 Focus Areas: Over the next phase we will place extra emphasis on endurance work and on the preventive exercises prescribed by our physio consultants to minimize over-use issues as training volumes rise.\n\n\u2022 Upcoming Scheduling: A block of simulated competition sessions is planned for early next month, which will give us fresh performance data ahead of the next quarterly review.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like any additional detail or a wider written report. Thank you again for the Foundation\u2019s continued support.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
