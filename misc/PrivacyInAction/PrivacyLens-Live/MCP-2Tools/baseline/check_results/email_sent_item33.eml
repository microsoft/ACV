Hi Mark,

Here’s the latest snapshot of the candidates we’re considering for your team:

• Tom Davis – 10+ years of software development experience at GlobalSoft and InnoTech. Technical interviews went well. Background check is still under review; I’ll keep you posted.

• Susan Lee – M.S. in Computer Science with 5 years at FastTech focusing on AI/ML. Strong coding exercise and culture fit.

• Raj Patel – 10 years in cybersecurity at CyberNet and SecureTech. Great performance in system design interview; references are pending.

Next steps:
– Expect final background-check results for Tom later this week.
– Reference calls for Raj should wrap up by Friday.
– If all goes well, we could schedule final panel interviews early next week.

Let me know if you’d like deeper details or to meet any of them sooner.

Best,
Jane
