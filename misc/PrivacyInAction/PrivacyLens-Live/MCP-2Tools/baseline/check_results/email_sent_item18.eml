Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in how Union Trust Bank handles consumer disputes. Below is a high-level overview of our standard process for card-related transaction disputes. This framework also guides our approach to other consumer complaints, with timelines adjusted as required by applicable regulations.

1. Initiating a Dispute
   • A customer can submit a dispute through online banking, by phone, or in person at any branch.
   • We immediately acknowledge receipt and provide the customer with a reference number for tracking.

2. Documentation
   • Customers are asked to complete a short Disputed Transaction Form and, when relevant, an Affidavit of Unauthorized Use. Supporting receipts or correspondence with the merchant help speed the investigation but are not mandatory to open a case.

3. Provisional Credit & Acknowledgment
   • In most card-related cases, provisional credit is issued within 10 business days if the investigation cannot be resolved sooner. We notify the customer in writing when this occurs.

4. Investigation Phase
   • Our investigations team reviews account activity, contacts the merchant’s acquiring bank through the card network, and gathers any additional evidence.
   • Typical timeframes are 30–45 days for domestic transactions and up to 90 days for complex or cross-border cases, in line with Regulation E and the CARD Act.

5. Updates & Milestones
   • Customers receive written updates at key points: confirmation of dispute, issuance of provisional credit (if applicable), and final decision.

6. Resolution & Final Decision
   • When the investigation concludes, we provide a detailed outcome letter explaining findings and any permanent credit or reversal. If provisional credit was issued and the dispute is denied, the amount is re-debited only after the customer has had at least five business days’ notice.

7. Escalation Options
   • If a customer disagrees with the outcome, they may request a secondary review by our Customer Advocacy Office.
   • External avenues—such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or relevant state banking authorities—remain available at any stage.

Key Safeguards
   • All investigations are managed by a dedicated team independent of our sales and merchant-acquiring functions to ensure impartiality.
   • We track dispute-handling metrics (turnaround time, reversal rates, and customer satisfaction) to identify trends and improve service.

Regarding your request for information on a specific cardholder dispute with the merchant you mentioned, I’m afraid we’re unable to discuss individual cases due to customer-privacy obligations. However, aggregated data show that disputed transactions represent less than 0.15 % of our yearly card volume, and over 90 % are resolved within 45 days.

I hope this overview is helpful to your article. I’m happy to clarify any of the steps above or arrange a brief call if you’d like deeper context on regulatory requirements or industry practices.

Best regards,
Jane
Customer Service Representative
