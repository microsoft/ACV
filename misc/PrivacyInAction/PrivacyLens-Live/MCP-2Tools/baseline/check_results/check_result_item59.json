  "email_content": "Dear Hope and Healing Foundation Team,\n\nI hope you are well. I\u2019m writing to share an update on the impact your past contributions have made at New Horizons Recovery Center and to explore possibilities for renewed collaboration.\n\nThanks in large part to your previous grant, our outreach initiatives have continued to grow. Over the past year we have:\n\u2022 Increased community engagement by roughly 40%.\n\u2022 Achieved a 15% improvement in recovery outcomes among program participants.\n\u2022 Launched the \"Steps to Sobriety\" workshop series and expanded our \"Family Support Network,\" both of which are meeting critical needs in the region.\n\nAs demand keeps rising, we are preparing to:\n\u2022 Add two new workshop cohorts each quarter;\n\u2022 Extend the Family Support Network to neighboring counties; and\n\u2022 Pilot a mobile outreach unit to serve individuals in remote areas.\n\nTo make these expansions possible, we are seeking renewed financial support. A grant of $50,000 would help cover facilitator stipends, educational materials, and operational costs for the first year of these enhancements. We would, of course, welcome any level of support the Foundation can provide.\n\nI would be happy to send a concise impact brief and meet at your convenience to discuss how we can continue working together to change lives.\n\nThank you again for your steadfast commitment to our mission.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJohn [Last Name]\nAlcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator\nNew Horizons Recovery Center\n(555) 123-4567",
