Hi David,

Following our recent discussions and my review of our current corporate tax audit workflow, I’ve outlined several opportunities to further streamline our joint approach:

1. Centralized digital document hub – Agree on a shared, secure repository for all taxpayer-provided records to reduce retrieval time and eliminate version confusion.

2. Risk-based scoping – Use a standardized risk-scoring checklist up-front so that audit resources are concentrated on high-exposure areas and simpler sections move through quickly.

3. Template library – Build a set of pre-approved information request and work-paper templates so teams spend less time drafting and more on analysis.

4. Data analytics & automation – Identify repetitive tests (e.g., reconciliation of general ledger to returns) that can be automated using Excel scripting or Power BI to shorten fieldwork.

5. Early issue resolution protocol – Schedule short “quick-hit” touchpoints with taxpayers during fieldwork to clear open questions before they snowball into re-work.

6. Knowledge capture – After each engagement, conduct a 15-minute debrief to log lessons learned and update templates/process docs.

Next steps
If these items look reasonable, let’s prioritize the first two for a pilot on our upcoming cases. I’m available for a call early next week to flesh out responsibilities and timing.

Thanks again for your partnership, and please let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
Jane
