All figures are fully de-identified and represent population-level summaries only.\n\n\u2022 BRCA1 pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variant: approximately 5 % prevalence in the counseled population (n \u2248 cohort-level figure available on request).\n\nThese data contain no individual-level identifiers or personal health information and are suitable for research use under standard ethical guidelines.\n\nPlease let me know if you need additional markers, demographic breakdowns, or a specific file format. I can provide a spreadsheet or other structured file once I have your preferred column headings.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to supporting the study.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe, MS, CGC\nGenetic Counselor\n",
