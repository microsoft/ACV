Hello Alex,

Thank you for considering me for the Lead Developer position at InnovateX. I remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

After researching current market rates and reflecting on my experience leading projects and mentoring developers, I believe that a base salary in the range of $125,000–$135,000 per year, together with a standard performance-based bonus structure and benefits, would be appropriate.

That said, I value the overall fit and growth potential highly, and I’m open to discussing the details further to arrive at a package that works well for both of us.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
John Doe
