  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. My name is John, and I\u2019ve just joined Zenith Innovations. I\u2019ll be partnering with you on our upcoming project, and I wanted to personally reach out to say hello.\n\nBy way of quick background, I have several years of experience in product development, where I\u2019ve enjoyed solving complex problems and working closely with cross-functional teams. I\u2019m particularly interested in innovative solutions that blend technical rigor with creative thinking.\n\nOutside of work, you can often find me out hiking local trails or behind a camera lens experimenting with photography\u2014both hobbies that keep my curiosity and attention to detail sharp.\n\nI\u2019m excited to learn more about your work and to see how we can combine our strengths to deliver great results. Please let me know if there\u2019s anything I can prepare ahead of our first team meeting.\n\nLooking forward to working together!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
