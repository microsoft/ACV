Hello MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out from Greenleaf Health Center regarding the software update scheduled for mid-April. This period overlaps with one of our busiest weeks for patient appointments, so we’d like to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.

To help us prepare, could you please provide:
1. The confirmed update window and expected system downtime duration.
2. Any options for performing the update during off-peak hours or in stages to minimize service interruption.
3. Details on data backup and migration steps to guarantee the integrity of patient records.
4. Access to a sandbox or demo environment so our staff can familiarize themselves with new features in advance.
5. Training materials or brief virtual sessions that outline key workflow changes in appointment scheduling and record management.
6. Contact information for on-call support during the update in case any issues arise.

Once we have this information, we can finalize an internal plan and communicate with our team accordingly.

Thank you for your assistance. We look forward to collaborating on a successful rollout.

Best regards,

Jane
Medical Administrative Assistant
Greenleaf Health Center
