  "email_content": "Hello Sunny Days families,\n\nThis week our classroom burst with color as the children worked together on a large mural. Each child added unique touches, illustrating themes of friendship and teamwork. Ask your little one about their favorite part of the mural \u2013 they\u2019re excited to share!\n\nWe\u2019ve also been talking about ways to continue building supportive peer connections. In the coming weeks we\u2019ll launch a child-friendly \u201cBuddy System\u201d that pairs students for shared activities and guided cooperative play. We\u2019ll send more details soon, including how you can reinforce the concept at home.\n\nReminders:\n\u2022 Please pack a labeled water bottle each day.\n\u2022 Weather is warming up; sun hats are welcome for outdoor play.\n\u2022 Our next Picture Day is mid-March; exact date and details will follow.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership. Have a wonderful weekend!\n\nWarmly,\nMiss Jane\nSunny Days Childcare Center",
