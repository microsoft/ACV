Hi Vitality Partners Team,

Hope you’re doing well. Following our recent conversations, I’m sharing OptiLife’s consolidated requirements for the HealthHub platform so we can move forward:

1. Seamless integration with our existing employee wellness initiatives (including data sync with current participation records and incentive tracking).
2. Capability to track individual employee health goals and display progress dashboards.
3. Delivery of personalized health insights and recommendations based on participant inputs and activity.
4. A diverse library of wellness challenges—both team-based and individual—to encourage sustained engagement.

Next steps
• Please confirm which of these items are available out-of-the-box and which would need additional configuration.
• Share an estimated timeline and any resources you’ll require from our IT team for integration.
• If possible, let’s schedule a brief sync call early next week to align on scope and responsibilities.

Thank you for your partnership. Let me know if you need anything else ahead of the call.

Best regards,
Jane
Health Program Coordinator | OptiLife Inc.
