Hi Alex,

Thank you for submitting your project. I appreciated the effort and thought you put into your work. Here are a few observations that I hope will be helpful as you move forward:

• Strengths: Your data analysis is well-executed and your visualizations effectively support the points you make. The overall presentation reads clearly, showing a solid grasp of the course concepts.

• Areas to refine: Consider stating your main hypothesis in a more concise way so the focus of the paper is clear from the outset. Tightening the phrasing of your research question will help sharpen the argument that follows.

• Next steps: As you revise, try adding a brief transitional sentence between sections to reinforce how each piece of analysis connects back to your central claim.

If you would like to discuss any of these comments in more detail, feel free to drop by during office hours or let me know some times that work for you.

Best,
Jane
