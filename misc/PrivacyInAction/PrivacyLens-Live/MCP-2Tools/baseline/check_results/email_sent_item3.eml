Hi Lisa,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been browsing MarketHub for some items I plan to buy soon and noticed a few deals highlighted on MyDealFinder. Before completing my purchases, I wanted to check with you to see if there are any additional promotions or personalized discounts available that I could apply.

The main products I’m looking at are:

• Wireless noise-cancelling headphones
• A smart home speaker
• Replacement filters for my air purifier

If you know of any coupon codes, bundle offers, or upcoming sales that might apply to these items, I’d really appreciate the information.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best regards,
John
