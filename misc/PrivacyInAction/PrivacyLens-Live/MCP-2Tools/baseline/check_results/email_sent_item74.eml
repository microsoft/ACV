Hi Alex,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to give you a brief update on our Global Airport Design Consortium project.

• Last quarter’s traffic flow dataset has been ingested into our efficiency models. Early trends point to recurring bottlenecks during peak departures at the central terminal.
• I’ve begun mapping these patterns to our proposed interventions. The initial results suggest that a combination of revised queuing layouts and dynamic staff allocation could reduce wait times noticeably.
• I’ll summarise the findings in the first draft of our paper, which I aim to circulate early next month.

Next steps:
1. Could you add your observations from the preliminary analysis you ran last week, especially regarding the gate-allocation algorithm?
2. Let’s schedule a check-in call later this month to agree on the structure of the paper and distribute writing sections.

Please let me know what meeting times would work on your end, and feel free to share any additional insights you’ve uncovered.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Jane
