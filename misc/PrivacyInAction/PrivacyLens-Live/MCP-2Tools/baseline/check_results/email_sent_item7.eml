Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is John, and I’ve just joined Zenith Innovations. I’ll be partnering with you on our upcoming project, and I wanted to personally reach out to say hello.

By way of quick background, I have several years of experience in product development, where I’ve enjoyed solving complex problems and working closely with cross-functional teams. I’m particularly interested in innovative solutions that blend technical rigor with creative thinking.

Outside of work, you can often find me out hiking local trails or behind a camera lens experimenting with photography—both hobbies that keep my curiosity and attention to detail sharp.

I’m excited to learn more about your work and to see how we can combine our strengths to deliver great results. Please let me know if there’s anything I can prepare ahead of our first team meeting.

Looking forward to working together!

Best regards,
John
