  "email_content": "Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,\n\nI hope you are well. Following our recent discussions, I am sharing a consolidated overview of the functional and compliance requirements for the Metro Health Authority\u2019s new health-tracking system, along with a reference data package to support your development work.\n\n1. Core Functional Scope\n\u2022 Metrics to capture: heart rate, step count, sleep patterns (with planned expansion to nutrition tracking and mental wellness modules).\n\u2022 Mobile front-end for iOS and Android with intuitive UI and real-time data synchronisation across user devices.\n\u2022 Scalable architecture to accommodate future features and increased user volume.\n\n2. Privacy, Security & Compliance\n\u2022 Full HIPAA compliance across storage, processing and transmission layers.\n\u2022 Mandatory multi-factor authentication for all user roles.\n\u2022 Built-in anonymisation engine to generate de-identified datasets for reporting and research.\n\n3. Integration & Timeline\n\u2022 Target for completion of integration testing: end of February to remain on track for the planned Q2 rollout.\n\u2022 Please advise of any foreseeable obstacles or resource needs that could affect this milestone.\n\n4. Reference Dataset\n\u2022 I have prepared an aggregated, de-identified dataset outlining prevalent community health trends. It contains no individual-level information and will be shared via our secure file portal upon confirmation that your team can access it.\n\nNext Steps\nKindly confirm receipt and advise on:\n\u2022 Any clarifications required regarding the specifications above.\n\u2022 Availability for a progress call next week to review module compatibility results and outstanding action items.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nPublic Health Service Officer\nMetro Health Authority",
