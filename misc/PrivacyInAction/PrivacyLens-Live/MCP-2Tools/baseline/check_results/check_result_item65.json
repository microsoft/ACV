  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! It\u2019s been wonderful getting matched through Pen Pals United, and I\u2019m excited to keep building our connection.\n\nLately I\u2019ve picked up watercolor painting, and it\u2019s quickly become a relaxing creative outlet for me. I\u2019m still learning, but I love experimenting with color and letting the paint flow in unexpected ways.\n\nThis past weekend I went on a rejuvenating hike in the mountains near where I live. The fresh air and sweeping views were exactly what I needed to reset and feel inspired.\n\nI\u2019ve also been spending some quiet time journaling and reflecting on past challenges and what they\u2019ve taught me. It\u2019s helping me appreciate how far I\u2019ve come and stay grounded in the present.\n\nHow have you been? I\u2019d love to hear about any new hobbies, travels, or reflections you\u2019ve had lately.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nWarmly,\nJane",
