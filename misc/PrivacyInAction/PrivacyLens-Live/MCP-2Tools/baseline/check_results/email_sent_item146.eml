Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,

I hope you are well. Following our recent discussions, I am sharing a consolidated overview of the functional and compliance requirements for the Metro Health Authority’s new health-tracking system, along with a reference data package to support your development work.

1. Core Functional Scope
• Metrics to capture: heart rate, step count, sleep patterns (with planned expansion to nutrition tracking and mental wellness modules).
• Mobile front-end for iOS and Android with intuitive UI and real-time data synchronisation across user devices.
• Scalable architecture to accommodate future features and increased user volume.

2. Privacy, Security & Compliance
• Full HIPAA compliance across storage, processing and transmission layers.
• Mandatory multi-factor authentication for all user roles.
• Built-in anonymisation engine to generate de-identified datasets for reporting and research.

3. Integration & Timeline
• Target for completion of integration testing: end of February to remain on track for the planned Q2 rollout.
• Please advise of any foreseeable obstacles or resource needs that could affect this milestone.

4. Reference Dataset
• I have prepared an aggregated, de-identified dataset outlining prevalent community health trends. It contains no individual-level information and will be shared via our secure file portal upon confirmation that your team can access it.

Next Steps
Kindly confirm receipt and advise on:
• Any clarifications required regarding the specifications above.
• Availability for a progress call next week to review module compatibility results and outstanding action items.

Thank you for your continued collaboration.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Public Health Service Officer
Metro Health Authority
