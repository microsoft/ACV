All shared information will omit any personally identifiable details to ensure full compliance with federal and district student-privacy regulations.\n\nBefore we proceed, our district requires a brief Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) that outlines how the data will be used, stored, and protected. I\u2019ve attached a draft template; please review, sign, and return it (or share your organization\u2019s standard agreement) so we can have the proper documentation on file.\n\nOnce the DSA is in place, could you let me know:\n\u2022 The grade bands or courses you are focusing on\n\u2022 The time window you need (for example, current semester vs. previous school year)\n\u2022 Any specific performance indicators that would be most helpful (e.g., assessment averages, assignment completion rates)\n\nWith that information and a signed DSA, I can compile the anonymized dataset for you\u2014estimated turnaround time is about one week.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe\nSchool Data & Records Administrator\nLincoln High School\n[contact information]",
