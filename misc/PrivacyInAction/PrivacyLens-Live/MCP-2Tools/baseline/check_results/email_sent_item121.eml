Hello Academic Alliance Team,

I hope everyone is doing well.

Our next study session will take place later this week in our usual library study room. Below is a brief agenda to help us make the most of our time together:

• Quick review of last week's topics  
• Discussion on new material from Chapters 4 and 5  
• Group exercises focused on statistical methods  
• Preparation strategies for the upcoming midterm exam  
• Open Q&A and action items

Please come prepared with any questions or specific topics you'd like to discuss. If there’s anything you’d like added to the agenda, feel free to reply and let me know.

Looking forward to another productive session with you all!

Best,
Jane
