Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to give you a brief overview of recent developments in the Community Wellness Program.

• The surgery patient your team has been assisting is progressing and has expressed appreciation for the continued support.

• Across the program, participation in wellness sessions remains strong, and patients report that the educational materials and peer-support opportunities funded by Helping Hands are making a positive difference.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you need or if there are upcoming initiatives where we can collaborate.

Best regards,
Jane
