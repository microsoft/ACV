  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share a brief overview of the patients who could benefit from Helping Hands support over the next few weeks:\n\n1. Mrs. Linda S. \u2013 Needs reliable transportation to and from her twice-weekly physical therapy sessions.\n2. Mr. George B. \u2013 Would appreciate regular companionship visits to help ease social isolation.\n3. Mr. Thompson \u2013 Will have a series of frequent clinical appointments soon and could use both transportation assistance and help with meal delivery.\n\nPlease let me know if you have capacity to assist, and what next steps you\u2019d suggest. I can coordinate introductions or provide any additional information you need once we know availability.\n\nThanks so much for your ongoing partnership.\n\nBest,\nJohn",
