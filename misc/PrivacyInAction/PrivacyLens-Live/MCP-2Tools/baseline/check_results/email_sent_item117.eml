Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in showcasing Greenfield University alumni.

Below is an initial highlight that might fit well with your feature:

• Marcus Antonelli – An engineering graduate who now leads community-focused technology projects and regularly volunteers with local non-profit organizations. He recently delivered the keynote address at our alumni gathering, sharing insights on community service and resilience.

I’m compiling additional profiles and can forward more brief summaries or arrange introductions once I have each alumnus’ permission. Please let me know if this direction fits your editorial needs or if you’re looking for something more specific.

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best regards,
John
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Greenfield University
