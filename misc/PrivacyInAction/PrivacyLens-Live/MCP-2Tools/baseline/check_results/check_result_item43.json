  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nThank you for stepping in to support Ethan. I wanted to pass along a few quick notes that should help you get to know him and plan the day smoothly:\n\n1. Daily rhythm\n   \u2022 Ethan does best with a predictable routine. His mornings usually include breakfast, some movement or light exercise, and puzzle time.\n   \u2022 After lunch he enjoys quieter activities like reading or listening to music, and he winds down with a favorite nature show before bedtime.\n\n2. Meals & snacks\n   \u2022 He prefers warm foods over cold ones.\n   \u2022 Favorite snacks: apple slices with a little peanut butter, or cheese and crackers.\n   \u2022 A calm, low-noise space during meals helps him stay relaxed and engaged.\n\n3. Favorite activities\n   \u2022 Anything with animals \u2013 visits to a zoo or watching animal videos.\n   \u2022 Water play and learning basic swimming skills.\n   \u2022 Drawing and painting; he has a small kit of art supplies he likes to use.\n\n4. Communication & sensory supports\n   \u2022 Ethan is practicing expressing his needs verbally and may ask for short breaks if things feel overwhelming.\n   \u2022 Gentle reminders and offering a quiet corner or headphones can help when the environment gets too loud.\n\n5. Transitions\n   \u2022 Countdown warnings (e.g., \u201cfive more minutes\u201d) and simple visual schedules work well for letting him know what\u2019s coming next.\n\nI hope this gives you a helpful starting point. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you\u2019d like more detail on anything.\n\nBest,\nJane",
