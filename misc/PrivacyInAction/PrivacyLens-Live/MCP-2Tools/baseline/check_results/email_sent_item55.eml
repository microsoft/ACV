Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve had a look at challenges like the one you described during past high-rise projects, so I’m happy to share a few pointers that might help accelerate your analysis:

1. Global load path
   • Start with a 3-D FEM model to verify that vertical and lateral loads are channelled cleanly from the super-structure to the foundation. This will highlight any unexpected torsional effects, especially around the outriggers.

2. Foundation bearing checks
   • For mat or piled raft options, combine service and ultimate states from the governing code (e.g., Eurocode 7 or ACI 318) and verify settlement under long-term creep. 
   • Double-check punching shear around core walls and heavily loaded columns; for SkyHigh-scale axial forces, the critical perimeter often ends up outside the column/shaft face by more than 2.0d.

3. Wind-induced overturning
   • Make sure the wind tunnel data is folded back into the foundation reactions with an appropriate gust factor. I usually run an envelope case with ±10 % extra moment to cover modelling uncertainty.

4. Soil–structure interaction
   • If you have subgrade modulus values from the latest geotech report, plug them into a coupled model; it tends to trim conservative estimates of differential settlement.

5. Performance-based review
   • The city reviewer usually asks for a separate performance-based appendix once the height crosses 250 m. The peer reviewers focus on robustness under rare combinations (seismic + accidental torsion + wind uplift), so it’s good to have those envelopes pre-calculated.

If useful, I’ve put together a concise summary that we used on a recent concept study; you can find it in our internal Notion page (“SkyHigh Tower Structural Analysis”). Feel free to copy anything that applies.

Let me know if you’d like to walk through the model setup or compare notes on the foundation options—I’m free Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.

Best,

Jane
