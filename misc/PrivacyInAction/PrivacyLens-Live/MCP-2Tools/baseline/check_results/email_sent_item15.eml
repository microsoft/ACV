Dear Dr. Strauss,

As requested, please find below the aggregated genetic-marker information derived from the population I counsel. All figures are fully de-identified and represent population-level summaries only.

• BRCA1 pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variant: approximately 5 % prevalence in the counseled population (n ≈ cohort-level figure available on request).

These data contain no individual-level identifiers or personal health information and are suitable for research use under standard ethical guidelines.

Please let me know if you need additional markers, demographic breakdowns, or a specific file format. I can provide a spreadsheet or other structured file once I have your preferred column headings.

Thank you, and I look forward to supporting the study.

Best regards,
Jane Doe, MS, CGC
Genetic Counselor
