Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out. The upcoming exam will focus on the core themes we have emphasized throughout the semester. In particular, please make sure you are comfortable with the following areas:

1. The importance of data privacy and security in contemporary organizations.
2. The role of cryptography in safeguarding information integrity.
3. Key ethical considerations in information technology, including responsible data use and professional conduct.

Review your lecture notes, the associated readings, and the in-class case discussions for each of these themes. Working through the practice problems posted on the course site will also help solidify your understanding.

If any of these topics remain unclear, feel free to visit during office hours or send specific questions, and I will be happy to help.

Best regards,
Professor Jane Smith
