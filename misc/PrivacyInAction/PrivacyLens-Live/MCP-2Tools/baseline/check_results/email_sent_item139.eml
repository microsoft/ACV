Hi Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out. Here is a concise overview of the key federal immigration changes that may be most relevant for our community:

• Increased visa numbers: The latest appropriations bill raised the annual cap for certain employment-based visas. This could benefit skilled workers who have been waiting in the backlog.

• New temporary protection option: A humanitarian measure has been introduced that allows people from regions currently facing significant political unrest to apply for a temporary protection status, granting work authorization and protection from removal for an initial period.

• Processing backlogs: Although application fees remain unchanged, the immigration agency has launched a streamlined online filing pilot for several forms, which should gradually reduce waiting times.

What this means for community members:

• Anyone who is eligible for an employment-based visa but was previously held back by the quota should consider updating their petitions soon.

• Individuals who may qualify for the new protection program should gather identity documents and proof of residence in the U.S., as these will likely be required.

• Keep documentation organized and monitor official agency announcements, as additional filing instructions are expected in the coming weeks.

Next steps:

I will prepare a short handout for the Alliance’s upcoming meeting that outlines these points and includes trusted government links. In the meantime, feel free to share this summary with the team, and let me know if you receive specific questions so I can address them directly or set up one-on-one consultations.

Best regards,

Jane
