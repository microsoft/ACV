Hi Mark,

As requested, here’s a concise overview of the key points for the Q2 budget forecast:

• Raw material costs are expected to rise ~5% due to ongoing market volatility.
• Negotiated price lists for Q2 have been updated following recent supplier discussions.
• Our planned shift toward more sustainable materials may affect unit costs.
• Detailed figures and the supplier-by-supplier breakdown can be found in the spreadsheet in our shared drive (Purchasing > Forecasts > Q2_2025_Budget_Forecast.xlsx).

Let me know if you’d like to walk through any of the assumptions or need additional info.

Best,
Jane
