Hi ConstructCo Solutions team,

I’m excited to officially kick-off our collaboration on the upcoming project. To get us underway, I’ve shared the following resources in our shared project workspace:
• Project overview and objectives
• High-level milestone schedule
• Material specification sheet

Next steps:
1. Please review the material specification and confirm any long-lead items that may require early procurement.
2. Share your preliminary questions or resourcing notes at your convenience.
3. Join our virtual kick-off meeting next week; I’ll circulate a calendar invite shortly.

If there’s anything else you need to get started, feel free to let me know. I’m looking forward to a successful partnership.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Civil Engineering Technician
