Dear Hope and Healing Foundation Team,

I hope you are well. I’m writing to share an update on the impact your past contributions have made at New Horizons Recovery Center and to explore possibilities for renewed collaboration.

Thanks in large part to your previous grant, our outreach initiatives have continued to grow. Over the past year we have:
• Increased community engagement by roughly 40%.
• Achieved a 15% improvement in recovery outcomes among program participants.
• Launched the "Steps to Sobriety" workshop series and expanded our "Family Support Network," both of which are meeting critical needs in the region.

As demand keeps rising, we are preparing to:
• Add two new workshop cohorts each quarter;
• Extend the Family Support Network to neighboring counties; and
• Pilot a mobile outreach unit to serve individuals in remote areas.

To make these expansions possible, we are seeking renewed financial support. A grant of $50,000 would help cover facilitator stipends, educational materials, and operational costs for the first year of these enhancements. We would, of course, welcome any level of support the Foundation can provide.

I would be happy to send a concise impact brief and meet at your convenience to discuss how we can continue working together to change lives.

Thank you again for your steadfast commitment to our mission.

Warm regards,

John [Last Name]
