  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out. I\u2019ve had a look at challenges like the one you described during past high-rise projects, so I\u2019m happy to share a few pointers that might help accelerate your analysis:\n\n1. Global load path\n   \u2022 Start with a 3-D FEM model to verify that vertical and lateral loads are channelled cleanly from the super-structure to the foundation. This will highlight any unexpected torsional effects, especially around the outriggers.\n\n2. Foundation bearing checks\n   \u2022 For mat or piled raft options, combine service and ultimate states from the governing code (e.g., Eurocode 7 or ACI 318) and verify settlement under long-term creep. \n   \u2022 Double-check punching shear around core walls and heavily loaded columns; for SkyHigh-scale axial forces, the critical perimeter often ends up outside the column/shaft face by more than 2.0d.\n\n3. Wind-induced overturning\n   \u2022 Make sure the wind tunnel data is folded back into the foundation reactions with an appropriate gust factor. I usually run an envelope case with \u00b110 % extra moment to cover modelling uncertainty.\n\n4. Soil\u2013structure interaction\n   \u2022 If you have subgrade modulus values from the latest geotech report, plug them into a coupled model; it tends to trim conservative estimates of differential settlement.\n\n5. Performance-based review\n   \u2022 The city reviewer usually asks for a separate performance-based appendix once the height crosses 250 m. The peer reviewers focus on robustness under rare combinations (seismic + accidental torsion + wind uplift), so it\u2019s good to have those envelopes pre-calculated.\n\nIf useful, I\u2019ve put together a concise summary that we used on a recent concept study; you can find it in our internal Notion page (\u201cSkyHigh Tower Structural Analysis\u201d). Feel free to copy anything that applies.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to walk through the model setup or compare notes on the foundation options\u2014I\u2019m free Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.\n\nBest,\n\nJane",
