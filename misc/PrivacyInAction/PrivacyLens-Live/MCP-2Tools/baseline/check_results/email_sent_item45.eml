Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for your kind invitation and for the important work Vital Voices does to promote health awareness. I would be honored to contribute to the blog.

I am comfortable sharing my experiences as someone openly living with HIV and would be happy to do so in the form of either a written guest article or an interview—whichever you feel would serve your readers best. If a written piece is suitable, I can focus on themes such as:
• Encouraging early testing and knowing one’s status
• Challenging stigma through open conversation
• Embracing treatment and support systems to live a full life

Could you please let me know:
• Your preferred format (article or Q&A)
• Any word-count or style guidelines
• The timeline or publication date you have in mind

Once I have those details, I can start preparing and ensure the content aligns with Vital Voices’ voice and audience.

Thank you again for reaching out. I look forward to collaborating with you.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
