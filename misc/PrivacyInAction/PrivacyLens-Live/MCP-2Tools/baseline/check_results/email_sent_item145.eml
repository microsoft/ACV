Hi Mark,

Thanks for raising the question about how we can continue to strengthen engagement in our courses. A few approaches have been especially helpful in my classes this term:

• Opening each session with a thought-provoking question to set the tone for discussion.
• Bringing in current real-world examples that connect theory to practice.
• Giving students brief opportunities to facilitate parts of the conversation— they seem to appreciate the shared ownership.

Since introducing regular discussion prompts and peer-review exchanges, I’ve noticed a meaningful uptick in participation and the overall energy in the room. Students appear more willing to volunteer thoughts and build on one another’s ideas.

If you’re interested, we could pilot a joint activity across our sections—perhaps an online discussion board around a cross-cutting theme in sociology—then compare notes on what resonates with different cohorts. I’d also be happy to swap lesson plans or observation notes to see where we might refine things further.

Let me know your thoughts and any strategies you’ve found effective. We could carve out a brief meeting next week to brainstorm.

Best,
Jane
