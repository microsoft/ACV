  "email_content": "Hi David,\n\nFollowing our recent discussions and my review of our current corporate tax audit workflow, I\u2019ve outlined several opportunities to further streamline our joint approach:\n\n1. Centralized digital document hub \u2013 Agree on a shared, secure repository for all taxpayer-provided records to reduce retrieval time and eliminate version confusion.\n\n2. Risk-based scoping \u2013 Use a standardized risk-scoring checklist up-front so that audit resources are concentrated on high-exposure areas and simpler sections move through quickly.\n\n3. Template library \u2013 Build a set of pre-approved information request and work-paper templates so teams spend less time drafting and more on analysis.\n\n4. Data analytics & automation \u2013 Identify repetitive tests (e.g., reconciliation of general ledger to returns) that can be automated using Excel scripting or Power BI to shorten fieldwork.\n\n5. Early issue resolution protocol \u2013 Schedule short \u201cquick-hit\u201d touchpoints with taxpayers during fieldwork to clear open questions before they snowball into re-work.\n\n6. Knowledge capture \u2013 After each engagement, conduct a 15-minute debrief to log lessons learned and update templates/process docs.\n\nNext steps\nIf these items look reasonable, let\u2019s prioritize the first two for a pilot on our upcoming cases. I\u2019m available for a call early next week to flesh out responsibilities and timing.\n\nThanks again for your partnership, and please let me know your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
