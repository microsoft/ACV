Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I’d like to share a quick roundup of upcoming changes that will affect our workspace and day-to-day processes.

Office Renovation
• A phased renovation of the ground-floor common areas will begin in the near future. During this period, workstations located there will be temporarily moved to the upper floors. Signage will guide you to the appropriate spaces, and we will keep noise and disruption to a minimum.
• Break-room amenities will also be relocated. Look for updated directions posted in the elevators and Slack.

Workstation & Accessibility Improvements
• Facilities is continuing its program to upgrade desks, chairs, monitors and related equipment.
• If you would benefit from ergonomic or accessibility adjustments, please complete the short request form in the Facilities portal or contact HR so we can address your needs promptly.

Workflow Transition: AgileBoost
• Over the next several weeks we will gradually adopt the AgileBoost platform for project tracking and collaboration.
• Team-based training sessions and quick-reference guides will roll out soon.
• A small pilot project will help us fine-tune settings before full adoption.

What to Expect Next
• A detailed renovation timetable and seating chart will be shared once finalized.
• Calendar invites for AgileBoost workshops will arrive shortly.
• Regular status emails will continue so you always know where things stand.

Thank you for your flexibility and teamwork as we improve our environment and processes. Please reach out to me or Facilities/HR with questions or concerns.

Best regards,
John
