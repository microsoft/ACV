  "email_content": "Dear Elaine,\n\nI hope you're well. Since our last meeting, we've consolidated survey and interview feedback from passengers regarding their experience in public areas across several terminals. Below is a concise summary of the latest findings:\n\n1. Security screening remains the most frequently cited stress point; respondents emphasized the need for clearer signage, more personal space, and a calmer environment to reduce anxiety.\n\n2. Less-monitored zones\u2014particularly restrooms and connecting corridors\u2014are perceived as safety blind spots. Passengers suggested improved lighting, visible staff presence, and discrete emergency call buttons.\n\n3. Overall, travelers value environments that balance efficiency with personal dignity. Design elements such as natural light, acoustic dampening, and intuitive wayfinding graphics were repeatedly noted as factors that foster a sense of calm and control.\n\n4. Respondents who have experienced or witnessed unsettling incidents in other transit settings reported heightened sensitivity to these factors in airports, underscoring the importance of an inclusive design approach.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 Map these insights to the Skyward Terminal layout to identify priority intervention zones.\n\u2022 Collaborate on designing an empathy-driven security queue prototype.\n\u2022 Prepare a short briefing for the wider project team ahead of next Thursday's workshop.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like me to pull additional data slices or schedule a quick call to discuss.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
