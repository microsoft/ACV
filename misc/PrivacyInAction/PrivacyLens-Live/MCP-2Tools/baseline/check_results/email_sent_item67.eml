Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for your continued guidance regarding international student regulations. I am writing to provide a concise summary of our department’s current compliance status.

• Policy review & faculty training: Following recent federal updates, we completed an internal policy review and circulated updated guidance to all faculty. A departmental training session clarified new requirements and procedures.

• Student record maintenance & SEVIS reporting: All active student records have been verified, and SEVIS reporting has been submitted on schedule. There are no outstanding alerts at this time.

• Enrollment monitoring: We now conduct weekly enrollment checks to ensure every international student maintains the full course load required by regulation. Automated alerts flag any potential under-enrollment for immediate follow-up.

• Visa support & advising: The advising team has adopted a standardized communication schedule that reminds students of key immigration milestones and directs them to campus resources for any needed assistance.

• Continuous improvement: We plan quarterly mini-audits in coordination with the university’s International Student & Scholar Services office to ensure that any future regulatory updates are integrated promptly.

Based on the measures above, we have not identified any compliance gaps this semester. Please let me know if you would like additional information or wish to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Best regards,

Professor Jane [Last Name]
