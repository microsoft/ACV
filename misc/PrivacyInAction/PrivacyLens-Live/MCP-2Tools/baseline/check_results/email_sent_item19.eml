Dear Mrs. Thompson,

I hope you are well. I’m writing to provide the summary you requested regarding Timmy’s current health status and immunizations.

• Overall health: Timmy has been stable and doing well in clinic follow-up visits. There have been no recent flare-ups of his chronic respiratory condition.
• Management plan: His daily preventive medication and as-needed rescue inhaler remain the same. Please ensure he has quick access to his inhaler at school.
• Vaccinations: Timmy is fully up to date with all routine childhood immunizations according to the state schedule. No additional doses are presently due.

Please let me know if the school needs formal forms or any additional information.

Thank you for helping keep Timmy healthy and safe at school.

Best regards,
Dr. Jane Doe
Happy Valley Children’s Clinic
