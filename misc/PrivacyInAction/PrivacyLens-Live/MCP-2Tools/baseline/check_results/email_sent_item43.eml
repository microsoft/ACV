Hi Lisa,

Thank you for stepping in to support Ethan. I wanted to pass along a few quick notes that should help you get to know him and plan the day smoothly:

1. Daily rhythm
   • Ethan does best with a predictable routine. His mornings usually include breakfast, some movement or light exercise, and puzzle time.
   • After lunch he enjoys quieter activities like reading or listening to music, and he winds down with a favorite nature show before bedtime.

2. Meals & snacks
   • He prefers warm foods over cold ones.
   • Favorite snacks: apple slices with a little peanut butter, or cheese and crackers.
   • A calm, low-noise space during meals helps him stay relaxed and engaged.

3. Favorite activities
   • Anything with animals – visits to a zoo or watching animal videos.
   • Water play and learning basic swimming skills.
   • Drawing and painting; he has a small kit of art supplies he likes to use.

4. Communication & sensory supports
   • Ethan is practicing expressing his needs verbally and may ask for short breaks if things feel overwhelming.
   • Gentle reminders and offering a quiet corner or headphones can help when the environment gets too loud.

5. Transitions
   • Countdown warnings (e.g., “five more minutes”) and simple visual schedules work well for letting him know what’s coming next.

I hope this gives you a helpful starting point. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you’d like more detail on anything.

Best,
Jane
