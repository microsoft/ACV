Hi Carlos,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, here are some practical, beginner-friendly steps that members of your community can follow to start establishing a positive credit history in the U.S.:

1. Start with a secured credit card
   • Offered by many banks and credit unions.
   • Requires a refundable cash deposit (often $200–$500) that sets the credit limit.
   • Make small purchases and pay the balance in full each month.

2. Consider a credit-builder loan
   • Available at community banks and credit unions.
   • The loan amount is held in a savings account while payments are made; once the loan is repaid, the funds are released.

3. Report on-time rent and utility payments
   • Services such as Experian Boost, eCredable, or RentTrack can add these payments to certain credit reports.

4. Become an authorized user (carefully)
   • If someone with strong credit adds a newcomer as an authorized user on an existing card and keeps balances low, the positive payment history can flow through.

5. Keep utilization low
   • Aim to use no more than 10–30 % of the available credit on any card.

6. Pay on time every month
   • Payment history makes up the largest share of most credit scoring models. Setting up automatic payments or calendar reminders helps avoid missed due dates.

7. Limit hard inquiries
   • Each new credit application generates a hard inquiry. Too many in a short time can lower a score.

8. Monitor credit reports regularly
   • Everyone is entitled to a free report from each major bureau every 12 months at AnnualCreditReport.com.
   • Review for errors (wrong name, addresses, duplicate accounts) and dispute mistakes promptly.

9. Build credit gradually and diversify later
   • After 6–12 months of on-time payments, consider adding a second revolving account or a small installment loan to broaden the credit profile.

Additional tips for recent immigrants:

• Social Security Number vs. ITIN: Lenders will usually require an SSN, but some secured-card programs and credit-builder loans accept an ITIN. Encouraging members to apply for an SSN when eligible can make future applications smoother.
• Language access: Many credit unions and nonprofit lenders provide bilingual support and financial education workshops—this can be less intimidating for first-time borrowers.

Feel free to share this list, and let me know if you’d like one-page handouts or a short webinar for your group. I’m happy to tailor the material further.

Best regards,
Jane
