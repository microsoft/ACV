  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you're doing well. As we move closer to Community Care Day on March 15 at St. Mary's Parish Hall and grounds, I wanted to share a brief update and outline the next steps so we stay aligned.\n\n1. Volunteer roster\n- Helping Hands United volunteers are confirmed \u2013 thank you!\n- We are finalizing the parish volunteer list this week and will circulate the consolidated roster once complete.\n\n2. Program highlights\n- Free meal distribution, clothing pantry, basic health screenings, local-business job fair, and family activities are all on the schedule.\n- Opening remarks will kick off the day, followed by service stations operating continuously.\n\n3. Logistics\n- Parish hall booking is in progress; I will confirm as soon as the board signs off.\n- We are arranging additional tables/chairs for the job-fair area.\n- If your team has any equipment needs, please let me know.\n\n4. Promotion\n- Draft flyers are ready for printing and community distribution.\n- Announcements are slated for upcoming church services.\n- Social-media posts from Helping Hands United later this month would be perfect; happy to provide wording or graphics.\n\nNext meeting\nCould we set up a brief call early next week to review final details and the run-of-show?\n\nThank you again for partnering with us to serve our neighbors. Please let me know if there\u2019s anything else you need in the meantime.\n\nBlessings,\nJohn",
