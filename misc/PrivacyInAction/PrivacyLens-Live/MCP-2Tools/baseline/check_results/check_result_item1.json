Integrating the two could bridge insight and action.\n\n\u2022 Practical implementation ideas:\n  \u2013 Begin sessions with brief mindful check-ins to ground clients before introducing behavioral tasks.\n  \u2013 Use acceptance exercises to reduce avoidance, then transition into IBF\u2019s activity scheduling or exposure hierarchies.\n  \u2013 Track outcomes with simple self-report scales to evaluate whether the combined protocol yields improved adherence and symptom reduction.\n\n\u2022 Training considerations: We noted the importance of therapist competency in both mindfulness facilitation and behavioral planning. A phased training model\u2014starting with experiential mindfulness workshops followed by IBF skill-building\u2014might be effective.\n\n\u2022 Next steps: We considered piloting this integrated approach with a small group of clinicians at our respective centers and sharing preliminary observations in an upcoming peer-reviewed piece or conference workshop.\n\nLet me know if I captured everything accurately or if you'd like to add anything. Looking forward to our continued collaboration.\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn",
