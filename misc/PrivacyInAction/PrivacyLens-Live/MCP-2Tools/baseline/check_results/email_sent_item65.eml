Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s been wonderful getting matched through Pen Pals United, and I’m excited to keep building our connection.

Lately I’ve picked up watercolor painting, and it’s quickly become a relaxing creative outlet for me. I’m still learning, but I love experimenting with color and letting the paint flow in unexpected ways.

This past weekend I went on a rejuvenating hike in the mountains near where I live. The fresh air and sweeping views were exactly what I needed to reset and feel inspired.

I’ve also been spending some quiet time journaling and reflecting on past challenges and what they’ve taught me. It’s helping me appreciate how far I’ve come and stay grounded in the present.

How have you been? I’d love to hear about any new hobbies, travels, or reflections you’ve had lately.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Warmly,
Jane
