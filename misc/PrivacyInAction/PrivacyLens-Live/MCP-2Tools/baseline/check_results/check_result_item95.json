Please find below the requested background information to help your team proceed:\n\n1. Customer Satisfaction\n   \u2013 Our latest survey confirms that customers remain broadly satisfied with our services. The feedback highlights opportunities to improve transaction speed and mobile usability while maintaining strong security.\n\n2. Branch Performance\n   \u2013 Transaction volumes and service ratings have shown steady improvement across our branches. System response times during peak periods are the main performance constraint we aim to address.\n\n3. Compliance Considerations\n   \u2013 We will share relevant compliance requirements once the mutual NDA is in place.\n\n4. Current Digital Infrastructure\n   \u2013 We operate a centralized legacy platform built around an on-premise relational database and monolithic transaction-processing application. Our key upgrade priorities include:\n        \u2022 Enhanced security and encryption\n        \u2022 Reduced latency for high-volume transactions\n        \u2022 Scalable, microservice-ready architecture\n        \u2022 Seamless integration with existing customer-facing channels\n\nIf you need additional context or would like to arrange a call to discuss technical specifics, please let me know. More detailed documentation can be provided through our secure portal once the NDA is finalized.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating on this project.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nBank Manager | Trustworthy Banking Group",
