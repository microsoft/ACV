Upcoming Legal Clinic\n\u2022 Registration has reached full capacity, so please let participants know that no additional slots are available. Remind everyone who is already registered to bring any relevant documents and to arrive a little early so we can stay on schedule.\n\n2. Educational Workshops\n\u2022 The workshop series with the Immigrant Aid Society is confirmed for the first week of March. These sessions will focus on helping newcomers understand their rights and the legal process. I\u2019ll send you the finalized flyer shortly so you can circulate it.\n\n3. Individual Case Follow-Up\n\u2022 Carlos\u2019s matter is progressing. We have a strategy session scheduled soon to outline the next steps. I\u2019ll share more details once we\u2019ve finalized the plan.\n\nThank you, as always, for passing this information along and supporting the community.\n\nBest,\nJohn\n",
