Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand that hearing rumors can be unsettling.

At this time, there have been no formal announcements of organizational changes that would affect project teams or individual roles. Leadership is committed to keeping everyone informed and will share verified information as soon as it becomes available.

If anything is communicated officially, you can expect to hear it through the usual channels—company-wide emails, the next town hall, and direct updates from your department head. In the meantime, please continue focusing on your current projects. Should any confirmed information come my way that I am able to share, I will let you know promptly.

If you have any immediate concerns about your team’s workload or staffing, feel free to set up a time with me and we can discuss them in more detail.

Best,
Jane
