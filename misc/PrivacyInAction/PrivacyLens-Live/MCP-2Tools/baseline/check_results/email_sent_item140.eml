Hi there,

Hope you’re doing well. Following our recent conversations, I’m sharing NexTech’s high-level requirements and timeline for the new Performance Tracking System:

1. Core Functionality
   • Real-time metrics: Project completion rates, sales target progress, service response times.
   • Customizable dashboards: End-users should be able to select the KPIs most relevant to their roles.
   • HRIS integration: Seamless data exchange with our existing HR system to keep performance data and employee records in sync.

2. Security & Privacy
   • Role-based access controls.
   • Data encryption in transit and at rest.
   • Compliance with all applicable data-protection regulations.

3. Implementation Timeline
   • Development kickoff: early next quarter.
   • Internal pilot: about six months after kickoff, incorporating user feedback before wider rollout.

4. Deliverables
   • Technical architecture overview.
   • Integration plan with HRIS.
   • Prototype dashboards for key user groups.
   • Testing and training plan.

Please confirm these points align with your team’s current understanding and let us know if you need additional information. We’d also appreciate a brief project plan outlining milestones and resource needs ahead of our next sync call.

Thank you for your partnership. Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
