  "email_content": "Hello MedTech Innovations Team,\n\nThank you for deploying the new patient-management system. Our clinicians appreciate its user-friendly interface and streamlined navigation.\n\nBelow are a few observations and recommendations from everyday use at Harmony Health Clinic:\n\n1. Medication scheduling flexibility  \n   \u2022 Please consider adding customizable repeat patterns (e.g., every X days, specific weekdays, alternating weeks) to better handle complex medication schedules.  \n   \u2022 Allowing dose adjustments within the same prescription cycle would reduce manual workarounds.\n\n2. Therapy & appointment scheduling  \n   \u2022 Many of our clients receive multiple therapies each week (e.g., behavioral, speech, occupational). A template-based scheduler that can accommodate recurring sessions with variable frequency would improve workflow efficiency.\n\n3. Outcome analytics  \n   \u2022 Having built-in dashboards that track aggregated outcome measures over time would be valuable. Since adopting your system, we have seen roughly a 20 % improvement in documented clinical outcomes and would love to visualize this trend directly in the platform.\n\nWe appreciate your continued partnership and are happy to provide additional detail or participate in user-testing sessions.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nHarmony Health Clinic",
