Hi Maria,

Hope you’re doing well.

Here’s a quick run-through of what you need to do to get access to the shared resource for your project and keep things moving:

Access steps
1. Submit an access request through the HelpDesk portal. In the form, choose “Marketing – Shared Resources” from the dropdown and reference your current campaign.
2. Once you submit, you’ll receive an automated ticket number. Reply to that ticket with a brief note confirming your TechSolutions user ID so we can verify your identity.
3. After verification, IT will grant the appropriate read/write permissions and notify you. Expect the turnaround to be within one business day after we receive your confirmation.
4. When you log in the first time, the system will prompt you to set up multi-factor authentication. Please complete that step right away; it’s required before any files become visible.
5. Finally, open the shared drive, navigate to the “Marketing-Campaign-Assets” folder, and you should see everything you need.

Project action reminders (high-level)
• Finalize the ad copy in early March.
• Secure media placements by the middle of the month.
• Schedule social media posts to start later in March.
• Begin preparations for the product-launch event slated for early April, coordinating with Sales so messaging stays in sync.

Let me know if you run into any issues or need more help.

Best,
John
IT Administrator
