Hi Sarah,

Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief snapshot of what we’ve been up to at St. Mary’s over the past few weeks and touch base about the upcoming community charity event we’re planning for mid-March.

Recent parish outreach highlights
• Weekly food pantry: we’re serving about 50 local families each Tuesday evening, with a few new volunteers joining our rotations.
• Winter coat drive: collected over 120 coats which were distributed through the community center last weekend.
• Youth group service project: our teens recently spent a morning cleaning up a local park and assembling care packages for our seniors.

Charity Event – Mid-March
• Theme & purpose: A day of community service and engagement, raising funds for neighborhood support programs.
• Activities in planning: morning neighborhood clean-up, midday family fun fair, afternoon benefit concert, and closing silent auction.
• Volunteers: parish members, local high-school clubs, and we’d love to coordinate Helping Hands volunteers as well.
• Next steps: We’re drafting the detailed schedule and would value your input on volunteer roles, promotional outreach, and best practices for tracking donations to keep everything transparent and well-documented.

Are you available for a brief call next week to align our teams? Please let me know what times might work for you.

Thank you for partnering with us again, Sarah. Together we can make a real difference.

Blessings,

John
St. Mary’s Parish
