Dear Mr. Harrison,

As requested, please find below a concise overview of InnoTech Solutions’ current corporate compliance policies that are relevant to the Commission’s ongoing review:

• Code of Conduct & Ethics: outlines expectations for legal and ethical behavior across all operations. (Last updated early this year)
• Regulatory Compliance Program: centralised framework ensuring adherence to SOC, SOX, and other applicable regulations, including periodic self-assessments and external audits.
• Anti-Corruption & Bribery Policy: zero-tolerance stance with mandatory training and annual certifications for employees and third-party intermediaries.
• Data Protection & Privacy Policy: governs collection, processing, retention, and disposal of personal data in line with federal privacy requirements.
• Whistle-blower & Non-Retaliation Policy: confidential reporting channels managed by the Compliance Office with clear investigative procedures.
• Risk Assessment & Monitoring Procedure: quarterly risk mapping, control testing, and escalation protocols overseen by the Compliance Committee.
• Third-Party Due Diligence Standard: screening and onboarding requirements for suppliers and partners to mitigate compliance risks.

Additional materials:
A full copy of each policy, together with the most recent compliance report and supporting audit logs, have been uploaded to the secure SOC document portal under reference number ITS-COMP-2025-04. Please let me know if you encounter any access issues.

If you require further detail or would like to discuss any aspect of the program, I would be happy to arrange a call at your convenience.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
