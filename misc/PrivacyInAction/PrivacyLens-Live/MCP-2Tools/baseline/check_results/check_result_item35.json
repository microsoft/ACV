  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out. In line with our data-sharing agreement and Union Trust Bank\u2019s confidentiality policies, I\u2019m pleased to provide the latest aggregated customer insights to support your engagement analysis.\n\nKey highlights (April 2025 snapshot):\n\u2022 Customers aged roughly 25\u201340 represent about 38 % of our active base, with an estimated median monthly spend of approximately $2.8 k.\n\u2022 Mobile-banking adoption is strongest among customers under 30; about 72 % of that segment complete at least half of their transactions in the app.\n\u2022 Mortgage and auto loans together account for roughly 45 % of total loan balances.\n\u2022 Debit-card usage rose around 18 % year-over-year, likely driven by increased contactless payments.\n\nThese figures are fully anonymised and consolidated at portfolio level, ensuring that no individual customer or account can be identified. If you require additional aggregate metrics\u2014such as spend distribution by merchant category or product-level engagement trends\u2014please let me know and I\u2019ll work with our analytics team to prepare them.\n\nFor privacy reasons we are unable to share raw transaction-level data or individual account balances. However, we can create further summaries or statistical breakdowns tailored to your modelling needs.\n\nLet me know if this dataset meets your requirements or if we should arrange a brief call to discuss next steps.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe\nCustomer Service Representative\nUnion Trust Bank",
