As we look ahead to our upcoming collaboration, I\u2019d love to explore some fresh ways we can expand our donor base and inspire repeat giving.\n\nA few initial ideas:\n\u2022 Launch a virtual community challenge (e.g., fitness or creative) with a modest sign-up gift that directs proceeds to our joint programs.\n\u2022 Host a streamed concert or showcase featuring local talent and highlight impact stories during intermissions.\n\u2022 Organize a community art auction, inviting supporters to donate artwork and bid online.\n\u2022 Roll out a recurring-giving drive paired with a simple donor-recognition program to cultivate ongoing support.\n\u2022 Run a short social-media challenge aimed at engaging younger supporters and encouraging peer-to-peer fundraising.\n\nI\u2019d welcome your thoughts and any concepts your team has been considering. Would you be available next week for a brief call to brainstorm and outline an action plan?\n\nLooking forward to working together to make this our most successful campaign yet.\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn",
