Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you. Below is a broad overview of the approach we typically follow when preparing and filing motions in state court, minus any client-specific detail:

1. Confirm governing rules: Review the local rules, judge’s standing orders, and the most recent amendments. Pay close attention to page limits, formatting requirements, and electronic filing protocols.

2. Filing deadlines and timing: Map out all applicable response and reply periods early. If strategic advantage is a priority, consider whether filing at the opening of the window or closer to the deadline best serves your objectives.

3. Structure: We generally keep a concise introduction stating the precise relief sought, followed by a factual background section and then argument headings keyed to the governing legal standards. Always include a proposed order for the court’s convenience.

4. Supporting materials: Prepare affidavits, exhibits, and a detailed certificate of service concurrently so nothing delays the filing. Where appropriate, attach a brief declaration explaining why the record supports the requested relief.

5. Service and courtesy copies: Double-check whether chambers require courtesy copies (and the format) and whether e-service or hand delivery is mandated.

6. Oral argument: If you believe oral argument could move the needle, add a short request in the conclusion with a brief rationale framed around efficiency or clarity.

7. Follow-up calendar: Set reminders for potential supplemental briefing or meet-and-confer obligations that could be triggered after filing.

If a template or checklist would be useful, let me know and I can share a redacted version.

Hope this helps, and I’m happy to discuss further.

Best regards,
Jane
