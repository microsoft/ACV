  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for your kind words. I\u2019m happy to help strengthen your pending patent application.\n\nBelow are several proven practices I recommend:\n\n1. Solid prior-art search: Thoroughly search patent databases, scientific literature, and market products to confirm novelty. Keep records of what you find and how your invention differs.\n\n2. Clear problem/solution framing: Start the specification with the technical problem and the way your invention addresses it. Examiners appreciate a concise narrative.\n\n3. Thoughtful claim strategy:\n   \u2022 Draft the broadest independent claim that still distinguishes over prior art.\n   \u2022 Add dependent claims that capture fallback positions and key commercial embodiments.\n   \u2022 Use precise, consistent terminology; define any relative terms.\n\n4. Robust embodiments: Provide multiple working examples and variations. This supports enablement and can make your patent more resilient.\n\n5. Examiner-aligned presentation: Review published patents handled by the art unit likely to examine your case. Note stylistic patterns (e.g., level of detail) and mirror that structure when possible.\n\n6. Acceleration options: If speed is critical, we can evaluate programs like USPTO Track One prioritized examination or the Patent Prosecution Highway.\n\n7. Future-proofing: Consider potential continuations or international filings. Including broader and alternative embodiments now keeps avenues open later.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 If you\u2019d like, share your current draft or a claim outline, and I can provide targeted feedback.\n\u2022 We can also schedule a short call this week to discuss your commercial goals and refine the strategy.\n\nLet me know what works best for you. I\u2019m looking forward to helping you move forward.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
