  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nIt was a pleasure meeting you recently over coffee. As promised, I\u2019m sending over a concise collection of ideas I use in my creative-writing classes at Oakwood University. I hope these spark some inspiration or adapt well to your own teaching or writing practice:\n\n1. Warm-Up \u201cFlash Freewrites\u201d\n   \u2022 We begin each session with a 5-minute freewrite on a quirky prompt (e.g., \u201cThe sound that changed everything\u201d). It lowers the stakes, switches students into drafting mode, and often seeds longer pieces.\n\n2. \u201cShow, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d Revisions\n   \u2022 After an initial draft, students highlight all abstract emotion words (happy, scared, etc.). They then replace at least half with concrete sensory cues. The exercise makes the difference between stating a feeling and evoking it.\n\n3. Scene-Summary Ladder\n   \u2022 Writers map their narrative on a ladder: rungs labeled Scene (fully dramatized), Summary (condensed narration), and Reflection (authorial commentary). Visualizing placement helps them modulate pacing consciously.\n\n4. Character Interviews\n   \u2022 Students interview their protagonists as if on a podcast. Writing in Q&A form reveals hidden motivations and moral contradictions that rarely emerge in standard outlines.\n\n5. Peer Workshop \u201cGlow & Grow\u201d Sheets\n   \u2022 Responders jot one element that glowed (worked well) and one area to grow (clarify, sharpen, re-focus). The simple framework encourages balanced, actionable feedback.\n\n6. Revision Passport\n   \u2022 Before submitting a final piece, students attach a short note describing three concrete revisions they made and why. It turns revision into a visible, reflective act rather than a hidden last-minute tweak.\n\nFeel free to adapt, remix, or toss any of these. If you\u2019d like additional resources\u2014reading lists, prompt banks, or rubrics\u2014let me know and I\u2019d be happy to share.\n\nLooking forward to hearing how your own teaching experiments evolve!\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn\nProfessor, Creative Writing\nOakwood University",

Through this struggle, I learned the value of perseverance and the importance of seeking help when needed.'",
