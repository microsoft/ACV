Dear Oakwood Owlet Parents,

I hope you are all doing well. I’m excited to share that our class will soon begin a collaborative group project that will span the next few weeks. To help the students succeed, I’d like to coordinate with you on materials, volunteer support, and general timelines.

Overview:
• Theme: Exploring local ecosystems (science focus with art and writing components)
• Student tasks: research, create visual display, present findings to peers

Proposed support from home:
1. Materials: simple recyclables (shoe boxes, paper towel rolls, magazines, etc.). If you have extras to donate, please send them in with your child by early next month.
2. Volunteer assistance: If you are available to help supervise small groups during one of our in-class work sessions, please reply with your preferred date(s) and time(s).
3. Practice presentations: Encourage your child to rehearse their explanation at home once drafts are complete.

Next steps:
• I will share a sign-up sheet for volunteer slots and material donations later this week.
• Our class presentation will take place toward the middle of next month; exact day will follow once confirmed with the school calendar.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Your partnership is invaluable, and I appreciate everything you do to support our young learners.

Warm regards,
Jane (Ms. Doe)
