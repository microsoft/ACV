Minor discrepancies identified in the preliminary pass have been resolved, and the final report is on track to be ready for review by the end of this week.\n\n\u2022 Quarterly Budget Review: The review has been finalized. Overall expenditure was reduced by roughly 5%, resulting in a surplus that can potentially be allocated to upcoming R&D initiatives. All departmental submissions were received on schedule, and the consolidation process went smoothly.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 Compile the final reconciliation report and circulate it for sign-off.\n\u2022 Prepare summary slides on budget findings for the leadership meeting next week.\n\u2022 Begin scenario planning for potential reinvestment options based on the surplus.\n\nPlease let me know if any additional information is needed.\n\nThank you,\nJohn",
