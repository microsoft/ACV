  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well! I wanted to share a quick update on Prestige University\u2019s most recent admissions cycle, since I know you like to stay connected with developments on campus.\n\n\u2022 Applications were up by roughly 5%, bringing the total applicant pool to about 15,000.\n\u2022 With that increased interest, our acceptance rate declined slightly to around 7%, resulting in a first-year class of just over 1,000 students.\n\u2022 The incoming cohort is our most globally diverse yet, representing students from more than 60 countries and every major region of the United States.\n\u2022 Academic indicators remain very strong. The middle range of standardized test scores continues to be in the top percentiles nationally, and we\u2019re seeing ever-growing interest in interdisciplinary programs such as data science, environmental studies, and public health.\n\u2022 Beyond academics, the admitted class brings an impressive mix of community service, entrepreneurial projects, artistic pursuits, and athletic achievements.\n\nLooking ahead, we\u2019ll be reaching out to alumni with ways to welcome the new students\u2014everything from virtual mentorship opportunities to regional send-off gatherings later this summer. I\u2019ll keep you posted as those plans firm up.\n\nThanks, as always, for your interest and support of the Prestige community. If you have any questions, or if there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019d like to know, feel free to let me know.\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn\nAlumni Relations Coordinator\nPrestige University",
