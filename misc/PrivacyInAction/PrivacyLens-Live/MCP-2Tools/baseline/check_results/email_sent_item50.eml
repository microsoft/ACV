Hi Mark,

Thanks for looping me in! I’d love to help with Alex’s surprise.

• Timing: Early in the first week of March should work well. An evening mid-week might be the safest bet, but I’m flexible—let me know what fits best with everyone’s schedules.

• Venue ideas: We could reserve a private room at a downtown restaurant so we have space and privacy. If you have another location in mind, let me know and I can make inquiries and handle the booking.

• Guest list: I’m thinking around 15–20 people, including a few of Alex’s friends from outside work. I can manage the invitations once the date’s confirmed.

• Gift: How about pooling funds for a rugged smartwatch that’s designed for first responders? It feels useful and meaningful. I’m happy to coordinate the group gift if the team is interested.

Let me know what you think or if there’s anything else you need.

Excited to make this happen!

Best,
Jane
