Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out to confirm Grandview University’s adherence to federal disability-accommodation regulations. I appreciate the opportunity to outline our current practices and resources.

Overview of Our Accommodation Framework
• Governance – All disability accommodations are administered through the Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS). OSAS reviews documentation, determines reasonable accommodations, and issues formal letters to students and instructors.
• Range of Supports – Common accommodations include extended exam time, distraction-reduced testing spaces, note-taking assistance, captioned or sign-language-interpreted lectures, accessible digital materials that meet WCAG standards, adjustable-height workstations, and adaptive software or devices.
• Faculty Coordination – Instructors receive an accommodation letter at the start of each term and are required to meet all listed adjustments. The Center for Teaching Excellence runs ongoing faculty workshops on creating accessible course content and classroom environments.
• Monitoring & Review – Compliance is monitored jointly by OSAS and the Provost’s Office through mid-term check-ins, periodic syllabus audits, and an annual policy review aligned with Section 504 and ADAAA guidance.
• Appeals Process – Students may appeal accommodation decisions through a committee chaired by the Dean of Students, ensuring due process and timely resolution.

Recent Enhancements
• We updated our Learning Management System templates this year to improve screen-reader navigation and add automatic captioning for uploaded media.
• A new campus-wide procurement checklist now requires all academic software vendors to provide VPAT documentation before purchase approval.

Requested Documentation
Please let me know which specific materials you would like for your audit (e.g., policy statements, training outlines, anonymized accommodation statistics). I will compile them promptly.

Feel free to contact me with any additional questions or to schedule a meeting.

Sincerely,
John [Last Name]
Professor, Department of _______
