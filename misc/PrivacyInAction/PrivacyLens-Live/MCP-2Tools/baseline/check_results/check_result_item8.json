I remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.\n\nAfter researching current market rates and reflecting on my experience leading projects and mentoring developers, I believe that a base salary in the range of $125,000\u2013$135,000 per year, together with a standard performance-based bonus structure and benefits, would be appropriate.\n\nThat said, I value the overall fit and growth potential highly, and I\u2019m open to discussing the details further to arrive at a package that works well for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe",
