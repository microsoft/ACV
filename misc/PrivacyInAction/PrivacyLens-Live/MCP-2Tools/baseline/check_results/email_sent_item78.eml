Hi Elizabeth,

I’ve compiled the latest findings from our ongoing study of remote learning and student performance.

Key takeaways:
• Student performance shows a modest improvement overall compared to pre-study baseline, with notable gains in asynchronous learning modules.
• Attendance and engagement rates have remained steady around the high-70s to low-80s percentile range across most cohorts.
• Qualitative feedback indicates that flexibility and recorded lectures are primary factors in improved satisfaction.
• Initial geospatial analysis suggests students in areas with limited broadband report more connectivity disruptions, which correlates with slightly lower engagement scores.
• We are preparing a more detailed technical memo (with de-identified data) for submission to the review board next week.

Next steps:
• Finalize the cleaned dataset and statistical models.
• Draft the discussion section focusing on pedagogical implications.
• Schedule a check-in later this week to divide writing tasks for the upcoming conference paper.

Please let me know if you’d like anything expanded or adjusted.

Best,
John
