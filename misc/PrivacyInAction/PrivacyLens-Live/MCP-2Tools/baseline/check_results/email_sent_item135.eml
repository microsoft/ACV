Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re well. I’m reaching out to discuss a project I’m developing – a community sports program designed to engage local youth through inclusive, multi-sport activities. The initiative focuses on teamwork, discipline, and encouraging an active lifestyle.

Given the Active Youth Foundation’s mission, I believe there’s strong alignment and potential for us to collaborate. I’d love to explore how we might work together on areas such as participant outreach, event logistics, volunteer coordination, and securing resources for equipment and facilities.

I have drafted a proposal outlining the program’s objectives, structure, and tentative timeline. I’d be happy to share this document and hear your thoughts. Would you be available for a brief call or meeting next week to discuss possibilities?

Thank you for considering this partnership. I’m excited about the impact we could make together.

Best regards,
John
