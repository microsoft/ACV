Hi Michael,

I hope you're well. Here are the most recent developments on our active joint cases:

• Case 001 – The household has successfully transitioned into stable housing. We'll continue monitoring to ensure needs are met during this adjustment period.

• Case 002 – The household's enrollment in the food assistance program is now confirmed, and benefits should begin shortly. We'll follow up to confirm receipt.

• Case 003 – The application for medical aid is currently under review by the provider. We'll share any decisions or requests for additional information as soon as we receive them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to support our collaboration.

Thank you for your continued partnership.

Best regards,
Jane
