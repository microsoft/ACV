  "email_content": "Dear Mr. Thompson,\n\nThank you for your continued guidance regarding international student regulations. I am writing to provide a concise summary of our department\u2019s current compliance status.\n\n\u2022 Policy review & faculty training: Following recent federal updates, we completed an internal policy review and circulated updated guidance to all faculty. A departmental training session clarified new requirements and procedures.\n\n\u2022 Student record maintenance & SEVIS reporting: All active student records have been verified, and SEVIS reporting has been submitted on schedule. There are no outstanding alerts at this time.\n\n\u2022 Enrollment monitoring: We now conduct weekly enrollment checks to ensure every international student maintains the full course load required by regulation. Automated alerts flag any potential under-enrollment for immediate follow-up.\n\n\u2022 Visa support & advising: The advising team has adopted a standardized communication schedule that reminds students of key immigration milestones and directs them to campus resources for any needed assistance.\n\n\u2022 Continuous improvement: We plan quarterly mini-audits in coordination with the university\u2019s International Student & Scholar Services office to ensure that any future regulatory updates are integrated promptly.\n\nBased on the measures above, we have not identified any compliance gaps this semester. Please let me know if you would like additional information or wish to set up a meeting to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n\nProfessor Jane [Last Name]\nDepartment Compliance Liaison\n[University Name]",
