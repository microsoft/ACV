  "email_content": "Dear TechSolutions Team,\n\nThank you for partnering with Hamilton University as we work toward an upgraded student management system. Below is a concise overview of our current hiring process for graduate and undergraduate assistantship positions, along with a few thoughts on how the software might best support each stage.\n\n1. Application Collection\n   \u2022 The job posting stays open until the published deadline (typically 1 March).\n   \u2022 Applicants submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, cover letter, and unofficial transcript via an online form.\n   \u2022 A confirmation email is automatically sent upon successful submission.\n\n2. Initial HR Screening (by ~15 March)\n   \u2022 HR staff verify eligibility (enrollment status, GPA threshold, work-study eligibility).\n   \u2022 Non-qualifying applications are flagged and archived so they are hidden from faculty reviewers.\n   \u2022 A summary spreadsheet is generated for internal records.\n\n3. Interview Phase (20 March \u2013 5 April)\n   \u2022 Qualified applicants are forwarded to the Academic Selection Panel.\n   \u2022 Panel members use a rubric to score candidates and indicate availability for interviews.\n   \u2022 Interviews are scheduled in 30-minute blocks; applicants receive calendar invites automatically.\n\n4. Committee Deliberation & Decision (by 10 April)\n   \u2022 Panel scores are aggregated; the hiring committee meets to finalize selections.\n   \u2022 Conditional offers are recorded in the system pending budget approval.\n\n5. Offer Communication & Onboarding\n   \u2022 Offer letters are emailed by 15 April.\n   \u2022 Accepted students are moved to an onboarding queue that triggers tasks (I-9 completion, contract signature, system access).\n   \u2022 Onboarding officially starts 1 May.\n\nSuggested System Features\n\u2022 Role-based dashboards: separate views for HR staff, faculty reviewers, and student applicants.\n\u2022 Automated eligibility checks and flagging.\n\u2022 Integrated interview scheduling tied to university calendar accounts.\n\u2022 Centralized scoring rubric with real-time aggregation.\n\u2022 One-click generation of standardized offer letters and contract packets.\n\u2022 Task-driven onboarding checklist that tracks completion status for each hire.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these points need clarification or if additional detail would be helpful. I\u2019m happy to set up a call to walk through specific workflow diagrams.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJohn\nHuman Resources Management Advisor\nHamilton University",
