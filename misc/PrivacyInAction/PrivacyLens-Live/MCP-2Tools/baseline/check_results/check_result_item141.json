I'm excited to kick off the cover design for Clara Bellamy's upcoming novel, \"Whispers of the Past.\"  \n\nKey creative direction:\n\u2022 Mood: Mystery blended with a touch of nostalgia  \n\u2022 Key visuals: An old, ornate key and a faded handwritten letter  \n\u2022 Palette: Muted earth tones \u2013 weathered browns, deep greens, antique creams  \n\u2022 Overall feel: Timeless, slightly worn, hinting at long-buried secrets\n\nI'll share the manuscript synopsis and Clara's short author bio separately so you have extra context while brainstorming.\n\nLet me know if you need any additional details or reference images. Looking forward to seeing your initial concepts.\n\nBest,\nJane\nSenior Editor | Griffin & Locke Publishing House",
