Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference and chatting about emerging tech trends. I really enjoyed our discussion around AI advancements, quantum computing, and blockchain applications.

I’ve gathered a few articles and whitepapers that dive deeper into these areas. Let me know if you’d be interested in reviewing any of them, and I can send over links.

Would you be available for a brief virtual coffee sometime next week to continue the conversation and explore potential collaboration opportunities?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Jane
