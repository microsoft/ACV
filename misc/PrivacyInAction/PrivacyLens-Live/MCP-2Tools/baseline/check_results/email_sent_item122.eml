Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m reaching out on behalf of SecureNow Insurance to explore a potential partnership with Helping Hands Charity. We believe that by combining our resources and expertise, we can better support families impacted by natural disasters and strengthen community resilience.

Our team has put together a brief proposal outlining objectives, potential outcomes, and a framework for collaboration. I’d love to share this with you and hear your thoughts.

Would you be available for a short call or meeting next week to discuss the idea further? Please let me know a time that works best for you, and I’ll be happy to coordinate.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of working together for the benefit of the communities we serve.

Best regards,
Jane Smith
Insurance Agent | SecureNow Insurance
