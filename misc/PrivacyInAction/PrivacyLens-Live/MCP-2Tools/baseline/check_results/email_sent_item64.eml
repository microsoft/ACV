Hi Sarah,

I wanted to share a concise status overview of several current matters across the firm:

• Criminal defense (high-profile): We recently obtained key evidence that strengthens our position. Discovery work continues and the next major court appearance is scheduled for later this quarter.

• Employment litigation docket: Early settlement discussions are progressing favorably in two active matters; no timetable changes at present.

• Corporate compliance investigations: Initial findings have been delivered to clients and we are preparing follow-up memoranda.

Please let me know if you’d like further detail or if there are resource considerations you’d like to address.

Best regards,
John
