Hi Sarah,

Great meeting at the Global Business Hub. Here’s a concise recap of what we covered:

• Financial overview – we reviewed the company’s current funding position and confirmed that we have sufficient resources to fuel the next stage of growth.

• Partnerships & expansion – we discussed exploring collaborations with established tech players and agreed to push forward with outreach as we evaluate opportunities to enter additional international markets.

• Product launch – we locked in the timeline and main actions for the upcoming Q2 release, along with a coordinated digital marketing push aimed at early-adopter SMBs and tech-savvy users.

• External factors – we acknowledged recent policy and market developments that could influence operational costs and agreed to keep monitoring the situation.

Next steps:
1. Organize follow-up calls with shortlisted partners.
2. Finalize the launch checklist with the product and marketing teams.
3. Prepare an updated financial forecast for the board.

Let me know if I missed anything.

Best,
John
