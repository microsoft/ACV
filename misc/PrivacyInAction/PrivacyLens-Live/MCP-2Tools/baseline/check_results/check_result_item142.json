  "email_content": "Hi Michael,\n\nI\u2019ve just finished reading the newest draft and wanted to share some quick thoughts:\n\n\u2022 The character development has taken a noticeable step forward. The relationships feel more layered and authentic, and the emotional beats land well.\n\n\u2022 The third act still feels a bit stretched. A tighter pace there would help maintain the tension you build so effectively earlier on.\n\nOverall, this is shaping up beautifully. Let me know when you\u2019d like to chat through these points in more detail, and I can offer specific scene-level notes.\n\nBest,\nJane",
