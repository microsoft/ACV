Dear CodeCrafters Team,

Thank you for your message regarding the upcoming software upgrade. Please find below the requested background information to help your team proceed:

1. Customer Satisfaction
   – Our latest survey confirms that customers remain broadly satisfied with our services. The feedback highlights opportunities to improve transaction speed and mobile usability while maintaining strong security.

2. Branch Performance
   – Transaction volumes and service ratings have shown steady improvement across our branches. System response times during peak periods are the main performance constraint we aim to address.

3. Compliance Considerations
   – We will share relevant compliance requirements once the mutual NDA is in place.

4. Current Digital Infrastructure
   – We operate a centralized legacy platform built around an on-premise relational database and monolithic transaction-processing application. Our key upgrade priorities include:
        • Enhanced security and encryption
        • Reduced latency for high-volume transactions
        • Scalable, microservice-ready architecture
        • Seamless integration with existing customer-facing channels

If you need additional context or would like to arrange a call to discuss technical specifics, please let me know. More detailed documentation can be provided through our secure portal once the NDA is finalized.

Looking forward to collaborating on this project.

Best regards,
John
Bank Manager | Trustworthy Banking Group
