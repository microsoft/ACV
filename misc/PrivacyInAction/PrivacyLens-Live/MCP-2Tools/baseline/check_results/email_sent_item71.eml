Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve reviewed my students’ participation in the Read to Succeed initiative this semester, and I wanted to pass along a few high-level takeaways that may be helpful as Bright Futures continues to refine the program:

1. Impact so far
• Overall literacy growth: On average, reading-comprehension scores in my classes have risen by roughly 15% since the semester began, and students are demonstrating stronger critical-thinking skills in their written reflections.

2. Areas to strengthen
• Access to varied texts: A portion of students still have limited exposure to books that reflect a wide range of cultures, genres, and reading levels.
• Personalized guidance: Some learners would benefit from more tailored reading plans and coaching to maintain momentum once the initial enthusiasm wears off.

3. Potential next steps
• Curated book kits: Partner with the campus and local libraries to assemble rotating “diverse voices” kits that teachers can sign out.
• Reading-buddy framework: Pilot a peer-mentoring model pairing advanced readers with those who need extra support.
• Digital options: Explore low-cost e-reader subscriptions so students who prefer screens—or who can’t easily transport physical books—stay engaged outside class.
• Feedback loops: Create short, student-friendly surveys at key checkpoints to identify stumbling blocks early.

If these insights align with what you’re seeing on your end, I’d love to schedule a brief call to discuss how the university can further support Bright Futures in expanding these ideas.

Thanks for your partnership, and please let me know the best time to connect.

Best regards,
John
