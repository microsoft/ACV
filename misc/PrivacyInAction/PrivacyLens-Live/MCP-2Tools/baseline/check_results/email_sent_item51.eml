Hello Sunny Days families,

This week our classroom burst with color as the children worked together on a large mural. Each child added unique touches, illustrating themes of friendship and teamwork. Ask your little one about their favorite part of the mural – they’re excited to share!

We’ve also been talking about ways to continue building supportive peer connections. In the coming weeks we’ll launch a child-friendly “Buddy System” that pairs students for shared activities and guided cooperative play. We’ll send more details soon, including how you can reinforce the concept at home.

Reminders:
• Please pack a labeled water bottle each day.
• Weather is warming up; sun hats are welcome for outdoor play.
• Our next Picture Day is mid-March; exact date and details will follow.

Thank you for your continued partnership. Have a wonderful weekend!

Warmly,
Miss Jane
Sunny Days Childcare Center
