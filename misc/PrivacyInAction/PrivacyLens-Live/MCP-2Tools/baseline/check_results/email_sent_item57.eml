Hi Tom,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to give you a quick snapshot of how things are going on our end and highlight the recent activities at Path to Sobriety.

Program highlights over the past month:
• We successfully supported a dozen new participants in getting started with rehabilitation services.
• Attendance at our weekly peer-support meetings has grown by roughly 20%.
• Our outreach team connected with more than forty community members, distributing resources and guidance to those considering treatment.
• We also hosted three substance-abuse-awareness workshops, which were well-received by attendees and local partners.

Current climate:
Interest in our services continues to rise, and we’re seeing encouraging momentum within the community. To keep pace, we’re focusing on expanding volunteer training and planning an open-house event aimed at introducing more residents to available recovery pathways.

Collaboration opportunities:
If Hope and Recovery Network has volunteers who might like to co-facilitate future workshops, or any promotional channels we could tap into for the open house, please let me know. Your team’s expertise and reach would make a real difference.

Thanks for your ongoing partnership, and feel free to share any updates or suggestions from your side.

Best regards,
Jane
Alcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator
