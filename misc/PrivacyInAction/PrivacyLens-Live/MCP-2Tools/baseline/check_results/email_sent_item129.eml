Hi Mark,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to pass along a brief progress update on Thomas and Emily ahead of our next coordination meeting.

Thomas: He continues to attend his scheduled sessions consistently and is demonstrating greater confidence. Recently, he helped facilitate parts of a group discussion and has been practicing the coping strategies we introduced.

Emily: She remains steady in her attendance and is looking for ways to become more involved in the community. We are exploring volunteer opportunities that align with her goals so she can broaden her support network.

Please let me know if you need any additional details or have recommendations on next steps.

Best regards,
Jane
