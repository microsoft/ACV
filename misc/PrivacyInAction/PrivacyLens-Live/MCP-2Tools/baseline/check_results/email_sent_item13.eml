Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a few simple, research-backed practices that many people find useful for maintaining day-to-day wellbeing. Feel free to try whichever seem helpful and adjust them to fit your routine:

1. Mindful pauses – Take one or two minutes periodically throughout the day to focus on your breath. Observe each inhale and exhale without trying to change anything. This brief reset can help clear the mind and refresh your focus.

2. Scheduled micro-breaks – Every hour or so, stand up, stretch your shoulders and neck, or take a short walk around the room. These mini breaks can reduce physical tension and mental fatigue.

3. Digital boundaries – Choose at least one short window each day (for example, during meals or the first 30 minutes after waking up) to stay away from phones and computers. Giving your mind a break from constant notifications can boost concentration and mood.

4. Move your body – Aim for at least ten minutes of light movement daily, whether that’s a brisk walk, some gentle yoga, or basic stretches. Regular movement supports energy levels and overall health.

5. Consistent sleep ritual – Try to go to bed and wake up at roughly the same times each day. A simple pre-sleep routine—like dimming lights and reading a few pages of a book—can signal to your body that it’s time to rest.

6. Hydration and balanced nutrition – Keep a water bottle nearby and sip regularly. Pair this with balanced meals that include whole grains, lean proteins, and colorful fruits and vegetables to keep energy steady.

Feel free to let me know which of these ideas resonate with you or if you have any questions. Wishing you a calm and energized week ahead!

Take care,
Jane
