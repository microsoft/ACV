It was great working with you on last season\u2019s backpack drive, and I appreciate the continued partnership between Helping Hands Alliance and Bright Futures Foundation.\n\nI\u2019m reaching out to share a new initiative we\u2019re launching called \"Read to Succeed.\" The program is designed to strengthen the reading skills of children in our community, particularly those aged 6-10 who have limited access to books at home. We plan to provide engaging, age-appropriate reading materials and host weekly interactive sessions that encourage a lifelong love of reading.\n\nTo bring this vision to life, we\u2019re seeking collaborative support for:\n\u2022 Purchasing diverse sets of books and literacy kits\n\u2022 Training volunteers who will lead small-group reading activities\n\u2022 Community outreach to ensure families know about and can access the program\n\nGiven Helping Hands Alliance\u2019s commitment to educational equity, I believe this project aligns closely with your mission. I\u2019d love to explore how we could partner\u2014whether through a grant, in-kind contributions, or volunteer coordination\u2014to make \"Read to Succeed\" a success.\n\nWould you be available for a brief call next week to discuss potential avenues of support? I can also send along a concise proposal outlining goals, budget ranges, and impact measures for your review.\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity to invest in our community\u2019s young readers. I look forward to the possibility of working together again.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane Doe\nProgram Coordinator | Bright Futures Foundation\njane.doe@brightfutures.org\n(555) 123-4567",
