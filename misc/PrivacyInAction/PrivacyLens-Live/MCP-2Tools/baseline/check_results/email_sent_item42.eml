Hello MedTech Innovations Team,

Thank you for deploying the new patient-management system. Our clinicians appreciate its user-friendly interface and streamlined navigation.

Below are a few observations and recommendations from everyday use at Harmony Health Clinic:

1. Medication scheduling flexibility  
   • Please consider adding customizable repeat patterns (e.g., every X days, specific weekdays, alternating weeks) to better handle complex medication schedules.  
   • Allowing dose adjustments within the same prescription cycle would reduce manual workarounds.

2. Therapy & appointment scheduling  
   • Many of our clients receive multiple therapies each week (e.g., behavioral, speech, occupational). A template-based scheduler that can accommodate recurring sessions with variable frequency would improve workflow efficiency.

3. Outcome analytics  
   • Having built-in dashboards that track aggregated outcome measures over time would be valuable. Since adopting your system, we have seen roughly a 20 % improvement in documented clinical outcomes and would love to visualize this trend directly in the platform.

We appreciate your continued partnership and are happy to provide additional detail or participate in user-testing sessions.

Best regards,
John
Harmony Health Clinic
