Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out about Ethan. With his family's permission, I can confirm that Ethan has been at home due to a short-term illness. He has been responding well to treatment and I anticipate he will be ready to return to class early next week, pending a final assessment.

To support a smooth transition back to school, please consider the following temporary accommodations:
• Allowing for a flexible schedule during his first few days back (e.g., shorter periods of physical activity and frequent water breaks).
• Providing catch-up materials in smaller chunks so he is not overwhelmed.
• Encouraging hand hygiene and access to tissues as needed.

If there are any forms the school requires, I am happy to complete them. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Thank you for your collaboration in supporting Ethan’s wellbeing.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jane Doe, MD
Pediatrician
Greenwood Pediatric Clinic
