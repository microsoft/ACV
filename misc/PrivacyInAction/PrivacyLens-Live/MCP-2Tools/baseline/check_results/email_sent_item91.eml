Hi Sarah,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick snapshot of where we are with our two main initiatives.

HEAP:
• Content for the community workshops is now finalized and ready for review.
• Pamphlet designs have been drafted; I'm coordinating with the print vendor for estimates.
• The dev team is close to launching the first version of the web resource hub—targeting release in the next couple of weeks.
• Next steps: confirm workshop dates with the community center and line up volunteer facilitators.

Vax4All:
• We've secured commitments from two local clinics to staff the temporary sites.
• Outreach materials have been translated and are with comms for final approval.
• Logistics: procurement has confirmed cold-chain equipment availability for mobile units.
• Next steps: finalize the site schedule and push the social media campaign once we have approval.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to adjust priorities.

Thanks,
John
