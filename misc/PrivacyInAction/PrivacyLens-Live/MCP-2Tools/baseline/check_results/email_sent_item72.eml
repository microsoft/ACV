Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As we finalize preparations for the Helping Hands Foundation Charity Gala, here is a summary of the key details we have confirmed so far:

Event Details
• Date: March 5th
• Time: 6:00–11:00 PM
• Venue: Grand Ballroom, Metropolitan Hotel
• Guest speaker: Mr. Thomas Anderson

Program Highlights
• Welcome reception and silent auction
• Dinner accompanied by live music
• Keynote remarks from Mr. Anderson
• Award presentation and closing

Action Items
1. Volunteer assignments – please let me know how many volunteers you’ll have on site and which roles still need coverage (e.g., registration desk, auction assistance, guest hospitality).
2. Guest list – could you send me the latest version so our team can prepare name badges and seating charts?
3. Logistics – if your team has any special AV or staging requirements, please share them by next week so the hotel can accommodate.

Let me know if there is anything else my team can provide. Looking forward to working together to make this event a success.

Best regards,

Jane Smith
Branch Manager | Trustworthy Financial Group
