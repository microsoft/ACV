  "email_content": "Dear Oakwood Owlet Parents,\n\nI hope you are all doing well. I\u2019m excited to share that our class will soon begin a collaborative group project that will span the next few weeks. To help the students succeed, I\u2019d like to coordinate with you on materials, volunteer support, and general timelines.\n\nOverview:\n\u2022 Theme: Exploring local ecosystems (science focus with art and writing components)\n\u2022 Student tasks: research, create visual display, present findings to peers\n\nProposed support from home:\n1. Materials: simple recyclables (shoe boxes, paper towel rolls, magazines, etc.). If you have extras to donate, please send them in with your child by early next month.\n2. Volunteer assistance: If you are available to help supervise small groups during one of our in-class work sessions, please reply with your preferred date(s) and time(s).\n3. Practice presentations: Encourage your child to rehearse their explanation at home once drafts are complete.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 I will share a sign-up sheet for volunteer slots and material donations later this week.\n\u2022 Our class presentation will take place toward the middle of next month; exact day will follow once confirmed with the school calendar.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Your partnership is invaluable, and I appreciate everything you do to support our young learners.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane (Ms. Doe)\nOakwood Owlets \u00ad\u2013 Oakwood Elementary",
