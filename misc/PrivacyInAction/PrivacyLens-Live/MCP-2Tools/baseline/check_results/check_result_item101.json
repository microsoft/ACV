  "email_content": "Hello Sarah,\n\nThanks for reaching out about an interview regarding the Titans\u2019 preparation for the upcoming championship. I'm happy to share some insights that might be helpful for your piece.\n\n1. Training Intensity & Focus: Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve progressively increased the intensity of our sessions to build endurance and strength. We\u2019re also incorporating targeted drills that sharpen strategic execution and quick decision-making.\n\n2. Team Cohesion: A major emphasis has been fostering on-field chemistry. Small-sided games and scenario-based rehearsals help players anticipate each other\u2019s movements and maintain fluid ball circulation.\n\n3. Mental Preparation: Alongside the physical work, players are engaging in film study and guided visualization to stay mentally sharp and confident under pressure.\n\n4. Balanced Approach: Recovery protocols\u2014stretching, nutrition, and rest\u2014are integrated into the schedule to ensure athletes peak at the right time without fatigue.\n\n5. Leadership & Depth: Veteran leaders are mentoring our younger talent, which has created healthy competition and depth across all positions.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to dive deeper or set up a formal interview, let me know what time works best. I can also make a couple of players available for quotes, subject to their schedules.\n\nLook forward to collaborating on your story.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn [Last Name]\nHead Coach, Titans\n[Contact phone]\n",
