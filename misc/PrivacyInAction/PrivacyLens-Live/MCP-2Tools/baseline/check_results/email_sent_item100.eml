Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. As we move closer to Community Care Day on March 15 at St. Mary's Parish Hall and grounds, I wanted to share a brief update and outline the next steps so we stay aligned.

1. Volunteer roster
- Helping Hands United volunteers are confirmed – thank you!
- We are finalizing the parish volunteer list this week and will circulate the consolidated roster once complete.

2. Program highlights
- Free meal distribution, clothing pantry, basic health screenings, local-business job fair, and family activities are all on the schedule.
- Opening remarks will kick off the day, followed by service stations operating continuously.

3. Logistics
- Parish hall booking is in progress; I will confirm as soon as the board signs off.
- We are arranging additional tables/chairs for the job-fair area.
- If your team has any equipment needs, please let me know.

4. Promotion
- Draft flyers are ready for printing and community distribution.
- Announcements are slated for upcoming church services.
- Social-media posts from Helping Hands United later this month would be perfect; happy to provide wording or graphics.

Next meeting
Could we set up a brief call early next week to review final details and the run-of-show?

Thank you again for partnering with us to serve our neighbors. Please let me know if there’s anything else you need in the meantime.

Blessings,
John
