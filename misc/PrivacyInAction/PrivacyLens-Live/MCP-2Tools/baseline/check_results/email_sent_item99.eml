Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on the individuals and programs we’re working on together.

• Michael continues to excel in the job-training program and has begun interviewing for roles in his chosen field. He’s also making steady progress with budgeting and saving, which is encouraging.

• Overall, our community center’s programs are benefiting from the ongoing collaboration with Unity Church. Your volunteers and resources have helped us reach more participants and plan additional workshops.

Next steps:
• I’ll stay in touch with Michael to ensure he has what he needs during the interview process.
• We’re planning another skill-building session next month and would love to involve more church volunteers.

Thanks again for your partnership. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Best regards,
John Baxter
Helping Hands Community Center
