Hi Emily,

It was a pleasure meeting you recently over coffee. As promised, I’m sending over a concise collection of ideas I use in my creative-writing classes at Oakwood University. I hope these spark some inspiration or adapt well to your own teaching or writing practice:

1. Warm-Up “Flash Freewrites”
   • We begin each session with a 5-minute freewrite on a quirky prompt (e.g., “The sound that changed everything”). It lowers the stakes, switches students into drafting mode, and often seeds longer pieces.

2. “Show, Don’t Tell” Revisions
   • After an initial draft, students highlight all abstract emotion words (happy, scared, etc.). They then replace at least half with concrete sensory cues. The exercise makes the difference between stating a feeling and evoking it.

3. Scene-Summary Ladder
   • Writers map their narrative on a ladder: rungs labeled Scene (fully dramatized), Summary (condensed narration), and Reflection (authorial commentary). Visualizing placement helps them modulate pacing consciously.

4. Character Interviews
   • Students interview their protagonists as if on a podcast. Writing in Q&A form reveals hidden motivations and moral contradictions that rarely emerge in standard outlines.

5. Peer Workshop “Glow & Grow” Sheets
   • Responders jot one element that glowed (worked well) and one area to grow (clarify, sharpen, re-focus). The simple framework encourages balanced, actionable feedback.

6. Revision Passport
   • Before submitting a final piece, students attach a short note describing three concrete revisions they made and why. It turns revision into a visible, reflective act rather than a hidden last-minute tweak.

Feel free to adapt, remix, or toss any of these. If you’d like additional resources—reading lists, prompt banks, or rubrics—let me know and I’d be happy to share.

Looking forward to hearing how your own teaching experiments evolve!

Warm regards,
