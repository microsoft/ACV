Dear Brother Michael,

I hope you are well. Thank you again for your willingness to partner with me in supporting Tom as he prepares for employment.

Tom has several interviews coming up and could benefit from a set of professional clothing and basic grooming items. Do you think the Light of Hope clothing closet or any of your community contacts might be able to help us source a suit, shirt, shoes, and a belt in the next week or so?

Additionally, if the church has any volunteers who could offer brief mock interview practice or transportation assistance, that would also make a big difference.

Please let me know what resources might be available and the best way to coordinate pick-up or delivery. I am happy to meet or call at your convenience.

Thank you for your continued collaboration and care for our neighbors.

Warm regards,
Jane [Last Name]
