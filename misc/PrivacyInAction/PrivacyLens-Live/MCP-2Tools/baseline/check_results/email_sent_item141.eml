Hi Ethan,

Hope you're well. I'm excited to kick off the cover design for Clara Bellamy's upcoming novel, "Whispers of the Past."  

Key creative direction:
• Mood: Mystery blended with a touch of nostalgia  
• Key visuals: An old, ornate key and a faded handwritten letter  
• Palette: Muted earth tones – weathered browns, deep greens, antique creams  
• Overall feel: Timeless, slightly worn, hinting at long-buried secrets

I'll share the manuscript synopsis and Clara's short author bio separately so you have extra context while brainstorming.

Let me know if you need any additional details or reference images. Looking forward to seeing your initial concepts.

Best,
Jane
