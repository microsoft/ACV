  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Below is a summary of several recent customer-behavior trends at First Trust Bank that should help shape the campaign. All figures are aggregated across our retail portfolio for the last twelve months.\n\n1. Digital-first momentum\n   \u2022 Roughly two-thirds of all new personal accounts are opened through our mobile or web platforms.\n   \u2022 The strongest uptake is among customers aged 25\u201334, who are 1.4\u00d7 more likely than the overall average to choose a fully digital onboarding path.\n\n2. Mobile app engagement drivers \n   \u2022 Push notifications that reference real-time balance updates or upcoming payment dates lift in-app session frequency by about 20 %. \n   \u2022 Customers who enable card-control features (lock/unlock, spending limits) show a 15 % lower attrition rate after six months.\n\n3. Branch value proposition\n   \u2022 While digital usage is high, customers aged 55 + still cite in-person guidance as a top reason for staying with the bank. Education-focused clinics on retirement planning consistently attract strong attendance.\n\n4. Small-business segment\n   \u2022 The most requested products are flexible credit lines and instant-settlement merchant services. Featuring fast funding in ad copy has improved click-through rates for this group in recent pilots.\n\n5. Community and trust cues\n   \u2022 Messaging that highlights local sponsorships or financial-education workshops scores 18 % higher on brand-trust perception surveys across all age groups.\n\nCampaign considerations\n\u2022 Lead with the convenience and security of the mobile app for younger audiences (25\u201344). Emphasize card-control features and real-time alerts.\n\u2022 For 55 + customers, pair any digital call-to-action with an invitation to speak to a banker or attend an in-branch clinic.\n\u2022 Spotlight rapid funding and tailored support in creative aimed at small-business owners.\n\u2022 Thread community-impact stories throughout all placements to reinforce trust.\n\nI\u2019m happy to dig deeper into any of these areas or provide additional data cuts\u2014just let me know what would be most useful.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the creative concepts.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nFirst Trust Bank",
