  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out and for taking the initiative to familiarize yourself with our processes. Below is a concise overview of the key procedures you asked about, along with pointers to resources that will help you dive deeper.\n\nHandling customer inquiries\n1. Verify identity \u2013 Ask for acceptable photo ID and at least two account-related details before discussing any information.\n2. Listen and clarify \u2013 Restate the customer\u2019s request to confirm you\u2019ve captured it correctly.\n3. Resolve when possible \u2013 Use the Teller system workflows for routine transactions such as balance inquiries, deposits/withdrawals, transfers, and statement requests.\n4. Record the interaction \u2013 Enter clear, concise notes in the Teller system before closing the transaction.\n5. Escalate appropriately \u2013 If the request is outside your authority, involves a system error, or raises a compliance concern, open a ticket with the Help Desk (internal-help@trustwellbank.com) and notify me if the matter is time-sensitive.\n\nIssue-reporting protocol\n\u2022 Open a Help Desk ticket from your dashboard or by email. Include a brief description, transaction number, and the last 4 digits of the customer\u2019s account.  \n\u2022 Select the correct priority level (Routine, Urgent, or Critical).  \n\u2022 For Critical items (system outages, suspected fraud, etc.), contact me or the acting supervisor immediately after logging the ticket so we can follow up with the appropriate teams.\n\nAdditional resources\n\u2022 Notion \u2013 \u201cBank Procedures Overview\u201d page: step-by-step guides and decision trees.  \n\u2022 Quick Reference Guide in the branch binder (behind Teller Station 1).  \n\u2022 Teams channel \u201cBranch Support\u201d \u2013 real-time answers from senior tellers.\n\nPlease let me know if any part of the process is unclear or if you\u2019d like a walkthrough on the system screens.
