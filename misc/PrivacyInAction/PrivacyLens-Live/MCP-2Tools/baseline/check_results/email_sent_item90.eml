Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m excited about our collaboration to expand counseling services. Here are the immediate next steps we’re working on at St. Mary’s:

• Finalizing a list of volunteers who will take part in the program. We expect to have this ready within the next couple of weeks.

• Creating a draft schedule for the volunteer training sessions, which will focus on active listening skills and referral protocols.

Could you let me know if Helping Hands has any preferred training materials or documentation we should integrate? Additionally, please share any logistical details (room availability, virtual platform preferences, etc.) on your end so we can align our timelines.

Looking forward to making meaningful progress together. Thank you for your partnership.

Warm regards,
Jane
