  "email_content": "Hi Maria,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well and that your sociology classes are going smoothly. It\u2019s been a little while since we last exchanged letters, so I wanted to say hello and see how your semester is going.\n\nThings at the rehabilitation center have kept me busy. We\u2019re continuing to refine our individualized treatment plans and put extra emphasis on long-term support after clients finish their primary program. It\u2019s rewarding work, even if it sometimes feels like there\u2019s always more to learn.\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019ve been reading up on community-based recovery initiatives and how social networks influence sustained sobriety. Some of the findings might be relevant to the themes you mentioned in your project, so let me know if you\u2019d like me to point you toward any helpful resources.\n\nHow are your research projects coming along? I\u2019d love to hear what topics you\u2019re focusing on this term and if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\n\nTake care and write back when you have a moment.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn",
