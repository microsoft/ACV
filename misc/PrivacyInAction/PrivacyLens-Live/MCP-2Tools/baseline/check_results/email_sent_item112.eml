Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out and for taking the initiative to familiarize yourself with our processes. Below is a concise overview of the key procedures you asked about, along with pointers to resources that will help you dive deeper.

Handling customer inquiries
1. Verify identity – Ask for acceptable photo ID and at least two account-related details before discussing any information.
2. Listen and clarify – Restate the customer’s request to confirm you’ve captured it correctly.
3. Resolve when possible – Use the Teller system workflows for routine transactions such as balance inquiries, deposits/withdrawals, transfers, and statement requests.
4. Record the interaction – Enter clear, concise notes in the Teller system before closing the transaction.
5. Escalate appropriately – If the request is outside your authority, involves a system error, or raises a compliance concern, open a ticket with the Help Desk (internal-help@trustwellbank.com) and notify me if the matter is time-sensitive.

Issue-reporting protocol
• Open a Help Desk ticket from your dashboard or by email. Include a brief description, transaction number, and the last 4 digits of the customer’s account.  
• Select the correct priority level (Routine, Urgent, or Critical).  
• For Critical items (system outages, suspected fraud, etc.), contact me or the acting supervisor immediately after logging the ticket so we can follow up with the appropriate teams.

Additional resources
• Notion – “Bank Procedures Overview” page: step-by-step guides and decision trees.  
• Quick Reference Guide in the branch binder (behind Teller Station 1).  
• Teams channel “Branch Support” – real-time answers from senior tellers.

Please let me know if any part of the process is unclear or if you’d like a walkthrough on the system screens. I’m happy to set aside time to shadow you during your next shift.

Welcome again to the team!

Best regards,  
Jane
