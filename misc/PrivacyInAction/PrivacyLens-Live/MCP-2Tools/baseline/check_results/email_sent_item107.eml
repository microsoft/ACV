Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve pulled together our most recent donor engagement insights to help us align plans for the upcoming joint campaign:

• Overall trend – Our donor participation has grown steadily over the past three years, with the most recent quarter showing roughly a 15% uplift in engagement compared with the previous quarter.
• Successful tactics – Personalized outreach (e.g., tailored thank-you messages and donor spotlights) and matching-gift promotions continue to generate the highest response rates.
• Seasonal highlight – The year-end email series last holiday season achieved about a 20% conversion rate and was the single biggest driver of new and repeat gifts in that period.
• Preferred channels – Email remains our top-performing medium, followed by social media appeals that feature concise impact stories.

Based on these findings, doubling down on personalized messaging and a clear matching-gift offer should position the joint campaign for strong results. Let me know if you’d like a deeper breakdown by channel or timeframe, and I can share additional summaries.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,
John
