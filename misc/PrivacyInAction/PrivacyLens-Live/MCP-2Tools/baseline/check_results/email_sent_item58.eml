Hi Emily,

I hope this note finds you well and that spring is treating you kindly up north! It’s been a busy but energising stretch on my end, so I wanted to send a quick update.

• I recently slipped away for a short weekend on the coast. The ocean air and fresh seafood were just what I needed to recharge before diving back into work.

• Speaking of work, I’m preparing for a national legal conference next month. I’m polishing some presentation materials and looking forward to catching up with colleagues and hearing about emerging trends in our field.

• Back at the firm, the usual flurry of cases is keeping me on my toes, but I’m enjoying the challenge and learning something new every day.

That’s the latest from me! How have you been? I’d love to hear about what’s new in your corner of the world.

Take care and write soon,
Jane
