Hi Alex,

It was nice meeting you at the networking event, and I appreciate your interest in the work we do at Serenity Path.

At a glance, here are some observations from our team’s experience:

• Approach: We pair evidence-based clinical therapies (cognitive-behavioral work, 12-Step facilitation, family-based interventions) with holistic supports such as vocational coaching, mindfulness training, and peer-led groups. Matching the level of care—inpatient, intensive outpatient, or community after-care—to each person’s needs is key.

• Outcomes: Over the past year roughly three out of four clients who complete a full treatment cycle report maintaining sobriety during follow-ups. We continuously monitor outcomes to refine programs.

• Success factors: Consistent peer support, involving family members early, and a clear post-discharge plan (housing, employment, relapse-prevention coaching) make the biggest difference.

• Ongoing challenges: Many clients arrive with co-occurring mental-health conditions or limited social supports. Stigma and gaps in community resources (especially affordable housing) can complicate recovery. Funding constraints also limit how long we can keep some clients in higher-intensity programs.

• Tech & data: We’re investing more in data-tracking tools to flag relapse risk early and in tele-health options for rural clients.

If any of these areas spark your curiosity, let me know. I’d be happy to set up a short call or give you a tour so you can see the programs in action.

Thanks again for reaching out, and best of luck with your projects.

Warm regards,
