Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance,

Thank you for sending the updated list of student accommodations and for highlighting the upcoming exam period. I have reviewed the document and appreciate the thoroughness.

Key points:
• The listed accommodations align with our current health and support plans.
• I have verified that medications, testing environments, and emergency procedures are ready.
• For Emily W. and other students requiring medical monitoring, I will brief the relevant staff on protocol and ensure supplies are on hand.
• If you become aware of any new students who may need support, please let me know so we can arrange screenings and plans well in advance.

Next steps:
1. I will share individualized accommodation summaries with the classroom teachers by early next week.
2. I will schedule brief check-ins with grade-level leads to clarify any questions.
3. Please feel free to reach out if any adjustments are needed.

Thank you for your collaboration in making our testing environment supportive for every student.

Best regards,

Jane
School Nurse, Oakwood Elementary
