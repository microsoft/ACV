Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well and that your sociology classes are going smoothly. It’s been a little while since we last exchanged letters, so I wanted to say hello and see how your semester is going.

Things at the rehabilitation center have kept me busy. We’re continuing to refine our individualized treatment plans and put extra emphasis on long-term support after clients finish their primary program. It’s rewarding work, even if it sometimes feels like there’s always more to learn.

Outside of work, I’ve been reading up on community-based recovery initiatives and how social networks influence sustained sobriety. Some of the findings might be relevant to the themes you mentioned in your project, so let me know if you’d like me to point you toward any helpful resources.

How are your research projects coming along? I’d love to hear what topics you’re focusing on this term and if there’s anything I can do to help.

Take care and write back when you have a moment.

Best wishes,
John
