Dear Team Leaders,

As requested, please find below a consolidated report that brings together our latest performance metrics (Q4-2021 snapshot) and the preliminary budget forecast for FY-2022. The information is drawn from the Performance Metrics & Insights deck circulated in January, the Annual Financial Report, and the HR Central work-spaces in Notion.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Performance Summary (Q4-2021)
--------------------------------------------------
Key Highlights
• Target Achievement – Overall team performance exceeded quarterly targets by 12 %, driven mainly by strong delivery on the Phoenix and Nimbus projects.
• Quality & Efficiency – Code-quality defects per 1,000 LOC fell by 8 % QoQ while average sprint velocity increased by 10 %.
• Customer Impact – NPS rose from 61 to 68 after the December feature release.
• Employee Engagement – The latest pulse survey shows a 9 % uplift in overall satisfaction (now 83 %) after launching the mentorship and development programmes.

Areas Requiring Attention
• Cross-departmental collaboration scores remain below the 80 % threshold (currently 72 %). A series of targeted workshops is planned for March to address this.
• On-call incident response times improved quarter-on-quarter but still trail the OKR target by ~6 minutes.

Action Items Already Underway
√ “Collab-Week” pilot scheduled for 14–18 March to deepen coordination between Product, Engineering and Marketing.
√ Retrospective templates have been standardised to capture root-cause data on incidents and accelerate learning loops.

2. Budget Overview – FY-2022 (Draft)
--------------------------------------------------
Totals & Allocation
• Engineering & Product Development    $2.5 M
  ↳ New hires (8 FTE)             $0.50 M
  ↳ Planned salary increments          $0.35 M
  ↳ Operational costs                  $1.65 M
• Digital Marketing                     $1.20 M
• Research & Innovation Fund            $1.80 M (continuation of 2021 strategic investments)
• G&A / Shared Services                 $0.95 M

Assumptions & Notes
• Revenue is projected to grow 11–13 % YoY, based on the sales pipeline converted so far.
• Inflationary pressure has been factored at 3.2 % across vendor contracts.
• The above figures leave a 5 % contingency ($0.33 M) un-allocated for emergent initiatives.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Recommendations & Next Steps
--------------------------------------------------
1. Approve the draft departmental budgets by 18 February so Finance can lock them into the ERP ahead of Q1 close.
2. Endorse the cross-department collaboration plan and nominate representatives for the March workshops.
3. Review the incident-response OKR and propose additional automation tooling if required (target: decision by 25 February).

I will be happy to walk the group through the supporting spreadsheets and Notion dashboards in our next leadership sync. Please let me know if you would like any additional cuts of the data or scenario modelling before then.

Thank you for your time and continued partnership.
