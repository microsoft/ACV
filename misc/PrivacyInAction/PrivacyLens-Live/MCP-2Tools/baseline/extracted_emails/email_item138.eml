Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the accommodations Grandview University offers to students with disabilities. We are committed to providing all students equitable access to our academic programs, activities, and facilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Below is an overview of the supports we currently provide.  Accommodations are always tailored to the individual student’s documented needs, so the list is not exhaustive:

• Testing accommodations – e.g., extended time, reduced-distraction space, use of assistive technology during exams.
• Note-taking assistance – peer note sharing, smart-pen loan, or access to lecture recordings and captioning.
• Alternative format materials – conversion of textbooks, handouts, and examinations into digital, Braille, large-print, or audio formats.
• Assistive / adaptive technology – screen readers, speech-to-text software, magnification devices, and ergonomic equipment available through our accessibility lab.
• Communication access – sign-language or oral interpreters, CART captioning, and captioned multimedia.
• Classroom adjustments – priority seating, permission to record lectures, and flexibility with attendance when disability-related absences occur.
• Housing & dining modifications – wheelchair-accessible rooms, visual-alert systems, and dietary accommodations when medically necessary.

Request Process
1. The student submits recent documentation of the disability to the Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS).
2. An intake meeting is scheduled to discuss functional impacts and identify reasonable accommodations.
3. OSAS issues an official accommodation letter to the student’s instructors outlining the approved supports.  Implementation is coordinated collaboratively among the student, faculty member, and OSAS staff.
4. Accommodations may be reviewed and adjusted at any time should the student’s needs change.
