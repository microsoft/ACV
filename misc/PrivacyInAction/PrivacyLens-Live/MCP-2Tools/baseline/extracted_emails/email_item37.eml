Hi Sarah,

Thanks for looping me in—I’m really looking forward to Quantum Cohesion 2023! I’ve been reviewing the latest culture-feedback summaries and our most recent 360° evaluations, and a few themes keep surfacing:
• The team is hungry for more creative problem-solving time outside day-to-day work.
• People value chances to collaborate with colleagues they rarely interact with.
• We could use structured but low-stakes forums to showcase innovative ideas.
• Well-being and balance remain a priority after an intense release cycle.

With those points in mind, here are some retreat activities that could hit the mark:

1. Innovation Hackathon (½-day)
   Small cross-functional pods tackle self-nominated “wish-list” ideas or pain-points. Each pod demos a prototype or concept at the end. Provides that creative space the team’s been asking for while generating real insights for the roadmap.

2. “Quantum Quest” Escape Game (90 min)
   A custom escape-room-style puzzle that we can set up in the hotel ballroom. Groups of 6 need to solve physics-themed clues; collaboration and communication are key, so it’s great for bonding.

3. Skill-Swap Lightning Talks (1 hr, post-lunch)
   Five-minute micro-talks where volunteers teach something they’re passionate about—anything from React tricks to latte art. Builds psychological safety and lets quieter voices shine.

4. Outdoor Challenge Course (2 hrs)
   Low-ropes and problem-solving stations. Physical enough to be energising but accessible to all fitness levels.

5. Mindful Morning + Gratitude Wall
   Start day two with a 15-minute guided mindfulness session, then keep a “wall” where teammates can post sticky-note shout-outs throughout the retreat. Addresses the well-being & recognition feedback.

Logistics/Next Steps
• Headcount: Do we have a current attendee estimate? That’ll help size the hackathon pods and game teams.
• Venue: If the main lodge has a divisible ballroom, it can double as the hackathon and escape-game space.
• Budget: I can reach out to a local team-building vendor for the ropes course/escape game once we have a rough budget range.
• Timing: My gut says a 2-day, 1-night format works best—hackathon day one, outdoor + reflection activities day two—but happy to adapt.

Let me know what resonates or if you’d like me to flesh out any of these further. I’m happy to own the hackathon agenda and help wrangle materials.

Looking forward to making this retreat memorable!

Best,
John
