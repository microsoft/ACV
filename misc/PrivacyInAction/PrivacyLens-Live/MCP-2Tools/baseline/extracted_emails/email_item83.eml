Hello TechSolutions Team,

Thank you for reaching out for more information about our hiring process. Below is a concise overview of the workflow we currently follow for student assistantship and other early-career roles.  While specific calendar dates vary from year to year, the milestones and decision-points remain consistent:

1. Role Definition & Posting
   • Hiring managers draft or refresh the job description and success profile.
   • HR posts the position on internal and external boards the same day the description is approved.

2. Application Intake (≈ 4–6 weeks)
   • All applications are collected through our ATS.  
   • Candidates receive an automatic acknowledgement email and a copy of our FAQ to set expectations.

3. Initial HR Screening (≈ 2 weeks after the deadline)
   • HR reviews every résumé for baseline requirements and culture add potential.
   • Qualified candidates are advanced to the hiring committee; others receive a courteous rejection note.

4. Structured Interviews (≈ 2–3 weeks)
   • Round 1: 30-minute video interviews focused on motivation, communication skills, and basic technical fit.
   • Round 2: 45- to 60-minute panel interview with the Academic Selection Panel and future teammates.  Candidates are asked to complete a short, job-relevant exercise that mirrors day-to-day work.
   • All interviewers use a standardized scoring rubric so that notes are easy to compare.
   • Interview scheduling is fully automated via the calendaring tool you helped us implement—thank you!

5. Deliberation & Decision (≈ 3–5 days)
   • The committee meets, reviews rubric scores and qualitative feedback, and ranks finalists.
   • We aim for consensus; if there is a tie, the hiring manager has final say.

6. Offer & Pre-boarding
   • Verbal offer calls are made within 48 hours of the decision, followed by an electronic offer letter.
   • Once accepted, candidates receive a welcome packet and are invited to select a preferred onboarding date.

7. Onboarding & Feedback Loop
   • Day 1 orientation covers IT, HR, and DEI training.
   • After 30 days, new hires complete a brief survey so we can continue to refine the process.
