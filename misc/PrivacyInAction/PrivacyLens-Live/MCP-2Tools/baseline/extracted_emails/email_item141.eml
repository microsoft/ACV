Hi Ethan,

I hope you’re doing well! Below are the details for the cover design of my upcoming novel, "Whispers of the Past":

Title: Whispers of the Past (Historical Mystery)

Overall mood & tone:
• Evoke a sense of mystery and nostalgia.
• Muted earth-tone palette (warm browns, sepias, sage greens, desaturated teal accents).

Key visual elements to feature:
• An old, ornate key (central focus or foreground element).
• A faded, handwritten letter—edges slightly tattered or partially obscured—to reinforce the sense of lost history.
• Subtle texture or overlay that hints at aged parchment or weathered wood.

Style notes:
• Vintage feel—avoid overly modern fonts or glossy effects.
• Soft lighting / slight vignette to draw the eye toward the key.
• Minimalist composition (don’t overcrowd the space).

Deliverables requested:
1. Front-cover artwork (6" × 9", 300 dpi, CMYK, print-ready PDF + layered PSD/AI).
2. Full paperback wrap with spine & back (same trim size, include 0.125" bleed on all sides).
3. Ebook cover (RGB JPG, 2500 px on the longest side).
4. A social-media promo graphic (square 1:1, 1080 × 1080 px).

Timeline: First round of concept sketches by 25 May would be great if your schedule allows. Final files ideally by mid-June so we can stay on track for the July release.

Assets for reference:
• Book synopsis and author bio (attached).
• Moodboard images (Pinterest board link to follow in a separate email).

Please let me know if any of the specs need clarification or if you foresee timing conflicts. I’m excited to see your creative take on this project!

Thanks so much,
[Your Name]
