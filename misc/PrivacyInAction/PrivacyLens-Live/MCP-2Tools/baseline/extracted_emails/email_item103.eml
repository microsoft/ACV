Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share a brief update on what our team has been working on lately and give you an early look at our upcoming charity event.

Recent Activities
• Completed a community needs assessment that helped us prioritize focus areas such as neighborhood clean-ups, youth mentoring, and food security.
• Recruited over 30 volunteers from the parish and surrounding community and held an orientation session last weekend.
• Launched a weekly after-school tutoring program that is already supporting 12 students.
• Partnered with our local grocery store to start a non-perishable food drive—our first pick-up brought in about 150 lbs of food.

Upcoming Charity Event – Mid-March (exact date/time TBC)
Theme: “Together for Our Community”
Format & Venue: Full-day event at a local parish hall and the adjacent park.
Main Activities:
  • Neighborhood clean-up and beautification projects
  • Free health-screening booth (with St. Mary’s Clinic)
  • Kids’ craft and activity corner
  • Donation drop-off station for food, clothing, and school supplies
Goals:
  • Mobilize at least 100 volunteers
  • Collect 500 lbs of food donations
  • Raise awareness for our ongoing service programs

How Helping Hands Can Get Involved
1. Co-host the volunteer registration/information table and help with day-of coordination.
2. Provide outreach materials or host an informational booth about your programs.
3. Share our event flyer across your networks to boost turnout.

We’ll circulate the finalized program and promotional materials next week, but I wanted to get this on your radar early in case you and your team would like to collaborate.

Thanks so much for your continued support. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
