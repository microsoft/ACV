Dear University of Excellence Alumni,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing with an exciting snapshot of the applicant pool for the incoming Class of 2029.

Key Numbers
• 5,000 completed applications – a 12% increase over last year
• Average SAT: 1420  |  Average ACT: 32
• Applicants represent 100+ countries and every U.S. state
• Most-requested majors: Computer Science, Business, Biology, International Relations

What Stands Out About This Cohort
• Commitment to service – more than 70% have held a community-service leadership role.
• Resilience – many applicants wrote compelling essays about overcoming significant challenges, showing remarkable grit and empathy.
• Global perspective – students hail from six continents, bringing diverse cultural viewpoints to campus.

Next Steps
Admissions committees are currently reviewing files. Early decision notifications will go out in December and regular decision notifications in March. Our campus and virtual interview programs are under way — thank you to the many alumni who volunteer as interviewers each year.

How You Can Help
• Continue volunteering for interviews (sign-up link)
• Share scholarship and financial-aid information with prospective students
• Join our admitted-students welcome events in the spring

Your dedication and enthusiasm mean a great deal to us and to the students who dream of joining our community. Thank you for helping us attract and support the next generation of Excellence scholars.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
Director of Undergraduate Admissions
