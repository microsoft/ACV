Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out and for all that Hope & Aid does for our community. I’ve gathered some recent observations and data points that highlight where the needs are greatest right now:

1. Food Security
   • Our parish food-bank initiative has experienced a 20 % rise in demand over the last quarter.
   • Most requested items: shelf-stable proteins (canned tuna, beans), baby formula, and toiletries.

2. Mental-Health Support
   • We’re receiving more requests for affordable counselling and peer-support groups, especially from teens and young adults who are struggling with anxiety and depression.

3. Addiction Recovery Resources
   • Several parishioners have shared ongoing battles with alcohol dependence. Families cite strained relationships and financial hardship as side-effects.
   • There’s strong interest in accessible, community-based recovery programmes and family-support workshops.

4. Economic Hardship Assistance
   • With the current economic downturn, many neighbours are facing job loss or reduced hours. Emergency relief for utilities and rent is becoming a pressing concern.

Priority Gaps Where Partnership Would Help Most
• Regular donations of high-need food items (see list above) and fresh produce vouchers.
• Funding for licensed mental-health professionals to run low-cost counselling sessions one evening a week.
• Training/volunteer support for addiction-recovery meetings hosted on site.
• Small emergency-fund grants for utilities/rent to prevent evictions.

If Hope & Aid has volunteers or resources that align with any of these areas, we’d love to coordinate. I’m happy to supply more detailed figures or set up a call to plan next steps.

Thanks again for connecting, and please let me know how I can support your efforts.

Warm regards,
