Dear TechMed Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. Following our recent exchanges about the upcoming dispatch software, I wanted to consolidate my thoughts on the functionality that would have the greatest impact for our field teams.

1. Reliable Real-Time Updates
   • Instant status changes for units, calls, and tasks—even during peak traffic periods.
   • Live GPS tracking with sub-minute refresh rates.

2. Robust Mobile Experience
   • Fully featured iOS/Android app that mirrors the desktop workflow.
   • Offline mode with automatic data sync once a connection is re-established.

3. Customizable Dashboards & Reporting
   • Drag-and-drop widgets so supervisors can monitor KPIs that matter to them.
   • Ad-hoc report builder with export to CSV/PDF.

4. Seamless Data Integrations
   • Two-way API connectivity to our CRM, inventory, and ePCR systems.
   • Automated import of CAD data to reduce double-entry.

5. Quick-Access Medical Equipment Database
   • One-tap lookup of equipment availability and location while en route.
   • Low-bandwidth design so it loads quickly in the field.

6. Protocol & Reference Updates in Real Time
   • Push notifications when clinical guidelines change.
   • Version control so crews always see the current protocol.

7. Enhanced Patient Data Handling
   • Secure intake of pre-arrival information with HIPAA-compliant encryption.
   • Role-based permissions to limit PHI visibility to authorized staff only.

8. Smart Alerts & Notifications
   • Configurable triggers for overdue status changes, resource shortages, or route deviations.
   • SMS/email escalation paths for critical events.

These capabilities would streamline our workflow, improve communication, and ultimately help us deliver faster, safer care.

Please let me know if you’d like additional detail on any of the items above or if a brief call would be helpful. I’m happy to collaborate further to ensure the final product aligns with frontline needs.

Thank you for your continued partnership.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Operations Manager
