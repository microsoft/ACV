Dear Dr. Strauss,

Thank you for your patience while I finalized the summary statistics. Below is the aggregated prevalence data for the population that I counsel, formatted as comma-separated values (CSV) per our previous discussion:

Marker,Prevalence_Percentage,Sample_Size
BRCA1,5,215
MTHFR (rare functional variant),0.5,215

Key notes:
• The figures are calculated from a fully de-identified dataset of 215 individuals seen in counselling sessions between January 2021 – January 2022.
• Percentages are rounded to the nearest 0.1 %; counts have been converted to percentages only, in order to maintain participant anonymity.
• No individual-level genomic sequences or personally identifiable information are included.

If you need the file as an attachment, a different delimiter, or any additional markers, just let me know and I will be happy to provide it quickly.

Please confirm that this format meets your requirements, or advise if further adjustments are necessary.

Best regards,

Jane Doe, MS, CGC
Genetic Counselor
