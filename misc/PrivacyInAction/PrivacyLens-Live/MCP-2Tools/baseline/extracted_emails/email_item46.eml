Hello Rainbow Fertility Care Team,

My name is Jordan Taylor and my partner, Alex Martinez, and I would like to schedule an initial fertility consultation with your clinic. We are a lesbian couple excited to start our family and were drawn to Rainbow Fertility Care because of your inclusive approach and strong track-record helping LGBT couples.

Preferred consultation windows (weekdays):
•  Monday 18 March – Wednesday 20 March 2025
•  Monday 7 April – Thursday 10 April 2025
If none of these dates are available, please let us know alternative openings and we will do our best to accommodate.

Background information that may be helpful ahead of the appointment:
•  Ages: Jordan – 32, Alex – 31
•  General health: Both non-smokers with no chronic medical conditions.
•  Family history: Alex has a strong family history of twins (maternal side).
•  Current medications/supplements: standard daily multivitamin for both; no prescription medications.

Questions we hope to discuss during the consultation:
•  Success rates for IUI versus IVF for lesbian couples.
•  Legal considerations surrounding donor sperm, parentage and birth certificates in New York.
•  Recommended lifestyle or dietary adjustments prior to treatment.
•  Any ways our family history of twins could influence treatment planning.

Please let us know:
1.  Which of the proposed dates you can accommodate.
2.  Any forms, medical records or additional information you would like us to provide in advance.
3.  Whether the consultation can be conducted via video or if an in-person visit is preferred.

You can reach me at this email address or on my cell (646-555-0198) if you require any further details.

Thank you for your time and we look forward to working with you.

Warm regards,
Jordan Taylor & Alex Martinez
