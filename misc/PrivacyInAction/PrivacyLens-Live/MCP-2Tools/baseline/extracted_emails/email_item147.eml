Hi Tom,

It was great to connect recently. Below is a concise overview of strategies we’ve found effective at Westbrook University and with partner organizations when working with refugee students. I hope these ideas are useful as HopeBridge Foundation expands its education initiatives.

1. Targeted language support
   • Stand-alone ESL courses that focus on academic English.
   • Conversation clubs facilitated by volunteers to build confidence.
   • Allow students to audit mainstream classes alongside ESL to accelerate immersion.

2. Mentorship & Advising
   • Pair each student with a faculty/staff mentor for academic guidance and welfare check-ins.
   • Train mentors on trauma-informed advising and cultural sensitivity.
   • Create a peer-to-peer “buddy” system for everyday campus navigation.

3. Community & Belonging
   • Host intercultural events that let refugee students showcase their culture.
   • Encourage involvement in service-learning projects so students can give back, reinforcing self-efficacy.
   • Provide dedicated common spaces (physical or virtual) where students can gather and support each other.

4. Holistic integration supports
   • Offer tailored orientation sessions covering healthcare, banking, and transportation.
   • Collaborate with local NGOs for pro-bono legal and counseling services.
   • Build an emergency micro-grant fund to ease unexpected financial pressures.

5. Continuous monitoring & feedback
   • Schedule brief monthly check-ins to track academic progress and well-being.
   • Use anonymous pulse surveys to surface barriers early.
   • Involve students in program design through advisory councils.

Key success factors we’ve observed:
   • Flexibility – programs that can adapt to varied language levels and prior schooling histories.
   • Trauma-aware approach – staff training on the effects of displacement improves retention.
   • Visible institutional commitment – when leadership publicly champions inclusion, other students follow suit.

If it would help, I’m happy to share program templates or put you in touch with colleagues running our ESL modules.

Let me know your thoughts or any specific areas where you’d like deeper detail.
