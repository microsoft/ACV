Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on how our revised curriculum is performing this semester.

Key highlights
• Overall student grades have risen by 12% compared with last semester.
• Students repeatedly cited the real-world case studies and hands-on projects as making challenging concepts easier to grasp.
• We saw marked gains in critical-thinking and application-based assessments. For example, Aaliyah Green improved to an A after showing exceptional growth in applying concepts to practical scenarios.
• Feedback also notes that some of the advanced statistics and theory modules still feel steep; learners would welcome more guidance and review opportunities.

Planned next steps
1. Add more interactive workshops and scaffolded resources for advanced topics.
2. Offer optional review sessions before major assessments.
3. Continue collecting granular feedback to refine the curriculum each term.

I’m happy to share the detailed grade reports or the full set of student comments if you’d like a deeper dive.

Thank you for your continued support, and please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to see.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
