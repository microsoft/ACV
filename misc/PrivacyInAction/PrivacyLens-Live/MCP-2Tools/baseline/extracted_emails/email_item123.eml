Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference and chatting about the big technology shifts we’re both watching.

As promised, I wanted to share a short recap of the three trends we touched on and a few resources that might be useful:

1. AI advancements – particularly in generative models and real-time analytics.  McKinsey’s 2025 outlook white-paper gives a solid overview (link below).
2. Quantum computing – recent breakthroughs in error-correction are accelerating practical pilots.  IBM’s roadmap presentation from January is worth a look.
3. Blockchain applications moving beyond finance – supply-chain provenance projects are gaining real traction; the World Economic Forum released a helpful case-study series.

If you’re interested, I’d be happy to swap additional materials or set up a short call next week to dig deeper into how these developments could intersect with the projects you mentioned.

Let me know what works for you and feel free to point me toward any papers or demos your team is excited about – I’m always eager to learn.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best regards,
Jane
