Hello MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you are doing well. As we approach the scheduled software update to our scheduling and management system on April 15th, we would like to outline a few needs and questions to ensure a smooth transition for our staff and, most importantly, for our patients.

1. Downtime Window & Duration
   • Ideal window: after-hours on April 15th (any time after 8:00 PM) with an estimated downtime of no more than 3–4 hours.
   • Please confirm the exact start/end times so we can coordinate staff and patient communication.

2. Patient-Data Integrity & Security
   • We ask for written confirmation that all patient data will remain intact and fully accessible immediately after the update.
   • If any additional security measures (e.g., new encryption protocols) will be introduced, please provide details so our compliance team can prepare documentation.

3. Appointment-Scheduling Continuity
   • April 16-18 is one of our busiest periods (over 50 patient appointments and several outpatient procedures). We plan to implement a manual/paper back-up process during the maintenance window.
   • Could you provide a one-click export (CSV or PDF) of the appointment schedule for those dates so our staff can reference it offline?

4. Staff Training & Documentation
   • Please share release notes and user documentation at least one week in advance (by April 8th) so we can circulate them internally.
   • If a sandbox or test environment is available, we would like access no later than April 10th for quick hands-on training sessions.

5. Post-Update Support
   • Kindly provide the best point of contact for real-time support during/after the update.
   • We also appreciate a short virtual debrief within 48 hours post-deployment to review any issues or questions.

Let us know if any of these requests require clarification or adjustment on our end. We appreciate your partnership and look forward to the new features this update will bring.

Thank you in advance for your help.
