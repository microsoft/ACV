Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out.

I understand the buzz that has been circulating, and I want to assure you that there are no surprise restructures or layoffs on the horizon. The leadership team has been looking at ways to strengthen our operations and support growth for the year ahead. So far the most visible outcome is the launch of a few company-wide initiatives—like the upcoming TeamBoost workshops—which are aimed at improving collaboration and professional development across teams.

Beyond that, any organisational adjustments we make will be incremental and communicated well in advance. Protecting our people and our culture is a top priority, and everyone’s roles—including yours—remain secure.

If anything more formal develops I’ll keep the team updated right away, but for now it’s very much business as usual. Please feel free to drop by or give me a call if you have other questions or concerns.

Thanks again for checking in, and speak soon.

Best,
Jane
