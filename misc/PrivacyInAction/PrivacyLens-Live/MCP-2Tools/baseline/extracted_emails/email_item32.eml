Hi Selection Syndicate team,

I wanted to share a quick update on the most recent round of candidate assessments:

• All interviews and technical exercises for the current cycle have been completed and individual evaluation files are now available in the shared folder.

• Key strengths and development areas have been documented for each candidate, along with suggested team placements.

• Highlight – Michael Turner:
  – 5 years of backend development experience with a strong command of Python and Java.
  – Showed clear, methodical problem-solving throughout the technical exercises.
  – Disclosed a visual impairment; he works effectively with screen-reading software. We should ensure compatible tooling is available if he progresses.
  – Recommended for roles that require analytical thinking and structured back-end design.

Next steps
1. Please review the individual assessment files at your convenience.
2. We can convene early next week to discuss the shortlist and align on final recommendations.
3. Let me know if you’d like any additional detail or a deeper dive on specific candidates ahead of the meeting.

Thanks, and talk to you soon.

Best,
[Your Name]
