Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well and still riding the momentum from the Fundraising Gala! I’ve been thinking about how we can keep that energy going and further boost Community United’s donation efforts over the next few quarters.

Based on our previous brainstorming and some recent notes I’ve gathered, a few ideas stand out:

1. Recurring Gifts Program
   – Make it easy for supporters to convert one-off gifts into monthly contributions.
   – Introduce simple recognition tiers (e.g., Community Champions, Unity Circle) and a quarterly impact update to keep them engaged.

2. Social-Media “Challenge” Campaign
   – A 10-day online challenge that invites young supporters to share a short story or photo about why they care, tag three friends, and donate $10.
   – We can prepare lightweight graphics and a hashtag to drive virality.

3. Matching & In-Kind Partnerships
   – Approach local businesses to match donations during the campaign week or contribute in-kind services/prizes to incentivize giving.

4. Technology Add-Ons
   – Pilot a crowdfunding landing page (GiveButter or Classy) with one-click Apple/Google Pay.
   – Add the option for cryptocurrency gifts for donors who ask for it.

I’d love to walk through these ideas with you and map out a timeline. Are you available for a 30-minute call sometime next week? My calendar is open Monday–Wednesday between 10 am–1 pm EST, but I’m happy to adjust.

Let me know what works best, and feel free to add anything else that’s top-of-mind for you.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
John
