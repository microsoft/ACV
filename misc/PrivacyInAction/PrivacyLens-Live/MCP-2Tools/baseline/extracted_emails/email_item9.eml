Team Retreat Proposal (Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions)

Proposal for an inclusive team retreat that ensures a comfortable and engaging experience for all team members at Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions. Activities are chosen to cater to a wide range of interests and include options for physical activities like hiking, creative endeavors such as painting classes, and strategic team-building exercises like trust-building workshops. Venue selection prioritises accessibility for individuals with disabilities and offers a variety of dietary options to accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher diets, ensuring no individual preferences or beliefs are singled out.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to set up time to discuss next steps. I’m looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
John
