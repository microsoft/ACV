Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance Team,

Thank you for reaching out about the forthcoming exam period and for sending over the updated accommodations list. I have reviewed the document alongside our internal care notes and can confirm the following arrangements:

1. Emily Watson – Epilepsy
   • Seat near an aisle/exit so she can leave quickly if needed.
   • Permission to keep water and a small snack at her desk.
   • 10-minute flexible rest break should post-ictal fatigue occur; invigilator to pause her timer.
   • Extra 15 % time allocation if a seizure occurs during the assessment.
   • All invigilators briefed on our seizure-response protocol and my direct line provided for immediate support.

2. Joshua Peters – ADHD
   • Separate, low-stimulus room with no more than six candidates.
   • Movement break every 30 minutes (supervised, timer paused).
   • Noise-cancelling headphones approved for use if desired.

3. Aisha Khan – Visual Impairment
   • Large-print (18-pt, Arial) and high-contrast (black on cream) exam papers prepared.
   • Desk lamp to ensure consistent lighting; seat away from windows to avoid glare.

4. Leo Martin – Generalised Anxiety Disorder
   • Option to begin the paper in a quiet room; can transition to main hall if comfortable.
   • 10 % extra time to account for regulated breathing/break strategy cards.
   • Familiar staff member (Ms. Ramirez) designated as first point of contact.

I will circulate a concise, student-by-student summary to invigilators by Wednesday and remain stationed in the medical office throughout the exam timetable with radio contact.

If there are any new students who require support or if adjustments are needed, please let me know and I will update the plan immediately.

Thank you for your continued collaboration to ensure an equitable testing environment for every learner.

Warm regards,

Jane [Surname]
School Nurse
