Hello Team,

I hope you are all doing well. As we continue to improve both our physical workspace and the way we work together, I’d like to share two important sets of updates that will impact everyone over the next several weeks.

1) Office Renovation
• Start date: next Monday (28 Feb) and expected to last approximately four weeks.
• Scope: The renovation will focus on the ground floor, including the common work areas and break room.
• Temporary relocation: During this period, all employees who normally sit on the ground floor will work from the upper floors. Signage will guide you to your temporary desks.
• Meeting rooms & amenities: Some rooms will be offline; please use the updated meeting-room calendar to book available spaces. Vending machines and coffee stations on the upper floors remain open.
• Remote work: Managers may approve remote-work days if space becomes tight—coordinate directly with your supervisor.

2) Transition to the AgileBoost Workflow
• Kick-off: Week of 21 Feb.
• Timeline: ~6-week implementation (analysis – training – system setup – pilot – full rollout).
• Training sessions: First hands-on workshops run 1–4 Mar. A detailed schedule and sign-up link will follow shortly—attendance is required for all project teams.
• Benefits: AgileBoost will streamline task tracking, improve sprint visibility, and centralize communication.

Key Milestones at a Glance
• 21 Feb – AgileBoost implementation begins
• 28 Feb – Office renovation starts
• 1–4 Mar – AgileBoost training workshops
