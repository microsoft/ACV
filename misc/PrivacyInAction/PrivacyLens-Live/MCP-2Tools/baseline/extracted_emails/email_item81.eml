Hi Sarah,

As promised, I’ve pulled together the most up-to-date information we have for the Q1 marketing campaign so you have everything in one place while you work on the next round of creative and budget planning.

1. High-Level Strategy (from the Notion “Q1 Marketing Campaign Strategy” doc)
   • Primary objective: re-engage our existing client base via targeted emails and paid social ads.
   • Segmentation approach: split audiences by demographic profile and investment interest so that copy/creative can be personalised (see demographics below).
   • Core channels: nurture email series, LinkedIn Sponsored Content, Instagram retargeting; secondary support from display re-marketing.
   • Timeline: Weeks 1–8 acquisition push; Weeks 9–12 nurture & upsell.

2. Audience Demographics (aggregate view)
   • Age: 30–45 is the core band – early list analysis shows ~42 % aged 25-34 and ~38 % aged 35-44 (the two segments you asked for).  
   • Average account size: USD 100 k – 500 k.  
   • Top investment interests: Real Estate, Technology startups; sustainable-investment interest is strongest in the 35-44 cohort.  
   • NOTE: Data is aggregated and contains no personal client details.

3. Current Performance Snapshot (campaign weeks 1–4)
   • Total impressions: 1 ,254 ,678  
   • Click-through rate (CTR): 3.45 %  
   • Conversion rate: 2.15 %  
   • Revenue generated to-date: USD 78 ,420  
   • Ad spend to-date: USD 31 ,600 ⇒ preliminary ROI ≈ 148 %.  

4. Initial Observations & Next Steps
   • CTR and overall ROI are on-track, but LinkedIn CPC is ~17 % above forecast – testing new creative variants this week.  
   • Engagement in the 25-34 segment is higher on Instagram while the 35-44 segment skews toward LinkedIn; we’ll build this into channel budgets.  
   • I’m pulling a deeper demographic performance deck (breakdowns + post-transaction retention metrics) and will have that to you by Thursday morning.  

Please let me know if any other details would help, or if you’d like to hop on a quick call to walk through the numbers together.

Best regards,
John
