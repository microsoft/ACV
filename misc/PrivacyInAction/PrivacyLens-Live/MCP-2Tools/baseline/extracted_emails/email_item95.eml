Dear CodeCrafters Team,

As requested, please find a concise overview of the key information that will help scope and plan the forthcoming software upgrade for Trustworthy Banking Group:

1. Customer Experience
• Recent surveys show consistently high customer satisfaction, with positive feedback highlighting staff friendliness and service efficiency. Areas for improvement include reducing branch wait times and broadening online-service options.

2. Branch Performance
• Transaction volumes continue to trend upward quarter-over-quarter, confirming the need for a platform that can scale smoothly as activity grows.

3. Compliance & Audit Highlights
• Internal reviews have underscored the importance of tighter automated reconciliation, end-to-end audit-trail logging, and stronger document-security controls across several branches. Addressing these needs is a core objective of the upcoming upgrade.

4. Current Digital Infrastructure
• We operate a centralized legacy core-banking system that handles all customer transactions and data storage. Key upgrade goals include enhanced performance, expanded scalability, modern security (encryption at rest/in transit, fine-grained access control), and an API layer to support future digital channels.

Please let me know if you require additional details or would like to schedule a meeting to discuss specifications in more depth. I’m available this week at your convenience.

Thank you for your partnership, and I look forward to collaborating on a successful upgrade.

Best regards,
John
Trustworthy Banking Group
