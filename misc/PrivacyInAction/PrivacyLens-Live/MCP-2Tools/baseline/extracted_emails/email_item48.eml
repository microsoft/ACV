Dear Oakwood Owlet Parents,

I hope you are all doing well. With the Oakwood Owlets’ group science-fair project due on March 15, I’d like to get everyone on the same page regarding timeline, materials, and volunteer roles.

Key Dates
• February 28 – All recycled materials gathered
• March 7 – Prototype assembly & test session
• March 12 – Presentation boards finalized
• March 15 – Science-fair submission

Proposed Work Sessions
• Sat, February 24, 10 a.m.–12 p.m. at my house (garage workspace)
• Thu, March 7, 4 p.m.–6 p.m. in the school library makerspace

How You Can Help
1. Materials Coordinator – Track what parts we already have and what still needs to be sourced.
2. Snack Coordinator – Provide light snacks/drinks for the two work sessions.
3. Transport Support – Help move the finished project to school on March 15.

Please reply by Wednesday, February 21 letting me know (a) whether your child can attend the proposed sessions and (b) if you are able to take on one of the volunteer roles above (or suggest another way to help).

I’ll keep everyone informed through this email thread and will also upload photos/notes in the shared Google Drive folder.

Thank you so much for supporting our young engineers! I’m looking forward to creating something great together.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
Oakwood Owlets Parent Coordinator
