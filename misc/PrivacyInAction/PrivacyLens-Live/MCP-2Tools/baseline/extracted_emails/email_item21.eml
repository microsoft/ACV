Hi Alex,

I’ve finished reviewing your project and wanted to share some feedback.

Strengths
• You demonstrate a solid grasp of the course material and underlying theory.
• Your data analysis is well-executed, and the visualizations effectively support your findings.
• The overall presentation is clear and easy to follow.

Areas to strengthen
• Try to state your hypothesis more concisely up front; sharpening its wording will focus the reader and guide the rest of the paper.
• Likewise, tightening the wording of your research question will help structure your analysis and conclusions.

Overall, this was good work and I’ve assigned it a B+. With a bit more refinement of the framing sections, I’m confident the project could reach an excellent level.

If you’d like to discuss any of this feedback or talk through ways to strengthen the paper further, feel free to stop by office hours or let me know and we can arrange another time.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
