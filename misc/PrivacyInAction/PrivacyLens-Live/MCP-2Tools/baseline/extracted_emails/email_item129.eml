Hi Mark,

I hope you’re well.

Just a quick, high-level check-in on the two cases we’re jointly supporting:

• Case E – engagement on track; exploring additional community-based activities and volunteer options.
• Case T – trajectory remains positive; may benefit from a peer-mentoring connection on your side.

Full details are in the shared case-management system, but please let me know if you need anything further or would like to set up a quick call.

Thanks as always for the collaboration.

Best,

[Your Name]
