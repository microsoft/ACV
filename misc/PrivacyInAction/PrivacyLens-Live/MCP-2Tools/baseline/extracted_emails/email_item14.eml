Hello Vitality Partners Team,

Thank you for your ongoing support as we evaluate HealthHub for our employee wellness programme. I wanted to share an up-to-date overview of the key requirements we’ve identified on our side so your team can confirm feasibility and prepare the appropriate materials.

Core Requirements
• Seamless integration with our existing wellness initiatives (e.g., OptiLife 10-k Steps Challenge, Mindful March Meditation Series).
• Ability to track individual employee health goals and progress (steps, BMI, meditation streaks, etc.).
• Personalised health insights and recommendations for each employee.
• A catalogue of configurable wellness challenges with reward/recognition options to boost engagement.
• Secure data handling plus an analytics dashboard that shows aggregated participation metrics while protecting individual privacy.

Indicative Timeline
We aim to complete platform evaluation by late June, with a view to an August company-wide roll-out. A live demo or proof-of-concept by mid-June would help keep us on track.

Next Steps / Information Requested
1. Please confirm whether the above functionality is available out-of-the-box or would require additional configuration.
2. Provide a short technical overview of integration points (SSO, data export options, API or webhook availability, etc.).
3. Share preliminary pricing for approximately 750 employees.
4. Let us know your availability for a demo during the week of 3–7 June.

If there is any documentation you need from us ahead of time, just let me know and I’ll arrange it.

Thank you again, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
