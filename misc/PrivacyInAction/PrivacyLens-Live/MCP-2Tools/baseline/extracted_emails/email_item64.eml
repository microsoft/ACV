Hi Sarah,

Welcome to Carter & Goldstein. We’re excited to have you on the team.

Below is a concise overview of where things stand on our marquee matter, Case #7643. I’ve pulled the most recent internal updates for your orientation; full documents are available in the case folder on the secure portal.

1. Latest Evidence Breakthrough
• New documentary evidence surfaced last week that bolsters our primary theory of liability. The discovery team is authenticating the source, but early indications are that it significantly strengthens our position.
• A refreshed evidence summary has been prepared (Feb-05) and circulated internally. Please review when you have a moment.

2. Confidential Witness List
• Investigation has produced a preliminary roster of key and supporting witnesses, including several former employees and two outside experts.
• The list is marked HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – let me know if you’d like direct access or a quick briefing.

3. Strategy Alignment
• At the Feb-08 strategy session we confirmed the core arguments we’ll advance and assigned drafting responsibilities for upcoming motions.
• Deadlines:
  – Draft dispositive motions due for partner review: Monday, Feb-14
  – Mock deposition session (witness prep): date to be finalised this week
  – Evidence authentication memo: Friday, Feb-18

4. Next Touch-Points
• We have a brief internal call scheduled for Thursday at 10:00 AM to finalise the deposition schedule and discuss how the new evidence affects timing.
• I’ll ensure you’re added to all recurring invites and given access to the Teams channel/document repository.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or if you’d like a deeper dive into any facet of the file. We’re looking forward to your insights and leadership on this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Carter & Goldstein LLP
