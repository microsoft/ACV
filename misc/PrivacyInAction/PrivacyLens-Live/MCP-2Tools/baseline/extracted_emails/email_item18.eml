Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in how Union Trust Bank safeguards customers through our dispute-resolution programme. Below is an overview of the standard process as well as details of the recent Glamour Gadgets case you mentioned.

1. Complaint Submission
   • A customer may file a dispute 24/7 via our secure online portal, by phone (1-800-UTB-HELP) or in person at any branch.
   • A brief web-form (or equivalent phone/branch record) captures the transaction in question, date, amount and the customer’s explanation together with any supporting documents (e-receipt, screenshots, police report, etc.).

2. Case Creation & Acknowledgement
   • Our system assigns a unique case number automatically.
   • The customer receives written acknowledgement within 24 hours that the case is open and being reviewed.

3. Preliminary Review (Day 1–2)
   • A specialist verifies the transaction details and screens for obvious errors (duplicate charges, processing glitches, etc.).
   • If additional information is needed, we contact the customer immediately.

4. Merchant Outreach (Day 2–5)
   • For card-based transactions we submit a formal charge-back notice to the acquiring bank and request the merchant’s written response and proof of authorisation.
   • The merchant has up to 7 calendar days to reply electronically through the card-network portal.

5. Evidence Evaluation & Decision (Typically by Day 10; complex cases may require up to 45 days as permitted under Regulation E/Z)
   • Our analysts compare the customer’s evidence with the merchant’s submission and the network’s fraud indicators.
   • A decision matrix that weighs authorisation quality, merchandise delivery confirmation and customer history guides the outcome.

6. Customer Notification & Remedy
   • The customer is informed of our decision by secure message, e-mail and (for credit-card disputes) on the next monthly statement.
   • If the dispute is upheld we issue a provisional credit within 1 business day and convert it to a permanent credit after the card-network’s representment window closes.

Example – Glamour Gadgets (Credit-Card Transaction of $4,500)
• Complaint filed: 4 Oct 2021
• Merchant response received: 9 Oct 2021 (insufficient proof of delivery)
• Decision: 12 Oct 2021 – dispute upheld, full refund issued
• Final settlement: 30 Oct 2021 when the merchant opted not to contest further.

Forms & Documentation
• Standard Dispute Form (auto-generated in the portal or provided as a PDF).
• Recommended attachments: proof of purchase cancellation, any correspondence with merchant, shipment tracking, photographs, police report (if applicable).

Escalation & Independence
• If a customer disagrees with the outcome, they may request a secondary review by our Quality Assurance team or escalate to the Banking Ombudsman.  
• All dispute investigators sit in a dedicated unit separate from frontline sales to preserve impartiality.

Key Timelines at a Glance
• Acknowledgement: within 24 h
• Preliminary review: 48 h
• Typical resolution: ≤10 business days (simple) / ≤45 calendar days (complex, cross-border or fraud-investigation cases)

We continuously refine the programme to meet evolving regulatory requirements and card-network rules. Should you need statistics, customer-satisfaction metrics or wish to speak with one of our dispute-resolution managers, please let me know and I will arrange it.
