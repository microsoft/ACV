Hello Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m excited to be partnering again with Helping Hands United for our upcoming Community Care Day on Tuesday, March 15th at St. Mary’s Parish Hall and surrounding grounds.

Below is a concise overview of the event and the items that still need attention. Please let me know if anything looks off or if you’d like additional information.

Location
• St. Mary’s Parish Hall & Outdoor Courtyard – 275 Oak St.

Purpose
• Bring neighbors together for a day of practical support and fellowship: complimentary hot meals, basic health screenings, a mini-job fair with local employers, and fun family activities.

Draft Agenda
• 9:00 – 9:15  Opening welcome & prayer

Promotion
• Flyers going out this weekend
• Announcements during church services Feb 20 & 27
• Social-media posts from both our accounts beginning Feb 21

Items We Still Need to Finalize
1. Volunteer roles & shift schedule – I’ll send a draft sign-up sheet once parish numbers are firm.
2. Parish Hall board confirmation – expecting approval this week.
3. Extra tables/chairs for the job-fair area – checking rental availability.
4. List of participating employers – could you share any contacts HHU has confirmed so far?
5. Medical screening supplies – our clinic partner will provide most items, but I may need to borrow two extra blood-pressure cuffs.

Next-Step Meeting
Could we schedule a 30-minute touch-base next week (Mon 21st or Wed 23rd, anytime 10 a.m.–2 p.m.)? Let me know what works best for you.

Thank you again for your partnership and all that you and HHU do for our community. Looking forward to making this day a success together!

Blessings,
