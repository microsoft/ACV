Hi Mark,

Hope you're well. As promised, here are the most up-to-date details for the Helping Hands Foundation Charity Gala:

Date: Saturday, March 5th, 2022
Time: 6:00 PM – 11:00 PM
Venue: Grand Ballroom, Metropolitan Hotel

Program Highlights
• Silent auction during cocktail hour (6:00–7:30)
• Dinner service at 7:45
• Live music set between courses
• Award ceremony and remarks at 9:00
• Closing reception 10:15–11:00

Guest Speaker
Mr. Thomas Anderson has kindly agreed to deliver the keynote address during the award ceremony. I’ll confirm his final talking points with him next week.

Action Items
1. Volunteer team – could you please finalize assignments for registration, auction spotting, and table ushers?
2. Guest list – the hotel needs the final headcount by Friday, Feb 18. Let me know once you’ve locked this.
3. Tech/audio – please coordinate with the hotel AV manager so Mr. Anderson has a lapel mic and clicker ready for an 8:55 sound-check.

Let me know if anything is missing or if you need more information from my end. Happy to jump on a quick call early next week.

Thanks as always for your help!

Best regards,
