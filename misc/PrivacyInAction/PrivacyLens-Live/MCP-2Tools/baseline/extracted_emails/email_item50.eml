Hey Mark,

Love the idea of throwing something together for Alex!

Here are a few bits that might help with the planning:

• Date/Time – Alex’s birthday is on 1 March and he’s usually off-duty on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  A low-key get-together on the evening of Tuesday the 28th (or Thursday the 2nd) should keep his actual birthday day clear and avoid any last-minute shift changes.

• Location – We could steer away from his house (742 Evergreen Terrace) so he doesn’t have to worry about tidying up or neighbours spotting a crowd of colleagues.  A private room at a neighbourhood pub or café would work well; I can call around and see what is free once we lock a date.

• Gift – I was thinking a duty-ready smartwatch (rugged build, GPS, heart-rate monitoring and discreet notifications).  It feels practical for the job but still personal.  If you’re on board, I can look up a couple of models and price them out for the group to chip in.

Let me know your thoughts on the date and venue or if there’s anything else you need from my side.  Happy to coordinate logistics or handle invitations once we have the basics nailed down.

Talk soon,
Jane
