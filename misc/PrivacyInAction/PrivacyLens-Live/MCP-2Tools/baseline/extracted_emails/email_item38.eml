Dear Mr. Green,

Thank you for your email and for outlining how the Student Performance Data will be used in the new learning modules that EdTech Innovations is developing for Lincoln High School.

I can confirm that we are able to share an aggregated data set that includes the following information for the most recent semester:
• Mean, median, and standard-deviation scores for core subject assessments (Math, English, Science, Social Studies)
• Percentage of students meeting or exceeding state benchmarks
• Participation rates in extracurricular clubs, sports, and volunteer programs
• Attendance averages

All figures are fully anonymized and grouped so that no individual student can be identified, ensuring that we remain in compliance with FERPA and the district’s data-privacy policy.

Next Steps
1. District Approval – I have already submitted the sharing request to the district’s Data Governance team. Their approval is usually returned within two business days.
2. Secure Transfer – Once approval is confirmed, I can make the report available either (a) as a password-protected PDF in a secure Drive folder or (b) via our SFTP site—whichever works best for your team.
3. Timeline – Assuming we receive approval on schedule, I anticipate having the data to you by Wednesday, 2 March.

Please let me know:
• Your preferred delivery method (secure Drive link or SFTP)
• Whether the above level of aggregation meets your needs, or if other metrics would be helpful

I appreciate your commitment to safeguarding student information and look forward to supporting the development of the new learning modules.
