Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is [Your Name] and I’m coordinating a new Community Sports Program designed to engage local youth in a range of athletic activities while promoting teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles.

Because the Active Youth Foundation’s mission so perfectly aligns with what we’re trying to accomplish, I wanted to reach out and explore ways we might collaborate. Our early concept includes:
• Weekly multi-sport sessions (soccer, basketball, track & field, etc.)
• Workshops on nutrition, leadership, and goal-setting
• Partnerships with local schools and sports clubs to ensure wide participation

I’d love to hear your thoughts on how AYF might like to be involved—whether through coaching expertise, equipment support, volunteer coordination, or co-branding the program.

Would you be available for a brief call or virtual meeting sometime next week? I’m flexible and can adjust to a time that works best for you.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I’m excited about the potential impact we could make together and look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
