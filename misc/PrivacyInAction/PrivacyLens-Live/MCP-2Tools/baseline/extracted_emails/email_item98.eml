Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to send you a brief update on a few of our patients and the Community Wellness Program in general:

• Tom – He is still experiencing notable post-operative pain that limits his mobility, but his overall recovery is progressing. Importantly, he hasn’t missed a single “Healing Together” support-group session and he says the resources that Helping Hands Foundation provided have been instrumental in keeping him motivated and informed.

• Jane Doe – She has confirmed that she will attend the next “Healing Together” session and is enthusiastic about connecting with others in similar circumstances.

Program snapshot – Over the past month we’ve seen strong engagement across the board. Attendance at support-group meetings remains high, and several patients have made a point of letting us know how much they value the sense of community and the practical tools HHF offers.

Thank you, as always, for everything you and the Helping Hands Foundation team do to make these services possible. Let me know if you need any additional details or if there’s anything else I can provide.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
