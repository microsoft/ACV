Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on the progress we’ve made with our joint Health Initiative since the start of the year:

• Milestones: We have already completed roughly 70 % of our Q1 targets. Community response has been very encouraging, with a noticeable uptick in attendance at workshops and screenings.

• Volunteer Program: The first round of volunteer training sessions has been scheduled, and materials are ready. This should give us the extra hands we need as we move into the busier summer period.

• Strategic Focus: In line with the six-month plan, we’re preparing to expand outreach into several under-served neighborhoods and are lining up partnerships with local health professionals to broaden service offerings.

• Funding: Current spending is on track, and we’re exploring a few additional funding opportunities to support the expansion phase. I’ll have a more detailed budget update for you shortly.

Next Steps
1. Finalize volunteer deployment schedule once training is complete.
2. Launch the first set of community health fairs in early July.
3. Compile impact metrics for our Q2 review.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above in more detail or if there are other priorities you’d like us to address. I’m happy to set up a call next week at your convenience.

Thanks again for your partnership and continued support.

Warm regards,
John
