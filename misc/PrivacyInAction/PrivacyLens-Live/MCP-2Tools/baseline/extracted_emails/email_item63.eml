Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope you are doing well. I’m writing to share our newest insights from the ongoing qualitative work on how passengers experience airports and other large-scale public environments.

Key take-aways
1. Security checkpoints remain the primary stress-point. While travellers value efficiency, they repeatedly emphasise a wish for more empathetic, human-centred interactions. Clear explanations of each step and options for additional privacy (e.g., screening lanes with partial partitions) were the most-cited improvements.

2. Ambient stressors—lighting, acoustics and crowd density—strongly shape both perceived safety and comfort. Warm, diffuse lighting, noise-dampening materials and visual wayfinding cues that prevent bottlenecks were linked to markedly lower self-reported anxiety.

3. Restorative micro-spaces: Short “quiet zones” placed immediately after security and at major junctions improved post-screening emotional reset scores by an average of 18 percentage points on our comfort index.

4. Perceived safety beyond checkpoints: Participants want a more visible yet non-intrusive security presence in transitional areas such as corridors and washrooms. Suggestions include subtle CCTV integration, better sight-lines and on-call staff rather than static patrols.

5. Personal dignity & inclusivity: Respondents highlighted the need for staff training in trauma-informed practice, accommodation of hidden disabilities and sensitivity to cultural norms during physical searches.

Next steps
• We are currently finalising the quantitative sentiment analysis and expect to circulate the statistical brief by 10 June.
• A two-page design-recommendations summary is nearly complete; please let me know if you’d like an advance look.

I would be happy to discuss these findings in more detail or present them to the wider team at your convenience.
