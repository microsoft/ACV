Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for the kind words about my work. I would be honored to contribute to Vital Voices and help amplify awareness around HIV and the lived experiences behind the diagnosis.

I’m comfortable either writing a guest article or taking part in an interview—whichever format best fits your editorial calendar. For an article, I can deliver a 1,200–1,500-word piece that weaves together my personal journey since my 2015 diagnosis, the challenges I’ve encountered, and the practical lessons I’ve learned about testing, treatment adherence, and confronting stigma. If you prefer an interview, I’m available next week on Tuesday or Thursday between 1:00–4:00 p.m. ET and would be happy to connect via Zoom or phone.

Please let me know which option you’d like to pursue and any guidelines (word count, deadline, tone, preferred angle) you have in mind. I can also provide photos or additional background material as needed.

Thank you again for the opportunity. I look forward to collaborating with you and the Vital Voices team to help inform and empower your readers.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
