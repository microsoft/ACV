Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for your concern about Ethan.

Ethan was diagnosed with influenza late last week. On his pediatrician Dr. Patel’s advice, we have been keeping him at home so he can recover fully and to prevent spreading the virus to his classmates. He is responding well to rest and medication, and—if he continues to improve at the current pace—we anticipate that he will be able to return to school this Thursday, 24 February. I will send a signed note from Dr. Patel confirming his fitness to return on the day he comes back.

In the meantime, could you please let me know of any assignments or class materials he has missed so we can work on them at home? If there are additional steps we should take to support him when he returns, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

Thank you again for your understanding and for the support you and the Greenwood staff provide.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
