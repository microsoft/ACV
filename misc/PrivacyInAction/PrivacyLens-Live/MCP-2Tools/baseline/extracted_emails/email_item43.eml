Hi Lisa,

Thank you for stepping in to support Ethan! I wanted to pass along a few high-level notes that should make your first days together smoother.

1. Daily Rhythm
• Ethan really relies on a predictable schedule. He’s up around 7 AM, eats breakfast (oatmeal with sliced banana) and does some light movement/exercises.
• 10–11 AM is dedicated “puzzle time.” He looks forward to this, so keeping it consistent helps him settle into the rest of the day.
• Lunch is at 12:30 PM – he’ll usually choose a simple sandwich.
• After lunch he enjoys quiet reading or music until his therapy session at 3 PM.
• Dinner is at 6 PM, followed by a nature-focused TV show, and bedtime routine starts at 8 PM with lights out by 8:30 PM.

2. Food & Mealtime Environment
• Prefers warm foods; cold dishes (salads, yogurt, etc.) often go untouched.
• Favorite snacks: apple slices with peanut butter, or crackers with cheese.
• He’s sensitive to loud noises while eating, so a calm, low-stimulus space at meals makes a big difference.

3. Interests & Motivators
• Animals (especially zoo visits), water play/swimming, and anything creative like drawing or painting.
• Puzzles are a huge motivator—offering a new puzzle can be a great reward or transition tool.

4. Sensory & Communication Notes
• When he begins to feel overwhelmed, he’s learning to request a break. Having a quiet corner or sensory kit available lets him reset quickly.
• Gentle reminders to use his words or break card can head off meltdowns.

5. Therapy Progress Highlights
• Actively practicing asking for help or breaks when needed.
• Beginning to initiate play with peers—lots of positive reinforcement here goes a long way.

Quick Tips
• Visual schedules or simple countdown timers help him prepare for transitions.
• Offer choices (two options) rather than open-ended questions – it reduces decision fatigue.
• Keep art supplies and a favourite puzzle handy for downtime or as incentives.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you’d like more detail on any of the above.

I’m excited for Ethan to work with you and I know he’ll thrive under your care!

Best,
[Your Name]
