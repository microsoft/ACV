Dear Academic Alliance Team,

I hope you’re all doing well!

I’m writing to confirm the details of our next study session so everyone can plan ahead:

Date: Monday, May 20
Time: 10:00 AM – 12:15 PM
Location: Library – Group Study Room (same room as last time)

Proposed Agenda
1. Quick recap of last week’s key concepts
2. Discussion on new material (Chapters 4 & 5)
3. Group exercises focused on statistical methods
4. Mid-term preparation and Q&A

Feel free to suggest additional items or let me know if you have any questions before we meet. Please bring any notes, textbooks, or laptops you’ll need.

Looking forward to a productive session!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
