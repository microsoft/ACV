Hi Mark,

I hope you’re well.

I’m Alex Johnson, Community Engagement Coordinator at SecureNow Insurance. Over the past few months we’ve been exploring ways to broaden our social impact, and the work Helping Hands Charity does in supporting families and communities resonates deeply with our mission.

We believe there’s strong potential for a collaboration that combines SecureNow’s financial-protection expertise with Helping Hands’ community reach. Our initial concept is a joint initiative that would provide comprehensive support—such as emergency funding, insurance education, and essential supplies—to families recovering from natural disasters.

I’d love to set up a brief call early next week to discuss:
• The specific needs you’re seeing on the ground
• Potential program structure and budget commitments from SecureNow
• Mutual promotion strategies to maximize visibility for both organizations
• Coordination processes to ensure rapid response when disasters strike

Please let me know a time that suits you, and I’ll gladly make it work. If you’d prefer, I can also share a more detailed overview ahead of our conversation.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I’m excited about the possibility of working together.

Best regards,
Alex Johnson
