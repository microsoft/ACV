Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on our student volunteer’s involvement with Helping Hands Foundation this semester.

• Attendance & Hours
The student has volunteered consistently every week since early March and has accumulated a substantial number of hours (records are available in our internal log). Notably, they arrive early for each shift and are usually the last to leave, ensuring all tasks are wrapped up.

• Roles Undertaken
– Event set-up/break-down for the Spring Food Drive and Senior Outreach Day  
– Registration desk assistance during the April Health Fair  
– Inventory sorting and distribution in the food pantry

• Performance Feedback
Feedback from multiple team members has been overwhelmingly positive. They are described as punctual, eager to assist with any task, and able to motivate other volunteers through their upbeat attitude. Staff have also highlighted their initiative in identifying small process improvements (for example, reorganizing the donation intake area to speed up sorting).

• Looking Ahead
The student is scheduled to continue volunteering on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons through the end of June and has already signed up for the Summer Backpack Drive on July 6.

Please let me know if you need any additional details or formal documentation of their hours. Thank you for providing such a supportive environment for our students to give back to the community.

Best regards,
