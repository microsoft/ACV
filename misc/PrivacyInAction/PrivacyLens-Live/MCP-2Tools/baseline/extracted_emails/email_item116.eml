Dear Alex,

Thank you for your email. I’m glad to hear you’re getting an early start on your preparation.

For our upcoming exam you’ll want to review material from the first eight weeks of the course. In particular, make sure you are comfortable with the following broad areas:

1. Cryptography fundamentals
   • Symmetric- vs. asymmetric-key encryption, common algorithms and typical use cases  
   • Hash functions, digital signatures and certificates

2. Network security concepts
   • Architecture of firewalls, IDS/IPS and VPNs  
   • Common attack vectors (e.g., spoofing, sniffing, man-in-the-middle) and corresponding counter-measures

3. Risk management & security policy
   • The basic risk equation, qualitative vs. quantitative assessment  
   • Elements of an effective security policy and incident-response plan

4. Cyber-ethics and legal considerations
   • Responsibilities of organizations following a data breach  
   • Relevant legislation and standards we discussed in class

5. Case-study analysis
   • Be ready to apply the above concepts to a real-world scenario similar to those covered in the weekly discussions and lab reports.

Exam format: a mix of multiple-choice questions, short written answers, and one scenario-based question that will ask you to justify your chosen security controls.

Helpful resources:
• Lecture slides and recorded sessions (Weeks 1-8)  
• Labs 1-4 and their write-ups  
• Required readings listed in the syllabus, especially Chapters 2, 4, 6 and 8 of the textbook

If anything is unclear or you’d like more guidance, feel free to drop by office hours (Wed 2-4 pm) or let me know and we can set up a quick call.

Best of luck with your studies—I’m confident you’ll do well.

Best regards,
Professor Doe
