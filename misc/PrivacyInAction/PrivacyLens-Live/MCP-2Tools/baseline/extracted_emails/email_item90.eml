Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m excited about the momentum we’re building around our joint initiative to provide counseling support for community members.

Here’s a quick status update and a few items I’d like to confirm with you:

1. Volunteer List
I have compiled an initial roster of volunteers on our side who are interested in taking part. Could you please let me know how many volunteers you have confirmed on your side? Once we combine our lists, I’ll prepare a consolidated contact sheet.

2. Training Sessions
Based on our earlier conversation, I’ve sketched out two possible windows for the initial training:
   • One weekend morning in late March
   • One mid-week evening in late March
Please let me know which option works best for your team or if we should consider alternatives.

3. Training Content
I’d like to integrate some general insights from our existing counseling program into the volunteer training—covering active-listening techniques, basic crisis-response steps, and guidance on when to refer individuals for professional help. Feel free to share any materials or topics you’d like us to include.

4. Next Check-In
Would you be available for a brief planning call early next week to finalize the volunteer list and lock in the training date?

Thank you again for partnering with us on this project. Together we can make a meaningful difference for those who need a listening ear and some extra support.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Jane
