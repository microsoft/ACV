Dear Sunny Days Families,

We hope you’re having a wonderful week! Here are a few highlights from the past several days at the center:

🎨 Collaborative Mural Project
Our little artists put their imaginations to work and created a vibrant group mural that celebrates friendship and teamwork. Every child added their own special touch, and the finished piece is now brightening up our main hallway. Be sure to take a peek during drop-off or pick-up!

💬 Sharing Feelings & Building Empathy
This week Timmy bravely opened up about what it’s like navigating school life as the child of a single parent. His classmates and teachers showed incredible empathy and support, reminding us all of the caring community we’re building together.

🤝 Introducing a “Buddy System”
To strengthen bonds even further, we’ll be rolling out a new Buddy System next week. Children will be paired with a classmate to help one another during activities, transitions, and outdoor play. We’re excited to see the friendships—and confidence—this initiative will nurture.

📆 Looking Ahead
• Photos of the mural will be shared in next week’s newsletter.
• Keep an eye out for a parent volunteer sign-up form for our upcoming Spring Celebration.

Thank you for your continued partnership and for entrusting us with your children’s growth and happiness. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.

Warmly,
[Your Name]
Director, Sunny Days Childcare Center
