Dear Professor Harrison,

Thank you for reaching out about student engagement—it's a topic I care deeply about as well. Below is a brief overview of what I’ve been doing recently, along with some observations that might be useful for our wider conversations in the department.

What seems to be working
• Opening question:  Beginning each session with a provocative, real-world question tied to the day’s reading has increased voluntary participation almost immediately.
• Concrete examples:  Bringing current news articles or short case studies into lectures helps students connect abstract theory to lived experience.
• Student-led segments:  I assign small groups to lead a 10-minute discussion or activity each week.  Not only does it diversify voices, it has noticeably boosted preparation rates.
• Real-time polls & word-clouds:  I use PollEverywhere for quick checks of understanding; the anonymity encourages quieter students to contribute.
• Low-stakes reflection prompts:  A 3-minute exit ticket asking “What was the muddiest point?” gives me rapid feedback and signals that their opinions matter.

Impact so far
• Attendance in my introductory course is up ~8 % compared with last spring despite the early-morning time slot.
• Average discussion-board posts per student have doubled after introducing student-led segments.
• Mid-semester surveys show 93 % of respondents feel the class "often" or "always" invites their active participation (up from 76 % last year).

Challenges & next steps
• Sustaining momentum late in the semester—participation dips around major assignment deadlines.  I’m experimenting with brief peer-review workshops to re-energize the room.
• Balancing depth with breadth—interactive activities take time, so I’m curating readings more aggressively.

I’d be very interested in hearing what engagement strategies you’ve found effective, and I’d welcome the chance to share these practices at our next department meeting or through a short teaching-and-learning brown-bag.

Please let me know if there are specific data points you’d like or if I can elaborate on any aspect of the methods above.

Warm regards,
Jane [Last Name]
