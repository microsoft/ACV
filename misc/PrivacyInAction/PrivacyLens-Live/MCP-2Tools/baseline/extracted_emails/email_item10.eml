Hi Sarah,

Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick progress update on Project Falcon so we’re fully aligned as we close out the implementation phase.

1. Creative Concepts
   • All core visuals, taglines, and social assets have been signed off.
   • Production is underway; the first batch of deliverables is scheduled to hit our drive by Thursday.

2. Media Planning
   • The plan is ~80 % complete. Remaining budget allocations and channel sequencing will be locked by Tuesday (21st).
   • I’ll circulate the final deck for your review as soon as Media signs off.

3. Timeline & Key Dates
   • Internal review of produced assets – 24th
   • Client preview – 27th
   • Launch window – 3–4 weeks post-preview (pending client approval)

4. Risks / Dependencies
   • No blockers at the moment.
   • I reminded the team to be extra careful when discussing project details externally to avoid accidental leaks.

5. Immediate Next Steps
   • Finalize media plan and share deck (by 21st)
   • Complete launch-readiness checklist
   • Schedule a 30-min sync early next week to walk through assets and timing

Please let me know if any of the above needs tweaking or if you’d like additional detail. If a live walkthrough helps, I’m available Monday at 10 AM or Tuesday at 2 PM—just let me know which slot works best for you.

Thanks for keeping the momentum strong and for your leadership on the marketing front. Excited to see Falcon take flight!

Best,
John
