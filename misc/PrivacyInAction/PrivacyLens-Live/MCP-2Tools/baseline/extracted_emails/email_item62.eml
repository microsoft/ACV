Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the intervention strategies our team has been refining over the past quarter.

Key elements of the current approach:
• Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) – continues to form the backbone of individual sessions and has yielded consistently positive feedback.
• Motivational Interviewing – now integrated earlier in the engagement process and showing improved client readiness for change.
• Group Therapy Sessions – we’ve expanded group sizes slightly and introduced peer-led discussion segments, which has boosted participation and cohesion.

Outcomes so far:
• Overall success rate (goal attainment across programs) is up by 14 % compared with the previous quarter.
• Clients are reporting higher resilience scores and healthier coping mechanisms on post-session assessments.
• Drop-out rates have fallen below 8 %, the lowest we’ve recorded in the past year.

Next steps:
• Continue monitoring metrics to ensure the upward trend is sustained.
• Roll out a brief skills-reinforcement module to further support CBT homework adherence.
• Gather additional qualitative feedback to refine the peer-led components.

Please let me know if you’d like any further detail or if there’s anything specific you’d like us to focus on in the next review. I’m happy to set up a call to walk through the data.

Thanks for your ongoing support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
