Dear Emily,

It’s wonderful to hear from you! Thank you for your interest in the work my team and I are doing—your curiosity always reminds me of why I love sharing these stories.

Below are a couple of recent highlights that capture both the numbers and the human side of our mission:

1) A quick success story
   Earlier this winter we worked with a client I’ll call “John.” When he arrived he was withdrawn and worried about relapsing; today he’s celebrating six months of sobriety, mentoring newcomers, and has just returned to full-time employment. Watching him rediscover his confidence has been a huge morale boost for our staff and the other residents.

2) Workshop impact snapshot
   Last month we ran an interactive workshop on coping strategies for relapse prevention. Out of 45 participants, 42 (≈93%) told us in the follow-up survey that they now feel “confident” or “very confident” applying what they learned. Many are already sharing their new skills with friends and family, creating a ripple effect beyond the centre’s walls.

3) Annual report trends
   • 78 % of the clients who complete our full residential programme maintain sobriety through the first critical year after discharge.
   • We’ve expanded community-based after-care groups by 25 % this year, which has translated into higher long-term retention in support networks.

I hope these give you a clearer picture of the impact we’re seeing on the ground. Of course, numbers only tell part of the story, but when paired with lived experiences like John’s they paint an encouraging picture of resilience.

Thanks again for asking. How are things on your side of the world? I’d love to hear about what’s been inspiring you lately as well.

Warm regards,
Jane
