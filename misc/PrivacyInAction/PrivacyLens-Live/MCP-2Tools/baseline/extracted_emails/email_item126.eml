Hi Mr. Griffin,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to send over a brief snapshot of where my current projects stand.

1. Helena Blythe’s novel, “Whispers of the Past”
   • The full developmental and line-edit phases wrapped up last week, right on schedule.
   • Helena and the team at Prestige Editorial Services were extremely pleased with the refinements to the plot twists and character arcs; they’ve formally commended the work.
   • The manuscript is now with the proofreader, and the publisher has penciled in a spring 2026 release.
   • Next steps (June): respond to any final proof queries, prepare the style sheet for the production team, and coordinate with marketing on back-cover copy.

2. Upcoming pipeline
   • I have bandwidth opening in mid-July and have started gathering briefs for two potential historical-fiction titles.
   • I’m also refining my internal process docs so that future projects move even more smoothly through editorial and hand-off.

Key dates
   • 06 Jun – finalize proofreader responses for “Whispers of the Past.”
   • 30 Jun – deliver style sheet and author QA wrap-up.
   • 15 Jul onward – available for new projects/assignments.

Please let me know if you need additional detail or would like to discuss anything in more depth.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
