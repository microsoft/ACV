Hi Emily,

It was lovely meeting you the other day—I enjoyed our chat about books and finding fresh ways to keep the page turning. You mentioned you like gathering writing resources, so I thought I’d pass along a few bite-sized insights that came up in my creative-writing class this week. Hopefully one or two spark something for you:

1.  Show the *emotional* stakes, not just the external ones.
    Instead of telling readers a character is afraid of failure, let them overhear the quiver in her voice when she asks for a second chance or notice the way she straightens trophies that don’t quite belong to her.

2.  Mine “micro-conflicts.”
    Even a scene that looks quiet on the surface hums when you give each character a tiny but incompatible goal—e.g., one wants the window open for air, the other wants it closed for privacy. Layering these frictions keeps tension alive between the major plot turns.

3.  Anchor abstract ideas in concrete, sensory details.
    My instructor’s litmus test: if you can’t sketch or taste it, it’s probably still too abstract. A feeling of "loneliness" might become the cold dent on only one side of a shared mattress.

4.  Use "the power of the almost."  
    Let resolutions land one beat later than readers expect—draw the bowstring a fraction longer. The "almost confession, almost kiss, almost discovery" leaves space for reader participation and heightens payoff when the moment finally arrives.

5.  Finish drafting before fine-tuning voice.
    Narrators evolve as the story finds its center; polishing too early can bake-in a version that no longer fits. A messy full draft gives you more clay to sculpt.

If any of these resonate, I’d love to hear how they weave into what you’re currently writing. And if you ever want another set of eyes on a piece, just let me know.

Happy writing!

Best,
[Your Name]
