Hi TechVenture Partners Team,

I hope you’re all doing well.

As part of our regular shareholder updates, I wanted to share a quick snapshot of the progress we’ve made this quarter on our two flagship initiatives at Quantum Innovations.

1. Project Alpha – Next-Gen Quantum Computer
   • Status: Prototype completed and currently running stability tests in our lab.
   • Highlights this quarter:
        – Achieved a 28 % reduction in error-rates thanks to our new correction algorithm.
        – Integrated the proprietary cryogenic cooling system that enables longer coherent operation.
   • Upcoming milestones (Q3-25):
        – File final patent package (early July).
        – Demonstrate 1,024-qubit benchmark for invited partners (late August).

2. Project Beta – Quantum-Secured Communications Platform
   • Status: System-level testing underway.
   • Highlights this quarter:
        – Completed first end-to-end quantum key distribution (QKD) over 50 km fiber without repeaters.
        – Began interoperability work with two major telecom vendors.
   • Upcoming milestones (Q3-25):
        – Field trial on a metropolitan fiber loop (target: mid-September).
        – Submit provisional patent for our adaptive QKD protocol.

Why this matters
Project Alpha positions us to deliver a step-change in computational throughput, opening doors to new revenue streams in materials simulation and cryptography services. Project Beta complements this by addressing the escalating demand for ultra-secure data channels among governments and Fortune-500 enterprises.

Next steps / support
We are preparing detailed technical white-papers that we can share under NDA once patents are filed. In the meantime, I’d welcome the opportunity to walk you through the prototypes in person or via a live demo. Let us know if you’d like to schedule a session.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder & CEO, Quantum Innovations
