Hi Sarah,

Great to hear from you, and I’m excited to help shape the upcoming First Trust Bank campaign. Below is a snapshot of the most recent customer-behavior data broken down by key demographic segments, plus a few tactical ideas you can plug straight into creative and channel planning.

1. Gen Z / Young Millennials (18-25)
• 23 % month-over-month jump in mobile-banking usage—the fastest-growing metric in the portfolio.
• Top actions: mobile check deposit and online bill pay.
• Voice of customer: “The mobile app saves me a lot of time; I’d just love a more detailed transaction history.”  
👉  Marketing angle: Lean into speed, convenience and fee-free digital features. Short-form video demos and in-app rewards test well with this cohort.

2. Established Millennials & Early Gen X (30-45)
• Newest accounts grew steadily this quarter, making this the bank’s largest expanding segment.
• They toggle between digital and in-branch touchpoints—opening accounts online, then booking appointments for advice.
• High propensity for bundled products (checking + high-yield savings, or mortgage + HELOC).
👉  Marketing angle: Emphasize “mix-and-match” product bundles and seamless transitions between app, web and branch. Consider calculator tools and quick-chat scheduling in ads.

3. Mid-life Gen X / Boomers (40-55)
• 15 % rise in branch visits compared with the previous month.
• Typical transactions: cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and setting up new savings accounts.
• Voice of customer: “I love talking to a real person—could you extend branch hours on weekends?”  
👉  Marketing angle: Spotlight knowledgeable staff, extended hours or appointment booking. Direct-mail pieces that drive to branch events still perform well here.

Cross-segment pain points & opportunities
• App transfer glitches (noted by several under-30 users) – messaging around an upcoming patch or UX refresh will reassure power users.
• Desire for richer transaction categorization – an opportunity to tease a new spending insights module.

Creative next steps
• Persona-based messaging matrix (I’m happy to draft) that maps features, tone and channels to each segment.
• Test concepts: rewards for first mobile check deposit (18-25), “Branch Concierge Day” event invite (40-55), and bundle savings calculator (30-45).

Let me know which of the above you’d like to explore further and I can pull deeper cuts of the data or mock up the messaging matrix.

Best,
John
