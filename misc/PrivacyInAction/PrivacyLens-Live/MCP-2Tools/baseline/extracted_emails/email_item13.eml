Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, I’ve put together a short list of practical wellness tips that you can begin weaving into your routine right away. Pick two or three that feel the most doable and build from there.

1. Mindful Morning Breath (5 min)
   • Before you look at your phone, sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take ten slow breaths—inhale for a count of four, exhale for six.

2. Movement Breaks
   • Set a reminder every hour to stand, stretch, or walk for two minutes. These micro-breaks reset posture, circulation, and focus.

3. 20-Minute Activity Blocks
   • Aim for at least four brisk walks, bike rides, or strength sessions this week. Consistency matters more than intensity.

4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation at Night
   • While lying in bed, tense and release each muscle group from your toes up to your forehead. This signals your nervous system that it’s time to rest.

5. Screen-Free Wind-Down
   • Power down devices 30 min before bedtime. Dim the lights, read a book, or listen to calming music instead.

6. Balanced Plate & Hydration
   • At each meal, combine lean protein, colorful veggies/fruit, and complex carbs. Keep a water bottle nearby and aim for ~2 L daily.

7. Gratitude Journaling
   • Each night jot down three things you’re grateful for. This simple exercise can shift mindset and improve sleep quality.

8. Social Check-In
   • Schedule one meaningful conversation (call, coffee, or walk) with a friend or family member mid-week to boost mood and connection.

9. Digital Detox Block
   • Pick a two-hour window this weekend to be completely phone-free. Use the time for a hobby, nature, or unstructured rest.

10. Compassionate Self-Talk
    • When stress or self-criticism pops up, pause and ask, “What would I say to a good friend in this moment?” Offer yourself that same kindness.

Feel free to adapt any of these suggestions to fit your schedule and energy level. Let me know which ones resonate, and we can discuss how they’re working for you during our next session (Thursday at 3 PM).

Take care and talk soon,
