Hi [Project Manager Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed, I’m sharing the consolidated requirements and timeline for the Performance Tracking System (PTS) we’re building together for Acme Corp.

1. Core Objectives
• Deliver real-time visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as project completion rate, sales-target attainment, and customer-service response time.
• Provide role-based, fully customizable dashboards so users can focus on metrics most relevant to their goals.
• Offer seamless, secure integration with Acme’s existing Human Resources Information System (HRIS) to unify performance and HR data.

2. Functional Requirements
• Real-time analytics engine capable of ingesting and processing data from multiple sources with <5-minute latency.
• Widget-based dashboard builder with drag-and-drop configuration.
• KPI definition module that allows administrators to add/modify metrics without code changes.
• Alerting & notification framework (email, Slack, MS Teams) triggered by threshold breaches.
• Role-based access control aligned with Acme’s SSO (Okta) groups.

3. Integration Requirements
• REST/GraphQL API connection to the HRIS for employee profile, role, training, and review data.
• Daily synchronization of org-chart hierarchy.
• SAML 2.0 SSO for authentication.
• Data encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).

4. High-Level Timeline
• Project kick-off: 01 July (Q3)
• Architecture & tech-stack finalization: 15 July
• UI/UX prototype: 15 August
• Alpha build (core KPI tracking + dashboards): 30 September
• Beta build (full HRIS integration + alerting): 30 November
• Pilot launch with 50 users: 02 January
• Pilot feedback & refinements: Jan–Mar
• Production rollout to all users: 15 April

5. Deliverables & Responsibilities
SoftSync Systems
• System architecture document
• Security & compliance plan (SOC 2 alignment)
• Front-end component library & style guide
• Back-end microservice codebase & deployment scripts
• End-user documentation & admin guide

Acme Corp (our team)
• Timely access to HRIS API credentials and documentation
• SME availability for weekly requirement clarifications
• Pilot user list & feedback coordination

6. Next Steps
Please review the above and let me know:
• Any adjustments you’d like to make to the timeline or deliverables.
• Resource assignments on your side (tech lead, UX lead, QA point of contact).
• Preferred cadence for sprint reviews and status reporting.

If feasible, I’d like to lock the scope and timeline by the end of this week so we can proceed with sprint zero preparations.

Thanks for your partnership, and looking forward to a successful kick-off!

Best regards,
