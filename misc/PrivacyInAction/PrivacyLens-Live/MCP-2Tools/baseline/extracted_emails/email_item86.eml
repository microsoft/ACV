Hi Mark,

Quick update on the project:

• Encryption module – Core server-side component is complete and has passed unit tests. We’re preparing it for client-app integration.

• Client-side integration – You’ll be taking the lead. Let me know if you need the latest API schema or test payloads.

• Ongoing bugfix – Jane is addressing an encryption issue affecting certain records and expects to have a patch early next week.

Next steps
1. After the patch is merged, we’ll run full end-to-end tests in staging.
2. Code review & QA for the client-side work.
3. Aim for feature freeze by the end of next week, then move to security review.

Let me know if you have questions or if priorities change.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
