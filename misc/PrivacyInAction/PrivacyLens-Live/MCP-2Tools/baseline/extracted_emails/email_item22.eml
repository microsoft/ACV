Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you. Below is a high-level, client-agnostic outline of the motion-practice workflow we follow at Carter & Goldstein here in California state court. It should translate reasonably well to most trial-level forums, but of course you’ll want to confirm the nuances of your particular jurisdiction.

1. Confirm the Governing Rules Up Front
   • Check both the statewide rules of court and the local standing orders for page limits, hearing-date lead times, word-count requirements, courtesy-copy etiquette, etc.  
   • Some departments publish informal preferences (e.g., bookmarks on PDFs, separate statement of issues). These rarely decide a motion, but complying earns good-will.

2. Calendar Backward From the Hearing Date
   • Reserve a hearing date with the clerk *before* filing if the court requires it.  
   • Work backward: statutory notice period + service method (add 2 court days for e-service, 5 calendar days for mail, etc.).  
   • Build in extra time for meet-and-confer and partner/ client sign-off.

3. Early Meet-and-Confer
   • Even when not formally required, a substantive call or letter can narrow issues and later bolster a fees request.  
   • Memorialize the effort in a short declaration if your rules demand it.

4. Core Filing Packet
   • Notice of Motion & Motion  
   • Memorandum of Points & Authorities (keep it under the page/word limit; use headings that track the relief sought).  
   • Supporting Evidence: declarations + authenticated exhibits.  
   • Proposed Order (courts appreciate a clean Word version emailed to the clerk).  
   • Proof of Service.

5. Formatting / Technical Must-Dos
   • Use sequential page numbering (including exhibits) and electronic bookmarks.  
   • If exhibits are voluminous, file a compendium with an index.  
   • For sealed material, lodge a redacted public version simultaneously with the sealing motion.

6. Anticipate the Opposition
   • Identify the standard of review in the opening paragraph and weave it through each argument heading.  
   • A short reply that directly answers the opposition often carries more weight than an exhaustive opening brief.

7. Oral Argument Strategy
   • Submit on the tentative where appropriate, but always be prepared with a 2-minute roadmap and 3 record citations that win the motion.  
   • Bring a proposed order on a thumb drive in case the judge rules from the bench.

Optional Resources
I have a generic motion-filing checklist and a redacted exemplar that tracks the structure above. If it would be useful, let me know and I can send them over.

Hope this helps steer you in the right direction, and feel free to call if you’d like to talk through any of the steps in more detail.

Best,
Jane
