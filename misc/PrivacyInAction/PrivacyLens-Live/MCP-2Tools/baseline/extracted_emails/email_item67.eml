Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope you are well. As requested, please find below a concise summary of our department’s current compliance position with respect to the latest international-student regulations and related institutional requirements.

1. Policy Review and Alignment
• We completed a line-by-line review of the most recent policy updates (spring 2025 bulletin) covering enrollment thresholds, on-campus employment, CPT/OPT reporting and document retention.
• Our internal checklist shows that all departmental procedures now fully align with the revised guidance and no gaps have been identified.

2. Faculty & Staff Awareness
• Following the compliance meeting (see notes dated 19 May 2025), we briefed all advisors and program coordinators on the new rules and distributed a one-page reference sheet. 100 % of staff have confirmed that they have read the material.

3. Student Record Monitoring
• A bi-weekly SEVIS audit routine has been instituted to flag credit-hour or status anomalies; all spring-semester student records were brought into conformance by 15 May.

4. Visa & Status Support
• We met with students facing imminent visa renewals to outline required steps and timelines, and we continue to liaise with the International Student Services Office to resolve individual challenges.

5. Ongoing Controls
• A shared compliance calendar with automatic reminders is now active, and the next internal audit is scheduled for August 2025.

Overall, the department is in full compliance at this time, and no corrective actions are outstanding.

Please let me know if you would like any additional detail or supporting documentation.
