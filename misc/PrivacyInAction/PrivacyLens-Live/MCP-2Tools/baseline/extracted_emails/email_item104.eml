Hi Mark,

It was a pleasure meeting you at the conference as well. I’m happy to share an overview of the key elements that shape our university’s approach to boosting student performance. While every campus has its own culture, these practices have proven consistently effective for us:

1. Proactive, data-informed early-alert system
   • Each week our learning-analytics platform scans LMS log-ins, assignment scores, and attendance records.  
   • Faculty can also flag concerns directly from their gradebook.  
   • When a risk signal appears, a success coach automatically schedules an outreach within 48 hours.

2. Individualized success plans
   • Students who trigger alerts meet with a dedicated academic-success advisor to co-create a written plan that includes academic, personal, and career goals.  
   • Action items might include study-skills workshops, tutoring appointments, or counseling services.

3. Tutoring & supplemental instruction at scale
   • Free, drop-in tutoring centers in STEM, writing, and business courses operate 60+ hours per week.  
   • “Supplemental Instruction” leaders—upper-level peers who previously earned an A—run weekly review sessions tied to historically challenging courses.

4. Just-in-time skill workshops
   • Short modules on time management, metacognition, and critical reading are embedded directly inside gateway courses, so students pick up strategies precisely when they need them.

5. Faculty development for inclusive teaching
   • Semester-long learning communities help instructors redesign courses around active learning, universal design, and transparent assignment criteria.  
   • Courses that participate have shown a 6-8 percentage-point bump in pass rates over the last three years.

6. Coordinated care network
   • Academic advising, financial-aid counselors, and mental-health clinicians share a single case-management platform (with appropriate permissions) so the student only tells their story once and support stays seamless.

7. Continuous assessment & iteration
   • The Institutional Research office pairs each intervention with defined success metrics (e.g., DFW rate, retention term-to-term) and runs quarterly reviews to refine or sunset programs that aren’t delivering impact.

Key lessons we’ve learned along the way:
• Fast feedback beats perfect prediction—acting on modest risk signals early prevents most crises.  
• Peer-to-peer support scales better than a purely staff-driven model.  
• Faculty buy-in is essential; presenting assessment data in a transparent, non-judgmental way helps.

I hope this snapshot is useful. I’d be glad to dive deeper into any of these practices or share sample dashboards/policies if helpful—just let me know.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
