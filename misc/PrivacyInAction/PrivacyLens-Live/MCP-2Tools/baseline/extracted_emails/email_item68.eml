Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share a quick overview of this year’s admissions cycle:

• Applications were up 5%, with roughly 15,000 students applying.
• With the larger pool, our acceptance rate decreased to 7%, bringing in an incoming class of about 1,050 exceptional students.
• The academic profile remains very strong – the average SAT is 1480 and the average ACT is 33.
• We continue to broaden our global reach; the class represents students from more than 60 countries, making this one of our most internationally diverse cohorts yet.

Everyone’s excited about the talent and energy this group will bring to campus. Orientation planning is already underway, and I’ll keep you posted on opportunities for alumni to connect with the newest members of the Prestige community.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like any additional details.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
