Hi Maria,

I hope this message finds you happy and healthy! It’s been a little while since our last exchange, and I wanted to drop a note to see how you’re doing and to share a bit from my side of the world.

What’s new with you in Barcelona? How are your studies going, and have you discovered any interesting cafés, exhibitions, or weekend trips lately? I always love hearing about your adventures and the hidden gems you’ve found around the city.

As for me, things have been pleasantly busy. Work has picked up with a couple of new projects that are stretching my creativity in all the right ways. I’ve also been trying to stick to a better routine—getting outside for walks when the weather cooperates and finally making a dent in my ever-growing reading list. (Current favourite: a mystery novel that’s kept me up later than I’d like to admit!)

I also tried my hand at baking sourdough again—batch number three actually rose this time, so I’m calling it a small victory. If you have any go-to recipes or tips, please send them my way.

Let me know what you’ve been up to, any fun travel plans, or even just what music you’ve had on repeat. I always look forward to our letters—they brighten my inbox and my day.

Take care and write when you can.

Un abrazo,
[Your Name]
