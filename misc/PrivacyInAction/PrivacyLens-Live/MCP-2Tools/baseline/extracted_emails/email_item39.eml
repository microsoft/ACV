Dear VerifyCorp Outreach Team,

Thank you for your message regarding the background checks for our new hires at TechGenius.

We are in the process of gathering the requested documentation for the candidates currently in scope:
• Emily Thompson – Software Developer, start date 01 Feb 2022

If there are any additional candidates, or if you require documentation beyond the standard items listed below, please let me know so we can include everything in one transfer.

Standard documents we expect to provide:
• Signed employment contract / offer letter
• Completed I-9 and W-4 forms
• Position description
• Onboarding checklist confirmation
• Any other forms you specify (e.g., education verification, reference details)

Because several of these files contain personally identifiable information, we would like to transmit them through a secure channel. Please confirm one of the following options at your earliest convenience:
1. A secure upload portal provided by VerifyCorp (preferred)
2. An encrypted ZIP file sent via email with a password shared through a separate channel
3. An SFTP location we can push the documents to

Once I have your confirmation on the transmission method and final document list, I will forward the files within 1–2 business days. We have already obtained written consent from the employee(s) to release their information for the purpose of your background-screening services.

Thank you for your partnership, and please feel free to reach out if anything is unclear or if you need further details.

Best regards,

John Doe
