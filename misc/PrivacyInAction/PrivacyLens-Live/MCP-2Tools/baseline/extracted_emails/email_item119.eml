Hi Mary,

Thank you for sending over the first round of concepts—they look great! Below is the final brief with the color palettes, imagery, and style references the authors and I agreed on after our last review session.

────────────────────────
1. "Whispers of the Ancients"
────────────────────────
• Core Mood: Mysterious, timeless, faintly cosmic.
• Primary Palette:  
  – Deep Indigo (#152042) background  
  – Antique Gold (#C9A35A) accents  
  – Soft Sandstone (#DBCFB4) for subtle highlights.
• Key Imagery: Weather-worn stone ruins in the foreground that merge into a star-filled sky. A faint constellation line connecting the ruins to the heavens subtly reinforces the "whispers" theme.
• Style Note: Semi-realistic illustration with a slight watercolor wash and visible brush textures so the piece feels aged rather than glossy.

────────────────────────
2. "The Last Alchemist"
────────────────────────
• Core Mood: Esoteric, dangerous knowledge, Renaissance intrigue.
• Primary Palette:  
  – Dark Emerald (#0F3C32) base  
  – Metallic Aged Gold (#9C8855) for symbols  
  – Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) shadows.
• Key Imagery: Central alchemical circle (think Flamel diagram) glowing faintly; a cloaked figure in ¾ silhouette stands before it holding an open tome. Scatter a few alchemical glyphs around the circle to hint at transformation.
• Style Note: Detailed line work with engraved-print touches, then overlaid with subtle texture so it feels like an old parchment etching that was newly illuminated.

────────────────────────
3. "A Dance of Shadows"
────────────────────────
• Core Mood: Passion, peril, elegance amid conflict.
• Primary Palette:  
  – Rich Crimson (#750202) foreground shapes  
  – Smoked Gray (#4B4B4B) midtones  
  – Warm Amber (#F1B15A) highlights from firelight.
• Key Imagery: Interlocking silhouettes of two dancers encircling a bonfire; their elongated shadows stretch outward and subtly morph into sword shapes, hinting at the looming war.
• Style Note: Strong graphic silhouettes against gradients; light grain texture to keep the piece organic and avoid a flat vector feel.

Global Details & Specs
────────────────────────
• Trim Size: 6 × 9 inches (bleed 0.125 in on all sides).
• Resolution: 300 dpi CMYK for print; RGB 72 dpi for marketing thumbnails.
• Formats: Print-ready PDF + layered PSD (or .ai) with text on separate layer to accommodate late copy-edits.
• Typography: Please leave title and author text as editable smart objects. The team is leaning toward a Trajan-style serif for titles and a crisp humanist sans-serif for subtitles/author lines.
• Timeline: If possible, could we receive the next round of polished comps by 15 March? Final approved covers would need to go to the printer by 5 April.

Reference Folder: I've shared a Google Drive folder named "TEC Cover Refs" that includes rough sketches, sample textures, and color chips for each palette.

Let me know if anything here needs clarification or if you foresee any issues with the schedule.

Thanks again, and excited to see what you create!

Best,
John
