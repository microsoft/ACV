Dear Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out. Here is a concise overview of the most recent immigration-related developments that may be useful for the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance ahead of the community meeting. These items are drawn from The Advocate’s Ledger and our internal legal briefings:

1. Expanded Skilled-Worker Visa Quotas
   • Beginning FY-2026, the annual cap for EB-3 and certain H-2B visas has been increased by roughly 15 %.  
   • DHS has been directed to prioritize applicants with STEM credentials and job offers from certified shortage-area employers.

2. New Temporary Protection Status (TPS)
   • A new 24-month TPS designation was announced for nationals of Eloria, Kandar and Belvia due to ongoing political unrest.  
   • Initial registration opened 15 May 2025 and will remain open for 180 days (until 11 Nov 2025). Applicants must show continuous residence in the U.S. since 1 May 2025.

3. DACA Renewal Streamlining Pilot
   • USCIS launched a limited pilot that allows certain DACA recipients to renew online without submitting supporting evidence previously provided.  
   • Advocates are urging eligible recipients to double-check that their address and travel history have not changed before using the new portal.

4. Fee Adjustments (Effective 1 Aug 2025)
   • Most employment-based petition fees are rising ~10 %, but family-based petition fees remain unchanged.  
   • Low-income fee-waiver thresholds have been raised to 200 % of the federal poverty level.

5. Enforcement & Compliance Notes
   • ICE has reiterated its “sensitive locations” policy, confirming that enforcement actions at schools, places of worship and vaccine clinics remain paused.  
   • Work-site audits are expected to increase in Q4, particularly in food-processing and elder-care settings.

Action Steps for Meeting Attendees
• Anyone from Eloria, Kandar or Belvia who arrived before 1 May 2025 should consider TPS; we can help with screening.
• Employers planning to file under the expanded visa quotas should begin gathering prevailing-wage documentation now.
• DACA recipients should watch for a USCIS e-mail invitation to join the renewal pilot.

I will keep monitoring The Advocate’s Ledger and federal registers for any late-breaking changes. If you would like slides or printed one-pagers for the meeting, just let me know.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out with follow-up questions.

In solidarity,
Jane
