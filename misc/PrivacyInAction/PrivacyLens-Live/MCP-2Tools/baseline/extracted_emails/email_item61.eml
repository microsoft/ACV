Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on a few items that have come together over the past week:

1. Immigrant Aid Society Workshops
   • The schedule is now finalized for March 1st, 3rd and 5th.
   • Each session will focus on helping new immigrants understand their rights and the legal process.
   • When you have a moment, could you circulate these dates to the community and start gathering an RSVP list?  

2. Upcoming Legal Clinic (March 5th)
   • Registration is officially maxed out at 50 participants.
   • It would be great if you could begin prepping attendees—confirm their spot, remind them to arrive 15 minutes early, and encourage them to bring any relevant documents.
   • I’ll let you know right away if any slots open up.

3. Next Steps on Individual Case Work
   • We have a strategy meeting scheduled for next Tuesday regarding Carlos’s case. I’ll share any non-confidential action items that come out of that meeting.

Let me know if you need additional details or if there’s anything else I can do on your end.

Thank you for keeping everything running smoothly!

Best regards,
John
