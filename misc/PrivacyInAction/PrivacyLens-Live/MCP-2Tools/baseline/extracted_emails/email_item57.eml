Hi Tom,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to give you a brief update on how our community is doing and share some of Path to Sobriety’s latest activities.

Community Snapshot (past month)
• Weekly support-group attendance is up 20 %, reflecting growing community engagement.
• Twelve new participants have begun formal rehabilitation with our guidance.
• Biggest current needs we’re seeing: transportation assistance for appointments and evening child-care so more parents can attend meetings.

Recent Path to Sobriety Highlights
• Outreach team connected with 45 individuals, providing resources and initial counseling.
• Hosted three substance-abuse awareness & prevention workshops in collaboration with the local library.
• Planning two follow-up sessions in early June (résumé-building and stress-management) to help participants strengthen life skills.

How Hope and Recovery Network Could Help
• Transit passes & child-care stipends (approx. $600/month) would remove key barriers for many participants.
• Referrals to volunteer mental-health professionals for one-on-one sessions.
• Sharing our June workshop schedule across your network to broaden our reach.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional details or data. We value your partnership and appreciate all you do for our community.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
Program Coordinator | Path to Sobriety
