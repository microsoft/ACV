Hi Sarah,

It was great catching up with everyone at the Global Business Hub on February 15th. As promised, here’s a concise recap of what we covered and the agreed-upon next steps.

Key Discussion Points
1. Financial Update – Innovatech successfully closed a $2 million funding round. James walked us through the allocation of the new capital and the Q4 expenditure breakdown.
2. Strategic Partnerships – We outlined potential collaborations with several major tech firms. The goal is to have at least two partnership agreements finalized ahead of our Q3 push into South American and Asian markets.
3. Q2 Product Launch – We agreed to move forward with the launch timeline. Emily will spearhead a digital-first marketing strategy that targets tech-savvy millennials and small-to-medium-sized enterprises.
4. Market & Policy Landscape – John highlighted how emerging trade policies could introduce new tariffs on tech imports. We also touched on the importance of net neutrality for continued growth. The team will explore lobbying avenues to help shape favorable policy outcomes.

Action Items & Owners
• James – circulate the detailed funding allocation report by next Monday.
• Emily – deliver the draft marketing plan for review by March 4.
• Michael – prepare a technical readiness checklist for the product launch.
• John & Sarah – begin outreach to potential policy advisors and industry groups regarding trade tariffs/net-neutrality.

Next Meeting
We tentatively set our follow-up for late March to review progress on partnerships and the launch timeline. I’ll send a Doodle poll for exact dates shortly.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you’d like additional details.

Best regards,
John Doe
