Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to give you a brief update on the folks we’re both supporting.

• Michael has wrapped up the advanced welding portion of the New Horizons Job Training Program and earned excellent marks. He’s already lined up a few interviews and feels confident about securing a position soon. He’s also been practicing more disciplined budgeting and reports that he’s steadily building up savings each month—great to see his confidence growing on multiple fronts.

• The broader community-support effort is also moving along nicely. Your coordination of extra volunteers from Unity Church has made our recent events run smoothly and has been a big morale boost. Thank you!

I’ll keep you posted as soon as there are any significant developments—or if any additional needs arise that Unity Church might be able to help with.

Thanks again for being such an encouraging presence.

Best,

[Your Name]
