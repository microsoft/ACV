Hi Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’re doing well and that everything on your end is going smoothly.

I wanted to share a brief update on what I’ve been working on lately. I’ve been leading an architectural package for a major international terminal expansion. The project involves re-imagining passenger flow, adding new gate capacity, and integrating more sustainable building systems, all while coordinating closely with operations, commercial stakeholders, and security teams. We’re now moving from concept into detailed design and I’m refining the overall layout, material selections, and risk-mitigation strategies.

Given your guidance during my time at the firm, I’d really value any thoughts you might have—particularly on how to balance long-term adaptability with the immediate operational requirements that come with large transportation hubs.

If you have a few minutes in the coming weeks, I’d love to set up a quick call or simply trade emails to pick your brain.

Thanks so much and looking forward to hearing how you’ve been.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
