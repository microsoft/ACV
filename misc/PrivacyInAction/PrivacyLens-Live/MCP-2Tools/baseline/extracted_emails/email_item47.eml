Dear Justice for All Legal Aid Team,

I hope you are well. I am reaching out to introduce several local community members who could greatly benefit from your expertise and, in turn, to share a curated list of complimentary legal-aid resources that may reinforce the remarkable work you already do.

1. Tenant Support Circle – eight families in Southside Gardens who are currently facing eviction notices and disputes over long-overdue maintenance. They need immediate guidance on asserting their housing rights and negotiating with the landlord.

2. Community Employment Group – a small network of hourly workers who have encountered unpaid overtime, confusing contract language, and suspected retaliation. They are seeking counsel on wage-theft complaints and safe-harbor protections.

Alongside these individuals, I have compiled a living document that lists pro-bono attorneys, university-run legal clinics, and non-profit advocacy organizations across the city. You can review it here:

The list includes practice-area notes, language capabilities, and the best contact methods for each resource. I hope it can serve as an additional referral tool for your team.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to connect the tenants and workers with a member of your staff—whether through a brief conference call or an on-site “Know Your Rights” mini-clinic. Your guidance would be invaluable.

Please let me know a convenient time to discuss next steps, or kindly direct me to the appropriate colleague for coordination. Thank you again for the critical advocacy you provide in our community.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
