Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in TelNet Communications. I’m delighted to give you an overview of how we can support your business as a reliable and scalable telecommunications partner.

1. Core Services
• High-Speed Internet – Symmetrical fiber connections from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps with 99.99 % uptime backed by an SLA.
• VoIP & Unified Communications – Cloud-based voice, video and messaging with unlimited nationwide calling, advanced call-routing and MS Teams & Webex integrations.
• Managed IT & Network Security – 24/7 monitoring, firewall management, SD-WAN and on-site support so your team can focus on core operations.
• Mobile & Fixed-Line Telephony – Competitive corporate mobile bundles plus SIP trunking for your existing PBX or call-center platform.

2. Scalability & Reliability
All of our services sit on a fully redundant, Tier-III carrier-grade network. Bandwidth can be upgraded on-demand within hours and our cloud voice seats scale from 5 to 5,000 with no hardware change. Each business customer is assigned a dedicated account manager and has access to our 24/7 NOC.

3. Pricing Model
We keep pricing transparent with three standard tiers (Essentials, Growth and Enterprise) and à-la-carte add-ons. Most new clients start on the Growth bundle at $29/seat for VoIP and $3.25/Mbps for fiber, with a one-time activation fee of $199 that we often waive for 3-year terms. I’m happy to build a tailored quote once I know your exact site count and traffic profile.

4. Customer Success Snapshot
• Acme Logistics (multi-site distributor) migrated 12 warehouses to TelNet SD-WAN + VoIP in 2023, cutting telecom spend 18 % while improving call quality and achieving 100 % uptime during peak season.
• GreenLeaf Health Clinics consolidated 28 disparate phone systems onto our cloud UC platform; patient call-handling time dropped 22 % and the IT team recovered 12 hrs/week previously spent on legacy PBX maintenance.

5. Next Steps
If you can share a quick outline of your locations, user counts and any upcoming projects, I can prepare a proposal and cost estimate within 48 hours. I’d also be glad to arrange a 30-minute demo or connect you with an existing client in your industry for a reference call.

Thank you again for considering TelNet Communications. Please let me know a convenient time for a brief call or feel free to reply with any initial questions.

Best regards,
