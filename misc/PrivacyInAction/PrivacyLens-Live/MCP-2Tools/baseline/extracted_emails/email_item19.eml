Dear Mrs. Thompson,

I hope you’re doing well. Per your request, I wanted to share a current update on Timmy’s health so you have the most accurate information on file at the health office.

• Asthma management – Timmy’s pediatrician recently reviewed his asthma and slightly adjusted his daily inhaled corticosteroid dosage. He is responding well, with no wheezing or nighttime coughing for the past four weeks. His rescue inhaler (albuterol) should still accompany him to school and be readily available before PE or recess if needed.

• Recent illness – Timmy has fully recovered from the bout of pneumonia he had earlier in the winter. A follow-up chest X-ray was clear and the doctor has cleared him for normal activities.

• Triggers to watch – Please continue to help him avoid strong fragrances, dust, and outdoor allergens on high-pollen days. If you notice any coughing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath, please have him use his rescue inhaler and call me.

• Action plan – I’ve attached (*or have on file in the office*) the updated Asthma Action Plan that outlines step-by-step instructions. Let me know if you need another hard copy and I can send one in with Timmy tomorrow.

Next appointment – Timmy’s next routine check-up with the pulmonologist is scheduled for June 6. I’ll share any new information after that visit.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there’s anything else you need.

Thank you for helping keep Timmy safe and healthy at school.

Warm regards,
