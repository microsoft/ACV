Hello Alex,

Thank you for considering me for the Lead Developer position at InnovateX. I remain very excited about the prospect of joining the team and contributing my experience in building scalable products and leading high-performing engineering groups.

After researching current market rates for senior engineering leadership roles, as well as reflecting on my 10+ years of experience spearheading successful product launches and cloud-migration initiatives, I believe a total compensation package in the following range is appropriate:

• Base salary: $145,000 – $155,000 per year  
• Performance-based bonus: ~10% of base  
• Equity: meaningful equity participation to align long-term incentives

I am, of course, open to discussing the structure in more detail to ensure it aligns with InnovateX’s compensation framework and the specific responsibilities of the role. My goal is to arrive at a package that reflects the value I can bring while supporting the company’s objectives and budget.

Please let me know if this range fits within InnovateX’s expectations or if you would like to schedule a call to talk through the details further.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. I look forward to the next steps in the process.

Best regards,

John Doe
