Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to share a few Greenfield University alumni highlights that might resonate with Bright Futures’ readership.

1. Marcus Antonelli (Class of 2021 – Business & Community Leadership)
   • Recently delivered the keynote address at our “Alumni Making a Difference” forum, speaking about resilience and community service.
   • Active volunteer: mentors first-generation students and partners with local non-profits to run financial-literacy workshops.

2. Community Impact & Volunteerism
   • Over the past year, alumni collectively contributed more than 2,000 volunteer hours to causes ranging from STEM tutoring to neighborhood revitalization projects.
   • A new Alumni Service Corps pairs recent graduates with local NGOs for six-month fellowships; the inaugural cohort has already supported three food-security initiatives in the region.

3. Recent Alumni Events
   • “Voices of Greenfield” Speaker Series — quarterly talks featuring alumni in public service, entrepreneurship, and the arts.
   • Annual Day of Service — more than 300 alumni participated across 12 cities this spring.

Please let me know if you’d like additional details, quotes, or images, and I’ll be glad to coordinate. We’re excited to collaborate and celebrate the positive impact our graduates are making.

Best regards,
