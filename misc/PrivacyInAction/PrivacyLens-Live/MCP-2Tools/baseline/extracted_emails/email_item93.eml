Dear ConstructCo Solutions Team,

I hope you’re all doing well.

I’m excited to officially get our new project under way and would like to outline the immediate next steps so we can hit the ground running:

1. Kick-off Meeting
   • Proposed Date/Time: Tuesday, 28 February at 10:00 AM EST (please let me know if this slot works for you).
   • Agenda: review project goals and scope, confirm key milestones and deliverables, and establish our communication cadence.

2. Project Materials
   • I have attached the current draft project timeline and the latest material-specification sheet for your review.
   • Please take a moment to look them over and flag any questions or updates.

3. Points of Contact
   • Primary Contact (ConstructCo): <please confirm>
   • Primary Contact (our side): Jane Doe – janedoe@example.com
   • Day-to-day coordination: Iona Smith – iona.smith@example.com

Next Steps
   • Once we confirm the kick-off meeting, we can finalise the timeline and issue a consolidated action list.
   • If you need any additional information ahead of the meeting, just let me know.

We’re looking forward to a successful collaboration and are eager to get started.

Thank you and speak soon!

Best regards,
Jane Doe
