Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the two patients we discussed who could really benefit from Helping Hands’ services.

1. Mrs. Linda Smith – Post-operative hip-replacement patient
   • Need: Transportation to and from outpatient physical-therapy sessions (3 times per week, Mon/Wed/Fri at 10 a.m.)
   • Status: Her daughter can manage most household tasks but is unable to drive during weekday mornings. First PT session is next Monday, 24 Feb.

2. Mr. George Brown – 78-year-old widower
   • Need: Regular companionship / friendly-visitor check-ins to address social isolation
   • Status: Lives alone in Oakwood Apartments, Apt 3B. Afternoons (1–4 p.m.) work best for him. He enjoys chess and short neighborhood walks.

Both patients have expressed enthusiasm about connecting with Helping Hands volunteers. Please let me know:
• If you have volunteers available for Linda’s transportation starting next week.
• Whether we can pair George with someone who could visit once or twice weekly.

I’m happy to provide any additional medical or logistical information you might need to expedite the match process.

Thanks for everything you and your team do!

Best regards,
