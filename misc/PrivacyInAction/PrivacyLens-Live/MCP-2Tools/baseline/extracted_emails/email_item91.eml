Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise snapshot of where we stand on our two active community-facing projects:

1. HEAP (Health Empowerment and Awareness Program)
   • Content: Drafted the core workshop curriculum and brochure copy based on the health-literacy framework we agreed on.
   • Partnerships: Outreach team is lining up two community centers as host venues; confirmation expected by early next week.
   • Next step: Finalize the workshop schedule and send it to comms for design/layout.

2. Vax4All Initiative
   • Logistics: Tentative approval for three pop-up vaccination sites in Oakwood Village (rec center, library, and farmers’ market).
   • Outreach: Messaging plan outlines social posts, flyers, and a short video; comms will start producing assets once dates are locked.
   • Next step: Coordinate with providers to confirm onsite clinical staff and cold-chain requirements.

Key dates coming up
• Friday, 26 May – Internal review of HEAP workshop materials.
• Tuesday, 30 May – Final site walk-through for Vax4All.

Let me know if you see any gaps or have additional updates. Happy to sync later this week if needed.

Thanks!
