Dear Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to share an exciting new literacy initiative we’re launching called “Read to Succeed,” and to explore ways Helping Hands might like to be involved.

About the program
• Audience: Children ages 6–10 in our local community
• Goal: Strengthen foundational reading skills and spark a lifelong love of books
• Format: Weekly themed reading sessions led by trained volunteers, complemented by take-home book bundles and interactive activities
• Expected reach: 150+ children in the first year, with capacity to scale as resources allow

Why it matters
Research shows that early reading proficiency is one of the strongest predictors of long-term academic success. By pairing engaging content with consistent mentorship, “Read to Succeed” gives young learners the tools and confidence they need to thrive.

How Helping Hands can partner with us
We’re currently securing support for:
1. High-quality reading materials (print and digital)
2. Volunteer recruitment and training
3. Community outreach and promotional events

Your organization’s experience empowering youth makes Helping Hands a natural collaborator. Whether through in-kind donations, volunteer engagement, or sponsorship, your involvement would directly expand the program’s impact.

Next steps
I’d love to schedule a brief call next week to walk you through the program outline and discuss potential synergies. Please let me know a time that works for you, or feel free to suggest another window.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to invest in young readers. I look forward to the possibility of working together.
