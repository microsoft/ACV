Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I have indeed spent quite a bit of time on the SkyHigh Tower foundation model, so I’m happy to share what I learned.

Below is a quick summary of the points that proved most critical in our analysis:

1. Soil–structure interaction
   • We calibrated the sub-grade modulus using pressuremeter data and iteration until settlement results matched field tests.
   • The final value we used was 25 MN/m³, which reduced overstated corner settlements by roughly 18 %.

2. Load combinations & factors
   • Ultimate‐limit design was done per ACI 318-19 (1.2D + 1.6L + 0.5W etc.).
   • Service-level settlement criteria we adopted were: total ≤ 25 mm, differential ≤ 19 mm over any 10 m.

3. Pile group / mat option
   • If you move toward a piled-raft solution, Group Efficiency ≈ 0.75 addressed shadowing effects for battered piles.
   • For a pure mat, punching shear governed at the tower core—extra 150 mm of localized thickening solved it.

4. Lateral (wind & seismic) coupling into the foundation
   • We tied the core wall and perimeter columns into a common mat stub to avoid drift concentration.
   • Adding a 600 mm shear key between the mat and core walls dropped the rocking moment 12 %.

I’ve put the more detailed notes, charts, and the STAAD model walkthrough in our internal page “SkyHigh Tower Structural Analysis.” If that would help, let me know and I can send across the PDF or jump on a quick call to walk you through it.

Does Thursday afternoon or Friday morning work for a 30-minute meeting?

Hope this speeds things up for you.

Best regards,
