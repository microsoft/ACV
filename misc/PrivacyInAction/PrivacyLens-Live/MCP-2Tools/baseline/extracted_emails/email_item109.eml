Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you, and thanks for reaching out about the UI project.

Below are a few high-level engagement insights we’ve gathered from recent analytics that might help steer your design decisions:

• Average session duration is up about 15 % over the past quarter, suggesting users are spending more time exploring the platform.
• The new step-by-step onboarding tutorial we launched in March has improved first-week retention by roughly 20 %.
• After logging in, users most frequently navigate to the “Account Settings” and “Security” sections. Those areas account for nearly a third of total clicks on the main dashboard.

I’ve got some additional anonymized data on navigation flows and feature adoption that I can walk you through if that would be helpful. Let me know if you’d like to set up a quick call or screenshare later this week.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
Jane
