Dear HealthTech Innovations Team,

I hope you are well. Based on our recent conversations and the internal project outline, I am sharing the key requirements and upcoming milestones to guide development of the Health Tracking System.

1. Functional Scope
• Track core health metrics—heart rate, step count, and sleep patterns—with future support for nutrition and mental-wellness modules.
• Cross-platform mobile apps (iOS & Android) plus a web dashboard for health officers.
• Real-time data synchronisation across users and devices.
• Customisable report generation and analytics.

2. Data Privacy & Security
• Full HIPAA compliance.
• AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit.
• Multi-factor authentication for all users with access to sensitive records.
• Quarterly independent security audits.
• Built-in anonymisation tools for de-identified reporting.

3. High-Level Milestones
• System design sign-off: mid-March.
• Prototype available for internal testing: early June.
• Integration & module compatibility testing completed: late February.
• Final implementation & rollout: late September.

Please let me know if you foresee any challenges with the above timeline or require additional resources. I would also like to schedule a call next week to review progress on module compatibility testing and QA feedback—kindly share your availability.

Thank you for your ongoing collaboration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
