Hi Sarah,

I wanted to follow-up regarding the patient we discussed and his potential enrollment in the HealFast program.

• Based on the information in our records, the patient has successfully completed more than six months in the Path to Wellness program and has demonstrated steady improvement in the tracked health metrics over that period.
• Those two factors satisfy the core enrollment criteria laid out for HealFast.
• We have verified that there are no contraindications noted by the patient’s care team and that all HIPAA consents remain current on our side.

Therefore, from our perspective the patient meets the eligibility requirements and can move forward with HealFast as soon as you give the green light.

Please let me know if your underwriting or clinical review team needs any additional documentation (progress summaries, lab values, etc.). I can have those securely transmitted right away.

Thanks, and let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Care Coordinator
