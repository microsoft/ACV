Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to share a quick status update on our ongoing project:

1. Traffic Flow Data – Q1 Analysis
• The full Heathrow traffic-flow dataset for the last quarter has been compiled and forwarded to you last week. 
• I’ve begun running the first round of analyses and have already mapped the major bottlenecks. Early indications suggest several opportunities to improve throughput on the West Apron stands and Pier 4 taxi lanes.
• This week I’ll be integrating these findings into our efficiency-prediction models. I should have a draft set of metrics and visualisations ready for us to review by mid-next week.

2. Security System Upgrade
• The new facial-recognition software has been installed on SRV-192 and initial tests show roughly a 15 % increase in identification accuracy compared with the previous build.
• All services are stable and no abnormal latency has been observed so far. I’ll continue to monitor performance over the next few days and run a stress-test during the low-traffic window on Friday night.

Next Steps
• I’d like to set up a quick 30-minute call early next week (Mon or Tue) to walk you through the preliminary results, discuss any additional variables you’d like included, and outline the write-up schedule for our paper.
• Let me know which time works best for you and if there’s anything you’d like me to dig into before the call.

Thanks, and speak soon!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
