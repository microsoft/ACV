Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out and for your concern about Eric.

Eric has provided HR with the necessary documentation confirming that his recent absences are related to a medical matter. We are working with him to make sure he has the flexibility and support he needs while he focuses on his health, and we expect his attendance to stabilize in the coming weeks.

Because of confidentiality guidelines I’m not able to share additional medical details, but please be assured that the appropriate accommodations are in place. If you anticipate any workload or scheduling gaps on your end, let me know and we can coordinate an interim coverage plan.

Thank you for your understanding and for looking out for Eric. Feel free to reach out if there’s anything else you need.

Best regards,
Jane
