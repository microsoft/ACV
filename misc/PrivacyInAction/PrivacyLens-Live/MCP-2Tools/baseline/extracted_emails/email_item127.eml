Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you are doing well. I am currently working on a litigation matter that involves a contractual dispute and would greatly value your perspective.

In particular, I am evaluating strategies for challenging the credibility of opposing expert testimony and for streamlining certain discovery requests. Given your extensive experience with complex commercial matters, I believe your insights could help ensure we are approaching these issues from the most effective angle.

If you have time over the next week, could we arrange a brief call? Alternatively, I can send you a concise summary of the key questions to get your preliminary thoughts.

Thank you very much for your time and guidance. I look forward to reconnecting with you.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
