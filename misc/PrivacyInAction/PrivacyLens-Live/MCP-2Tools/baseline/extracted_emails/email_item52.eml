Dear Professor Smith,

I am writing on behalf of Emily Carter (ECON 401 – Advanced Economics) to explain a recent circumstance that has affected her academic performance and to request your understanding and flexibility.

On the evening of Sunday, May 18, Emily was the victim of an armed robbery near the campus library. Although she was physically unharmed, the event was highly traumatic. She has since been meeting with our university counseling service and is working through the resulting anxiety.

Unfortunately, the incident occurred the night before your mid-term exam. Emily made an attempt to sit the assessment, but her ability to concentrate was understandably compromised. She is concerned that her grade will not reflect her true mastery of the material.

We respectfully ask whether you would be willing to offer one of the following accommodations:
• Allow Emily to sit a make-up or re-take of the mid-term at a later date.
• Permit her to have the mid-term weight shifted to the final exam.
• Any alternative arrangement you feel is appropriate.

A formal letter from the counseling center can be provided should you require documentation.

Thank you very much for considering this request. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
