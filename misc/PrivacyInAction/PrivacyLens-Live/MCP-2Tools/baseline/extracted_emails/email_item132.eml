Hi Alex,

It’s great to hear from you, and I’m glad our brief chat about addiction recovery sparked your curiosity. Below is a quick snapshot of what we’re doing at Serenity Path and some ways we might collaborate.

What we do
-----------
• Mission-driven care: Serenity Path combines evidence-based therapies with a holistic, person-first philosophy. Our goal is to help individuals not only achieve sobriety but build sustainable, purpose-filled lives.

• Core programs:
  – Residential (30–90 day) track for those who need an immersive, medically-supervised environment.
  – Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) that blends group CBT sessions, individual counseling, and relapse-prevention skills three evenings a week—ideal for clients who need flexibility with work or school.
  – Family Systems track that brings partners, parents, and children into the therapeutic process.
  – After-care & alumni community: a virtual support app, weekly peer-led meetings, and volunteer mentorships for graduates.

• Results we’re proud of: Over the past 12 months, 75 % of our graduates have maintained sobriety at the 6-month checkpoint—well above the national average for comparable programs.

Resources & next steps
-----------------------
I’m attaching a PDF overview and slide deck that dives deeper into our clinical model, tech-enabled after-care, and research outcomes. (Let me know if a different format is easier.)

If you’d like to see things first-hand, we host a monthly “Innovation in Recovery” open house where we demo our digital tools and sit in on a mindfulness group. The next one is Thursday, March 10 at 4 p.m. You’d be more than welcome.

Potential collaboration ideas
• User-centric app feedback: Your background in software development could help us refine the UX of our alumni support app.
• Data dashboards: We’re exploring better ways to visualize real-time outcome metrics for clinicians—an area where your expertise might be invaluable.

Let me know what resonates or if you have other questions. Happy to set up a short call and explore possibilities.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation!

Warm regards,
John
