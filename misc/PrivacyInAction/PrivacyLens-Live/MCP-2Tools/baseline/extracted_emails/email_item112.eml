Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you! Below is a concise run-through of the items you asked about, pulled from the current TrustWell Bank procedures manual and the orientation pack.

1. Handling Customer Inquiries
• Verify identity – obtain at least two identifiers (government photo ID + account number, or ask a security question if remote). Note the verification steps in the CRM Contact Log.
• Capture the inquiry – enter a short description under Customer Contact → “Inquiry” and assign the correct category.
• Resolve or route – if it’s within your authority, solve the issue immediately and record the resolution. Otherwise, create a ticket for the responsible back-office team and give the customer an ETA.
• Confirm understanding – recap the answer or next steps with the customer.
• Close the interaction – mark the CRM record as “resolved” and select the final outcome code.

2. Issue-Reporting / Escalation Protocol
• Routine issues: email the Help Desk (internal-help@trustwellbank.com) with the CRM ticket number and a summary. Response SLA is four business hours.
• Urgent/high-risk matters (suspected fraud, large-value transaction errors, system outage): call your Regional Branch Manager first (numbers are in the Regional Managers Contact List) and then open a help-desk ticket.
• Compliance or security concerns: please CC compliance@trustwellbank.com in addition to the steps above.

3. Resources & Quick Links
• Bank Procedures Overview (Notion): https://www.notion.so/Bank-Procedures-Overview-1f70dc8fa0db81e59285f3e8e70a0e4a
• Orientation Handbook – Section 3 “Customer Service & Escalation” (PDF in your onboarding folder)
• Regional Managers Contact List (Notion)
• Help Desk: internal-help@trustwellbank.com | ext. 7711
• Slack: #procedures channel (Mon–Fri, 9 am–6 pm ET)

Let me know if you’d like to walk through any scenario in detail—I’m happy to jump on a quick call.

Welcome again, and thanks for being proactive!

Best,
Jane
