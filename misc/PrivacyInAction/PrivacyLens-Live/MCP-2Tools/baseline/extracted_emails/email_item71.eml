Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! Thank you for inviting me to share feedback on Bright Futures Foundation’s “Read to Succeed” initiative. After reviewing my students’ most recent work and class data, I’ve pulled together a few observations and ideas that might be useful as you plan the next phase:

1. Measurable growth
• Our average reading-comprehension score has risen by roughly 15 % since the program launched this semester. Students are also demonstrating stronger critical-thinking skills in their essays and discussions.

2. Remaining challenges
• Limited access to diverse, high-interest books: Several students rely solely on our classroom library, which restricts genre variety and reading levels.
• One-size-fits-all reading assignments: Some struggling readers still need more personalized guidance to stay engaged and make progress.

3. Suggestions for the next cycle
• Resource expansion: Consider a mini-grant or book-drive component so each participating classroom can add 30-50 new titles that represent different cultures, formats (graphic novels, audiobooks), and Lexile ranges.
• Personalized reading pathways: A simple reading-goal tracker or choice-board can let students select books that match their interests while ensuring they hit key literacy benchmarks.
• Community partnerships: Local libraries and independent bookstores are often eager to host "Read to Succeed" shelves or weekend reading circles—easy, low-cost ways to widen access.
• Mentorship & reflection: Pairing students with volunteer reading mentors (even virtually) and building in short reflection prompts after each book could deepen comprehension and accountability.

4. Data & storytelling support
I’m happy to share aggregate class data, sample reflection prompts, or draft a brief impact snapshot for your reports or grant applications—just let me know what would help.

Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss any of the points above or brainstorm further. Thanks again for the meaningful work Bright Futures is doing to nurture young readers!
