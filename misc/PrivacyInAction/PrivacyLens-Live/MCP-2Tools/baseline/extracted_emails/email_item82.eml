Dear Mr. Blackwood,

I hope you are doing well. My name is [Your Name], and I lead the strategic partnerships team at [Your Company]. Over the past few months we have been analysing potential high-impact collaborations with sector-leading investors, and your work at Blackwood Investments consistently stands out.

Our research shows that partnerships built around clear shared goals, full transparency and complementary capabilities can boost portfolio performance by as much as 20 percent. With your proven track record in identifying undervalued growth opportunities and our deep operational network in emerging technologies, there is strong alignment for creating outsized value together.

Specifically, we see three immediate areas where a joint effort could be mutually beneficial:
1. Co-investment in late-stage climate-tech start-ups where we already have proprietary deal flow.
2. Access to our data-driven diligence platform to accelerate your investment-decision timelines.
3. Collaborative thought-leadership (white papers, executive roundtables) that positions both of our firms as go-to partners for founders and LPs alike.

I would welcome the chance to discuss these ideas in more detail and learn more about your current objectives. Could we schedule a 30-minute call next week? I am available Tuesday (11 June) between 10:00–12:00 EST and Thursday (13 June) after 2:00 EST, but I am happy to adjust to your convenience.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
