Hi Sarah,

Great to hear from you! Below is a quick snapshot of our most recent donor-engagement metrics. I pulled these from our internal quarterly and annual reports so that you have the latest numbers while you map out the campaign timeline.

Q4 2021 highlights 
• Donor participation rose 15 % compared with Q3 (driven largely by our year-end holiday push). 
• Our targeted e-mail appeal to lapsed donors achieved a 20 % conversion rate.
• The matching-gift microsite accounted for 32 % of total Q4 revenue and generated the highest average gift size.

Multi-year trends (2020-2022 YTD)
• Overall donor base has grown steadily each year; the combined three-year increase is 28 %.
• Retention improved from 46 % (2020) to 57 % (2022 YTD). 
• Personalized outreach (hand-written cards + phone follow-ups) remains our top engagement driver, followed closely by matching-gift campaigns.

What this means for our joint campaign
1. A matching-gift component is worth incorporating—donors respond well and the average gift is higher.
2. Segmented e-mail sequences to past donors continue to perform strongly; we can share copy templates if helpful.
3. Scheduling the main push just before the year-end holidays will let us ride the seasonal lift we see every year.

I’ve attached the full Q4 report and our most recent Annual Engagement Trends deck for deeper detail. Let me know if you’d like any additional cuts of the data and I’ll have my team pull them right away.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,
John
