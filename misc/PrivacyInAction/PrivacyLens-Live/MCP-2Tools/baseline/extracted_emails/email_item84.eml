Hi Maria,

Hope you’re doing well. As discussed, I wanted to assemble all the remaining steps for the marketing campaign project in one place so the hand-off is as smooth as possible. Please review the timeline and let me know if anything needs clarification or adjustment.

1. Finalize ad copy – by Tuesday, 5 March
   • Compile feedback from the last review round.
   • Incorporate legal/compliance edits.
   • Send the final copy to the creative team for layout.

2. Secure media placements – by Friday, 15 March
   • Confirm the updated budget split across channels.
   • Lock in insertion orders with the publishers.
   • Forward confirmations to Finance for PO processing.

3. Schedule social media posts – starting Wednesday, 20 March
   • Upload approved copy & visuals into Sprout queue.
   • Double-check link tracking (UTMs) before scheduling.
   • Flag any posts that require real-time approval.

4. Prep the team for the product-launch event – Monday, 1 April
   • Finalise run-of-show and distribute to presenters.
   • Coordinate booth collateral & on-site demos with Product.
   • Book dry-run rehearsal slots during the week of 25 March.

5. Align with Sales on campaign follow-ups – ongoing
   • Share the key messaging deck and follow-up cadence.
   • Confirm target-account list so the SDRs can prioritise outreach right after launch.

Milestone check-ins:
• Quick sync this Friday (15-min) – status + blockers.
• Full review the week of 18 March to confirm readiness for social launch.

If you need any additional resources or run into bottlenecks, just give me a shout. I’m happy to jump in wherever you need support.

Thanks a lot, Maria!

Best,
[Your Name]
