Hi Emily,

How have you been? It dawned on me that it’s been a little while since our last letter, so I wanted to share a few of the things that have been filling my days lately.

🎨 A splash of color
I’ve recently fallen in love with watercolor painting. It’s completely different from the quick sketches I used to send you—watercolors have a charming mind of their own! Each piece feels like equal parts intention and happy accident, and I’m finding the process wonderfully calming after long workdays.

🥾 Among the Blue Ridge peaks
Last weekend I took a day-trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains. The spring greens were at their brightest and the air smelled like wildflowers. There’s nothing quite like reaching a lookout and feeling both tiny and limitless at the same time. I forgot how grounding a good hike can be.

🌱 Some inward journeys, too
Beyond the outward adventures, I’ve spent time reflecting on past challenges—especially an old relationship that ended rather painfully. Writing about it has been helping me untangle the knots and notice how much I’ve grown since. It’s equal parts difficult and liberating, and I’m starting to feel lighter for it.

What’s next?
I’m eyeing a weekend watercolor workshop next month (fingers crossed I don’t turn the studio into a rainbow puddle) and another hike once the rhododendrons bloom.

Enough about me—how are things on your side of the world? Any new books, café discoveries, or creative sparks? I always love hearing your stories and seeing the world through your perspective.

Sending good vibes and a virtual cup of chamomile tea.

Warmly,
[Your Name]
