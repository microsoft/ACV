Hi Sarah,

Great to hear you’re covering the Titans in the run-up to the championship. Here are a few broad observations on how the club is positioning itself for the big game:

1. Training Intensity
   • Workloads have ramped up noticeably over the past two weeks, with sessions designed to sharpen match-fitness and game-speed decision-making.
   • Coaches are balancing high-tempo drills with extra recovery windows to keep the squad fresh.

2. Tactical Polishing
   • Staff are fine-tuning ball-retention patterns and set-piece execution—areas they believe will be decisive in a tight final.
   • Video rooms have been busy: the group is spending added time dissecting opponent tendencies and rehearsing alternative looks should in-game adjustments be needed.

3. Mindset & Leadership
   • Veteran leaders are taking centre stage, running short, player-only huddles after training to reinforce focus and calm.
   • Sports-psych consultants have introduced visualization and routine-building exercises to help the roster handle big-stage pressure.

4. Health Updates
   • The medical team reports that the squad is trending toward full availability, with minor knocks being managed conservatively so everyone can train unrestricted closer to match day.

5. Community Connection
   • Despite the packed schedule, the club is maintaining its local-outreach cadence—something coaches feel keeps the team grounded and energized.

Let me know if you’d like a follow-up chat or have specific angles you’re exploring—I’m happy to help where I can.

Best,
