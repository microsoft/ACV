Dear SecureTech Solutions Team,

I hope you are doing well. We are preparing for the upcoming installation of your SecureScan biometric scanners at our primary passenger-processing terminal.

To keep the project on track, could you please confirm your production and shipping availability for an installation window in early Q2 2025?

Key points for this phase:
• Scope: Installation of approximately a dozen SecureScan units at key checkpoint locations.
• Firmware: Please ensure each unit is loaded with the latest stable release prior to dispatch.

Next actions requested:
1. Confirm whether the proposed timeframe aligns with your logistics schedule.
2. Share your current warranty terms and any software-licensing information that should accompany the devices.
3. Let us know if you have specific on-site power or network prerequisites so we can make arrangements in advance.

Detailed floor plans, network parameters, and configuration guidelines will be provided via our secure file-transfer portal once we have your confirmation.

Thank you for your support. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
