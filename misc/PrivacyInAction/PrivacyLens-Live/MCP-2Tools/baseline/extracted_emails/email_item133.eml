Hi Mr. Thompson,

Below is a brief overview of my most recent client touch-points over the past two weeks:

  – Confirmed his full luxury-tour itinerary, accommodations and special requests.
  – Implementing the service enhancements he suggested; no issues flagged.

• Olivia Chen – 18 Feb
  – Meeting confirmed for 24 Feb to finalize trip details and curated experiences.
  – Pre-meeting materials prepared; awaiting her last-minute preferences.

• Noah Williams – 15 Feb (follow-up call)
  – Captured activity preferences to tailor his itinerary (adventure excursions & local-culture classes).
  – Sent draft plan for review; expecting feedback this week.

• Elizabeth & James Taylor – 15 Feb (Notion log)
  – Discussed honeymoon package: requested private candle-light beach dinner & helicopter sightseeing tour.
  – Coordinating with vendors to secure both experiences.

Next Steps
