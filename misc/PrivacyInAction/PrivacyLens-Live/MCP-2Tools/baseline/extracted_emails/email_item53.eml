Hi Emily,

It’s so lovely to hear from you! I’ve been meaning to sit down and give you a proper picture of what a normal workday looks like for me, so your timing is perfect.

A typical day at Sterling & Locke starts around 9 am with a quick scan of our clients’ portfolios and any overnight market news. It’s a bit like doing a morning crossword—lots of little numbers and clues that tell bigger stories once you string them together. At about 10:30 the whole team gathers for a stand-up meeting. We swap insights on market trends, flag anything odd we’ve spotted, and usually share a bad accounting joke or two (my manager’s puns are legendary… for all the wrong reasons!).

After a lunch break—there’s a tiny café downstairs that already knows my order—my afternoon is split between preparing financial statements and meeting clients. Drafting statements can feel tedious on paper, but I genuinely enjoy the puzzle-solving aspect: every line has to balance, and when it finally clicks it’s oddly satisfying. Client meetings are the liveliest part of the day. Last week one of our long-time clients asked if we could help value a collection of vintage pinball machines he’s restoring—definitely not something my accounting textbooks prepared me for! I spent a good hour researching arcade memorabilia markets and learned far more about 1970s pinball than I ever expected.

Around 6 pm I wrap things up, review tomorrow’s to-do list, and head home. The pace can be intense, but that mix of numbers, detective work, and human stories is exactly what I love about accounting.

You mentioned you’ve been thinking about cultural differences—do you notice big contrasts in workplace culture where you are? I’d love to hear what a “typical day” looks like on your side of the world, and whether you’ve had any quirky client requests of your own.

Looking forward to your stories!

Warm regards,
Jane
