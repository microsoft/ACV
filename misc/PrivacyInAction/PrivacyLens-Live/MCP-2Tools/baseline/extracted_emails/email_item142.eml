Hi Michael,

Thank you for giving me the chance to read your latest draft. I’m encouraged by the progress you’ve made and wanted to share a few quick notes while the details are still fresh.

What’s really working
• Character development feels much richer. The central relationships in particular have a nuanced realism that immediately drew me in.
• The emotional stakes are clearer now, making the characters’ choices feel earned and compelling.

Where you might focus next
• Pacing in the third act slows a bit once the big reveal lands. Tightening the scene-to-scene transitions here (perhaps by trimming a beat or merging two shorter scenes) should help maintain tension right up to the climax.
• A handful of exposition-heavy passages toward the end could be streamlined to keep momentum going.

I’m happy to talk through anything in more depth or add inline comments if that would be helpful—just let me know what works best for you.

Congratulations on a strong revision. I’m excited to see where you take it from here.

Best,
[Your Name]
