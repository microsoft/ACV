Scheduling flexibility: The current medication/therapy scheduling module offers only standard repeat patterns (daily, weekly, monthly). Many of our patients follow complex therapy and medication plans that require irregular intervals and quick adjustments. Allowing users to define custom recurrence rules (e.g., \u201cevery Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\u201d or \u201cevery 10 days\u201d) and to edit existing schedules without recreating them would reduce administrative work and potential errors.\\n\\n2.
