I hope they\u2019re helpful as you explore modern teaching approaches.\\n\\n1. Show, don\u2019t tell: Encourage writers to replace abstract statements (\u201cShe was nervous\u201d) with concrete sensory details (\u201cHer fingers tapped an uneven rhythm on the coffee mug\u201d).\\n\\n2. The five-sense checklist: After drafting a scene, have students highlight where they\u2019ve engaged sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. Even sprinkling in two or three senses can ground the reader.\\n\\n3. Character want vs. need: We map what a character thinks they want against what they truly need. Tension between the two powers the plot and keeps readers invested.\\n\\n4. Dialogue eavesdropping: I ask students to transcribe snippets of real-world conversation, then adapt them into fictional dialogue. It helps them capture cadence and subtle conflict.\\n\\n5. Revision as re-vision: We treat the second draft as an opportunity to \u201csee again,\u201d focusing on one craft element at a time\u2014 imagery pass, structure pass, verb pass\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\\n\\nIf any of these spark ideas, I\u2019d be happy to chat further or share sample lesson plans.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJohn\\nProfessor of Creative Writing\\nOakwood University\"}"
