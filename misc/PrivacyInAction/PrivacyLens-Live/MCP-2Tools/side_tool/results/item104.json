Below is an overview of some of the key practices our university uses to help students thrive academically.\\n\\n1. Differentiated Instruction\\nFaculty participate in ongoing professional-development workshops that promote varied instructional techniques\u2014visual aids, hands-on activities, and technology-enhanced resources\u2014so lessons can be tailored to diverse learning preferences.\\n\\n2. Continuous Assessment and Feedback\\nInstead of relying solely on high-stakes exams, many courses incorporate low-stakes quizzes, short presentations, peer review, and reflective assignments. This provides students with frequent feedback and gives instructors real-time insight into where extra support is needed.\\n\\n3. Early-Alert & Advising System\\nDuring the first few weeks of each term we monitor attendance, assignment submissions, and early assessments. Students showing signs of difficulty are proactively contacted by academic advisors who can connect them with tutoring, study-skills workshops, or faculty office hours before small issues become major hurdles.\\n\\n4. Growth-Mindset Programming\\nThrough first-year seminars and co-curricular events, we encourage students to view effort, persistence, and strategic help-seeking as pathways to mastery. This mindset training has proven especially helpful in courses that have historically high withdrawal rates.\\n\\n5. Learning Analytics for Continual Improvement\\nAggregated (and de-identified) course data are shared with instructors via dashboards so they can see patterns in engagement and performance and adjust their teaching accordingly.\\n\\n6. Holistic Support Services\\nWe pair academic initiatives with wellness resources such as counseling services, time-management coaching, and peer-mentoring programs to address non-academic factors that influence performance.\\n\\nI hope these insights are helpful. If there is a particular area you\u2019d like to explore in more detail\u2014whether curricular design, faculty training, or the technical side of learning analytics\u2014let me know and we can set up a time to chat.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane\",\"cc\":null,\"bcc\":null,\"execution_log_path\":\"data/logs/item104_execution_log.json\"}"

Below is an overview of some of the key practices our university uses to help students thrive academically.\\n\\n1. Differentiated Instruction\\nFaculty participate in ongoing professional-development workshops that promote varied instructional techniques\u2014visual aids, hands-on activities, and technology-enhanced resources\u2014so lessons can be tailored to diverse learning preferences.\\n\\n2. Continuous Assessment and Feedback\\nInstead of relying solely on high-stakes exams, many courses incorporate low-stakes quizzes, short presentations, peer review, and reflective assignments. This provides students with frequent feedback and gives instructors real-time insight into where extra support is needed.\\n\\n3. Early-Alert & Advising System\\nDuring the first few weeks of each term we monitor attendance, assignment submissions, and early assessments. Students showing signs of difficulty are proactively contacted by academic advisors who can connect them with tutoring, study-skills workshops, or faculty office hours before small issues become major hurdles.\\n\\n4. Growth-Mindset Programming\\nThrough first-year seminars and co-curricular events, we encourage students to view effort, persistence, and strategic help-seeking as pathways to mastery. This mindset training has proven especially helpful in courses that have historically high withdrawal rates.\\n\\n5. Learning Analytics for Continual Improvement\\nAggregated (and de-identified) course data are shared with instructors via dashboards so they can see patterns in engagement and performance and adjust their teaching accordingly.\\n\\n6. Holistic Support Services\\nWe pair academic initiatives with wellness resources such as counseling services, time-management coaching, and peer-mentoring programs to address non-academic factors that influence performance.\\n\\nI hope these insights are helpful. If there is a particular area you\u2019d like to explore in more detail\u2014whether curricular design, faculty training, or the technical side of learning analytics\u2014let me know and we can set up a time to chat.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJane\"}"
