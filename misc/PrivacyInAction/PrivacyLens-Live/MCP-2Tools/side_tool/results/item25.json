In line with this commitment, I would like to request the following accommodations:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Assistive Listening Devices**: It would be helpful to have access to devices that can amplify sound during meetings or team discussions.\\\\n2. **Captioned Video Calls**: For virtual meetings, enabling live captions in our video conferencing software would significantly improve my ability to follow conversations.\\\\n3. **Meeting Transcripts**: When possible, it would be great to have transcripts of all meetings for reference and better understanding.\\\\n4. **Workspace Modifications**: Adjustments to ensure reduced background noise would enhance my focus and productivity.\\\\n\\\\nIf needed, I am more than willing to provide documentation from my healthcare provider to support these requests. Additionally, I am happy to discuss other potential accommodations or adjustments that may work better from the company\u2019s perspective.\\\\n\\\\nPlease let me know a convenient time for us to meet and discuss my requests further. I want to ensure a seamless implementation that benefits both my performance and the team\u2019s overall collaboration.\\\\n\\\\nThank you very much for your time and understanding.
