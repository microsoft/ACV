Confirm the Governing Rules and Deadlines\\n   \u2022 Start with the local rules, standing orders, and any judge-specific practices.    \\n   \u2022 Double-check statutory or rule-based time limits that might shorten or extend the usual briefing schedule (e.g., motions for summary judgment often have longer notice periods).\\n\\n2. Consider Any Required Pre-Motion Steps\\n   \u2022 Some divisions require a pre-motion conference or a good-faith meet-and-confer certificate before the court will set a briefing schedule.    \\n   \u2022 Document these efforts; many judges will strike a motion that lacks the required certification.\\n\\n3.
