Hi Lisa,

Thank you for taking the time to learn about Ethan. I’ve put together a brief overview that should help you feel prepared during your first days with him.

Daily rhythm (approximate)
• Mornings: Ethan wakes up early, enjoys a warm breakfast (oatmeal with banana is a favorite) and some light movement or stretching.
• Late morning: He likes quiet, hands-on activities such as puzzles.
• Midday: Lunch is usually a simple, warm sandwich followed by story time or music.
• Mid-afternoon: He often has an out-of-the-house appointment and benefits from a calm lead-up and a familiar object for transitions.
• Evenings: Dinner is followed by a nature or animal show, with the bedtime routine starting in the early part of the evening.

Food notes
• Prefers foods served warm and with smooth textures.
• Favorite snacks include apple slices with peanut butter or crackers with cheese.
• A low-noise setting during meals helps him stay comfortable.

Interests & activities
• Loves animals and enjoys simple outings to a zoo or farm.
• Water play and beginner swim sessions are exciting for him.
• Creative outlets like drawing and painting are great rainy-day options.
• Puzzles are both calming and engaging.

Environment & communication tips
• Sudden loud noises can be unsettling; giving him advance notice or offering a quieter space makes a big difference.
• Offering short breaks during busy moments helps him stay regulated and happy.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions as you settle in—I’m always happy to discuss what works (or doesn’t) for Ethan.

Looking forward to working together!

Best,
Jane
