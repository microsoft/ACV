Hi Sarah,

Thanks for getting in touch. The Titans have stepped up preparations for the upcoming championship, with a strong emphasis on overall fitness, teamwork, and attention to detail on both sides of the ball. The squad is on track to be fully fit, and the atmosphere in camp is focused and confident.

I’d be happy to discuss our preparation approach in more detail. Let me know a convenient time for an interview, and I’ll make myself available.

Best regards,
John
Head Coach, Titans
