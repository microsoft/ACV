  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. Here are the main updates since our last check-in:\n\n1. Security System Upgrade\n   \u2022 The new facial-recognition module has been installed at the designated checkpoints.\n   \u2022 Initial validation tests show roughly a 15 % increase in identification accuracy compared to the previous baseline.\n\n2. Traffic-Flow Data Analysis\n   \u2022 The full dataset from last quarter is now cleaned and ready. Your preliminary insights were helpful, and I\u2019ve started running them through our efficiency models.\n   \u2022 The focus this week is to pinpoint the primary bottlenecks and model potential queue-time reductions.\n\n3. Next Steps and Timeline\n   \u2022 Complete the first draft of the bottleneck analysis later this week.\n   \u2022 Integrate the findings into our joint paper outline during the following week.\n   \u2022 Schedule a call early the week after to review results and assign tasks for the optimisation proposal.\n\nLet me know if these timings work for you or if you need any additional information.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",
