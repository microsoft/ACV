Dear Mr. Thompson,

As requested, please find below a concise overview of our department’s adherence to federal regulations governing international students for the 2024–25 academic year.

1. SEVIS Reporting and Record Maintenance
• 100% of active F-1/J-1 student records have been validated within required timelines.
• Change of address, program, and funding updates are entered in SEVIS within the mandated 21-day window.
• No terminations or status lapses were reported this semester.

2. Enrollment Monitoring
• Automated credit-load audits run after each registration adjustment period to ensure all international students maintain full-time enrollment or have approved reduced-course authorizations on file.

3. Orientation & Advising
• Pre-arrival webinars and an in-person orientation were held in August covering status maintenance, employment regulations, and travel.
• Ongoing monthly workshops address CPT/OPT procedures and tax obligations.

4. Faculty & Staff Training
• All academic advisors completed the annual International Student Compliance refresher in September.
• A policy digest highlighting recent DHS/DoS updates was circulated to faculty on October 3rd.

5. Internal Audits
• Quarterly audits continue; the most recent internal review (October) found no discrepancies between university and SEVIS data.

6. Policy Updates
• The department has incorporated the recent DHS interim final rule on STEM OPT fee adjustments into advising materials and has updated our website accordingly.

Moving Forward
We will submit our comprehensive year-end report in December and welcome any guidance you may have in the interim.

Please let me know if you require further details.

Best regards,

Professor Jane [Last Name]
Compliance Liaison, Department of [Department Name]
