Hi Emily,

I hope this message finds you well! It’s been wonderful getting to know you, and I wanted to send along a few little life updates since we were last in touch.

• Hiking joy: Recently I went on a refreshing day-hike in the mountains near me. The greenery and panoramic views were honestly breathtaking, and spending a few hours immersed in nature left me feeling grounded and recharged.

• A new creative outlet: I’ve picked up watercolor painting. The fluidity of the paint is both exciting and unpredictable, and I’m finding it’s a calming way to unwind after work. My first few attempts look a bit like abstract rainbows, but that’s part of the fun!

• Personal reflections: I’ve been journaling a lot and doing some gentle reflection on past challenges. It’s helping me appreciate how far I’ve come and reminding me to be kinder to myself during the ups and downs of everyday life.

Enough about me—how are things in your world? Have you discovered any new hobbies or had a memorable moment recently? I’d love to hear all about it.

Looking forward to your next letter!

Warmly,
Jane
