Dear Justice for All Legal Aid Team,

I hope you are well. My name is Jane, a community advocate coordinating support for immigrants and other vulnerable neighbors in our city. I’m writing to connect you with people who could benefit from your services and to explore possible collaboration.

1. Community Member Seeking Counsel
• One of our community members is looking for guidance on possible pathways to stabilize his situation and keep his family together. He has compiled his preliminary paperwork and is eager to speak with pro-bono counsel.

Your assistance with an introductory consultation or direction to relevant application procedures would be invaluable.

2. Resource Library
• I maintain an up-to-date list of volunteer attorneys, legal clinics, and nonprofits focused on immigration matters. I would be happy to share it so we can streamline referrals and avoid duplicating efforts.

3. Upcoming “Know Your Rights” Workshop – early March
• Our coalition is hosting an evening session on immigrant rights led by volunteer lawyers and advocates. Your team’s participation or feedback on the materials would strengthen the event.

Next Steps
Please let me know if you’d like me to forward the resource list, schedule a quick call, or facilitate an introduction. I’m confident that working together will expand the support we can offer our neighbors.

Thank you for the vital work you do. I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
