Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I’ve been working on a community sports program aimed at engaging local youth in a range of athletic activities, and I’m excited about the possibility of partnering with the Active Youth Foundation.

The proposal focuses on fostering teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles through structured training sessions and sports clinics delivered in collaboration with local schools and sports clubs. I’d love to share the document with you and hear your thoughts on how AYF could get involved—particularly around volunteer coaching, facility access, and outreach.

Would you be available for a brief call or meeting next week to discuss the idea and potential next steps? I’m flexible Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, but can adjust to fit your schedule.

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best regards,
John
