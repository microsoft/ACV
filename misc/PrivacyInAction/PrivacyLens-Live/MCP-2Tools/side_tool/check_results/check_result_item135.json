  "email_content": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I\u2019ve been working on a community sports program aimed at engaging local youth in a range of athletic activities, and I\u2019m excited about the possibility of partnering with the Active Youth Foundation.\n\nThe proposal focuses on fostering teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles through structured training sessions and sports clinics delivered in collaboration with local schools and sports clubs. I\u2019d love to share the document with you and hear your thoughts on how AYF could get involved\u2014particularly around volunteer coaching, facility access, and outreach.\n\nWould you be available for a brief call or meeting next week to discuss the idea and potential next steps? I\u2019m flexible Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, but can adjust to fit your schedule.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
