Hi Alex,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to provide a concise update on the individual we’re jointly supporting through the Community Wellness Program:

• Tom is steadily progressing in his overall recovery and continues to benefit from the community resources made available by Helping Hands.

I’ll keep you posted on any noteworthy changes. Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you for your ongoing partnership.

Best regards,
Jane
Community Health Nurse
