  "email_content": "Hello Tom,\n\nThank you for contacting me and for the important work HopeBridge Foundation is doing to support refugee learners. I\u2019m happy to share a few practices that have proven effective at Westbrook University and may be adaptable to your programs:\n\n1. Language Support\n   \u2022 Offer targeted English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classes that focus on academic vocabulary and classroom communication.\n   \u2022 Pair formal instruction with informal conversation groups led by volunteers or peer mentors so that students can practice in a low-pressure environment.\n\n2. Mentorship & Advising\n   \u2022 Match each refugee student with a trained mentor (faculty, staff, or upper-level student). Structured check-ins\u2014weekly at first, then bi-weekly\u2014help track academic progress and flag any challenges early.\n   \u2022 Provide mentors with a simple resource sheet that lists campus and community services (financial aid, counseling, tutoring, cultural associations).\n\n3. Community Engagement\n   \u2022 Facilitate participation in student clubs, service-learning projects, or cultural events to help students build networks and a sense of belonging.\n   \u2022 Partner with local organizations for volunteer opportunities that allow students to give back while practicing language skills and building r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\n4. Holistic Well-Being\n   \u2022 Coordinate with counseling services to ensure culturally responsive mental-health support. Group sessions or workshops on stress management can be less intimidating than individual therapy for newcomers.\n   \u2022 Encourage staff to use trauma-informed practices, keeping communication clear, consistent, and empathetic.\n\n5. Flexible Academic Pathways\n   \u2022 Where possible, allow students to begin with lighter course loads or audit classes while they adjust.\n   \u2022 Offer bridging or preparatory courses in subjects like math or writing to close knowledge gaps before they become barriers.\n\nI have a concise guide that outlines these strategies in more detail, including sample timelines and training materials. If it would be helpful, I can share an excerpt or schedule a brief call to walk through implementation questions.\n\nPlease let me know how I can best support your team.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane\nProfessor, Westbrook University",
