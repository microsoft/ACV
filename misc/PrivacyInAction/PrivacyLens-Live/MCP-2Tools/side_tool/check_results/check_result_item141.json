  "email_content": "Hi Ethan,\n\nI hope you\u2019re well. I\u2019m excited to get started on the cover for Clara Bellamy\u2019s upcoming novel, \"Whispers of the Past.\" Below is our design brief and logistical info. Please let me know if anything needs clarification.\n\nDesign concept\n\u2022  Mood: mysterious and nostalgic, with a subtle sense of intrigue.\n\u2022  Key visual elements: an old ornate key and a faded handwritten letter. Feel free to experiment with layout, but these two items should be unmistakable.\n\u2022  Colour palette: muted earth tones (warm sepia, moss green, touches of antique gold). Nothing overly bright or saturated.\n\u2022  Typography: an elegant serif for the title and a clean sans-serif for Clara\u2019s name. We\u2019re open to your recommendations.\n\nSpecs & deliverables\n\u2022  Trim size: 6\" \u00d7 9\" (trade paperback).\n\u2022  Spine width: we\u2019ll confirm once the final page count is locked (estimate 0.85\" for now).\n\u2022  Formats: front cover, full wrap (front/spine/back), e-book cover (JPEG, 2560 px on the longest side), and a social-media teaser graphic.\n\u2022  Resolution: 300 DPI, CMYK for print; RGB for web versions.\n\u2022  File formats: print-ready PDF plus layered PSD or AI source files.\n\nTimeline\n\u2022  Concept thumbnails (2 options): by Mon 27 May.\n\u2022  First full draft: by Mon 3 Jun.\n\u2022  Final approved files: by Fri 14 Jun.\n\nReference materials\nI\u2019ve attached the manuscript synopsis and Clara\u2019s short bio for additional context. Let me know if you need anything else.\n\nBudget & admin\nAs discussed, Griffin & Locke will issue a 50 % deposit upon approval of the chosen concept, with the balance payable on delivery of the final files. Please send your invoice when you share the first full draft.\n\nThanks, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing your ideas!\n\nBest,\nJane\nSenior Editor | Griffin & Locke Publishing House",
