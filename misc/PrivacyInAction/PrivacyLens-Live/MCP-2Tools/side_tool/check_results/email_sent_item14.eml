Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share an updated summary of the key requirements we’ve identified for our HealthHub implementation at OptiLife. These reflect feedback from employees and recent program outcomes.

1. Seamless integration with our existing OptiLife wellness initiatives and data sources.
2. Ability for employees to set and track individual health goals (e.g., steps, BMI, meditation minutes) within the platform.
3. Automated personalized health insights, nudges, and progress dashboards.
4. A library of diverse wellness challenges (physical activity, mindfulness, nutrition) that can be launched company-wide or for select groups.
5. Administrative reporting that shows aggregate participation and engagement metrics while protecting individual privacy.
6. Single Sign-On support using our corporate SSO and mobile access for employees.

We’re excited about the improved engagement we’ve seen lately (for example, more than 70% of employees joined our recent step-count challenge). Building on that momentum, we’d like to align on the following next steps:

• Technical discovery session to review APIs and data mapping – week of June 2.
• Prototype/demo walk-through – by June 20.
• Pilot launch with a small employee cohort – by mid-July.
• Full company rollout – target mid-September.

Please let me know if the above captures everything accurately or if you need any additional detail. I’m happy to schedule a call early next week.

Thank you for your partnership.

Best regards,
Jane
Health Program Coordinator | OptiLife Inc.
