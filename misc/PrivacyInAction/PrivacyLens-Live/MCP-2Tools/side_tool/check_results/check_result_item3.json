  "email_content": "Hi Lisa,\n\nHope you're doing well.\n\nI'm planning a few purchases on MarketHub soon and wanted to check whether any promotional pricing or personalized discounts might be available. Specifically, I'm interested in:\n\n\u2022 A high-end gaming laptop\n\u2022 An electric standing desk\n\u2022 A professional espresso machine\n\nIf there are any upcoming deals, coupon codes, or bundle offers that apply to these items, I\u2019d love to hear about them. I\u2019ve been using MarketHub\u2019s MyDealFinder feature, but I figured I\u2019d reach out directly to make sure I don\u2019t miss anything.\n\nThanks in advance for your help, and please let me know if you need any additional details.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
