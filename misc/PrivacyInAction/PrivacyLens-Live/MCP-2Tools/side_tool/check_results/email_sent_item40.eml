Dear Bright Futures Scholarship Committee,

Thank you for your follow-up regarding Michael Smith’s application. I am pleased to provide further details highlighting his academic performance and extracurricular leadership.

Academic excellence
• Michael is currently a junior at Oakwood High School and consistently maintains a top-tier GPA, earning A+ marks across all core subjects.
• His passion for STEM is reflected in his first-place finish at the 2021 Regional Science Fair for his project on renewable-energy storage.

Leadership and service
• Elected Student Council President this year, Michael led the planning of our annual charity carnival, coordinating 40+ volunteers and raising more than $5,000 for local shelters.
• As captain of the debate team, he mentors younger students and has guided the team to state-level finals.
• Outside school, he volunteers at the community food bank where he averages two Saturdays each month assisting with distribution and outreach.

We believe these accomplishments, together with the letter of recommendation from Ms. Thompson that you already have on file, demonstrate Michael’s readiness to excel in the Bright Futures program.

Please let me know if any other documentation would be helpful.

Sincerely,
John [Last Name]
Guidance Counselor | Oakwood High School
