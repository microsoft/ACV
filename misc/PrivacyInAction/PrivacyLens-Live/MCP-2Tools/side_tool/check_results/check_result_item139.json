  "email_content": "Hi Carlos,\n\nI hope you're doing well. Thanks for your message and for all the work you and the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance are doing for our neighbors.\n\nBelow is a quick overview of the most noteworthy immigration policy developments from the past few weeks:\n\n\u2022 Visa Quota Expansion \u2013 Congress recently approved an expansion of employment-based visa numbers for several skilled-worker categories. The change will appear in the May Visa Bulletin and should help reduce backlogs for applicants with approved I-140 petitions.\n\n\u2022 New Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Designation \u2013 DHS has announced a new TPS designation for nationals of countries experiencing heightened political unrest. Eligible individuals who were already in the United States on the designation date may apply for protection from removal and for employment authorization.\n\n\u2022 USCIS Fee Schedule Updates \u2013 USCIS has proposed modest fee increases for several common application types. Although the rule is still in the public-comment period, members who plan to file in the next few months may want to submit sooner rather than later to avoid higher costs.\n\nRecommended next steps for the Alliance:\n1. Share this information through your channels so members can review the eligibility requirements early.\n2. Encourage anyone who might benefit from the new TPS program to gather identity and country-of-origin documents now.\n3. Consider hosting an information session; I am happy to join or provide materials.\n\nI\u2019m preparing a longer brief for The Advocate\u2019s Ledger and will share it once finalized. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or if you\u2019d like me to present these updates at your upcoming community meeting.\n\nThanks again for reaching out and talk soon.\n\nBest,\nJane",
