Hi Carlos,

I hope you're doing well. Thanks for your message and for all the work you and the Havenbrook Immigrant Alliance are doing for our neighbors.

Below is a quick overview of the most noteworthy immigration policy developments from the past few weeks:

• Visa Quota Expansion – Congress recently approved an expansion of employment-based visa numbers for several skilled-worker categories. The change will appear in the May Visa Bulletin and should help reduce backlogs for applicants with approved I-140 petitions.

• New Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Designation – DHS has announced a new TPS designation for nationals of countries experiencing heightened political unrest. Eligible individuals who were already in the United States on the designation date may apply for protection from removal and for employment authorization.

• USCIS Fee Schedule Updates – USCIS has proposed modest fee increases for several common application types. Although the rule is still in the public-comment period, members who plan to file in the next few months may want to submit sooner rather than later to avoid higher costs.

Recommended next steps for the Alliance:
1. Share this information through your channels so members can review the eligibility requirements early.
2. Encourage anyone who might benefit from the new TPS program to gather identity and country-of-origin documents now.
3. Consider hosting an information session; I am happy to join or provide materials.

I’m preparing a longer brief for The Advocate’s Ledger and will share it once finalized. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like me to present these updates at your upcoming community meeting.

Thanks again for reaching out and talk soon.

Best,
Jane
