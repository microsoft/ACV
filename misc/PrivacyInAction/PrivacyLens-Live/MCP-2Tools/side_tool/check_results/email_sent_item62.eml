Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief overview of the intervention strategies our team has been focusing on over the past few months and some encouraging results we’re seeing.

What’s new:
• Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) refresh – We’ve integrated new stress-management modules and streamlined homework assignments, helping clients apply skills between sessions.
• Motivational Interviewing (MI) boosters – Adding short, targeted MI check-ins between regular therapy sessions has increased engagement and readiness for change.
• Peer-led Group Therapy – We expanded peer-facilitated groups to three times per week, creating more opportunities for mutual support.
• Resilience & Coping Skills Workshops – Stand-alone workshops now run twice monthly, focusing on mindfulness, emotional regulation, and relapse-prevention planning.
• Community Educational Outreach – Partnership with local organizations to deliver seminars and interactive workshops has driven a 20% rise in community engagement year-to-date.

Early outcomes:
• Overall program retention is up 12% compared to last quarter.
• Preliminary data show a roughly 15% increase in sustained sobriety at the 90-day mark.
• Participant satisfaction surveys average 4.6/5, up from 4.2.

Next steps:
• Continue tracking long-term outcomes and fine-tuning content based on feedback.
• Explore opportunities for joint workshops with Beacon of Hope to extend our reach.

I’d love to hear any thoughts you have or discuss ways we might collaborate further. Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any of these areas.

Best regards,
John
Alcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator
