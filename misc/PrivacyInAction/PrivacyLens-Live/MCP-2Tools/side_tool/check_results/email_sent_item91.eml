Hi Sarah,

Sharing a quick status update on our two active initiatives:

1. Health Empowerment and Awareness Program (HEAP)
   • Curriculum for the educational workshops is nearly complete. Pamphlet designs are with the comms team for final polish.
   • Next steps (this week):
       – Finalize the workshop curriculum and upload it to the shared drive.
       – Confirm venue availability for the first session planned for early June.
       – Begin recording the short video segments for the web resources.

2. Vax4All Vaccination Drive
   • We have identified three suitable public venues in Oakwood Village for temporary vaccination sites.
   • Local healthcare partners have signaled their availability to staff the events.
   • Next steps (this week):
       – Secure written confirmations from partners.
       – Finalize volunteer orientation materials and schedule a training call for later this week.
       – Send out the first batch of outreach communications once comms signs off on graphics.

Let me know if you spot any gaps or if there’s anything else I should tackle.

Best,
John
