Hi Susan,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m pleased to share the first draft of our Team Retreat Proposal for Bright Horizons Marketing Solutions. The focus is on creating an inclusive, engaging experience that everyone can enjoy.

Team Retreat Proposal (Draft)
--------------------------------------------------
Objective:
Design a retreat that fosters collaboration, creativity, and team cohesion while ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for all participants.

Key Elements:
1. Activities
   • Physical: Guided nature hike on gentle trails.
   • Creative: Painting or pottery workshop led by a local artist.
   • Team-building: Trust-building and problem-solving challenges facilitated by a professional coach.

2. Venue Criteria
   • Accessible facilities (ramps/elevators, accessible restrooms, adaptable meeting spaces).
   • Comfortable accommodation options (single rooms and shared cabins).
   • On-site and nearby spaces for both indoor and outdoor activities.

3. Meals & Dietary Accommodation
   • Menus offering vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher choices as part of standard meal planning.
   • Clear labeling of ingredients and allergens.
   • Coordination with catering staff to accommodate additional requests.

4. Schedule Outline (2.5 days)
   • Day 1: Arrival, welcome lunch, afternoon creative workshop, evening mixer.
   • Day 2: Morning hike, lunch, afternoon team-building session, free time, group dinner.
   • Day 3: Strategy discussion, closing reflections, departure after lunch.

5. Budget Range
   • Estimated cost per person (lodging, meals, activities, transportation) – $XXX–$XXX (final numbers pending venue quotes).

Next Steps:
• Please let me know if you’d like any adjustments or additional details.
• Once we have your feedback, I’ll request quotes from the top venues and refine the budget.

I’ve also saved the proposal in Notion for easy reference: [Internal Link – Team Retreat Proposal].

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

Best regards,
John
