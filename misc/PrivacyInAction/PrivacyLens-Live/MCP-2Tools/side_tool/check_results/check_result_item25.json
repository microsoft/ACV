  "email_content": "Hi Team,\n\nI\u2019d like to share a few quick updates regarding our office environment and some workflow enhancements:\n\n1. Office Renovation:\n   \u2022 Starting next week, the ground-floor common work areas and break room will undergo renovation. During this period, all impacted employees will temporarily relocate to the upper floors.\n   \u2022 Expect some intermittent noise; meeting rooms on floors 2\u20133 remain available for booking if you need a quieter space.\n\n2. Ergonomic Upgrades:\n   \u2022 Based on recent feedback, we\u2019re ordering adjustable desks and monitor arms for workstations that need them.\n   \u2022 Facilities will coordinate installation times directly with each team to minimize disruption.\n\n3. Accessibility Improvements:\n   \u2022 Live captioning will be enabled by default in our video-conferencing tools.\n   \u2022 Meeting transcripts can be provided upon request.\n   \u2022 Additional assistive technology options are being evaluated. If you have specific needs, please reach out to HR.\n\n4. Quiet Zones & Noise Management:\n   \u2022 To support focused work, we\u2019re designating quiet-zone areas on the 3rd floor.\n   \u2022 Please keep conversations and calls to a minimum in these zones.\n\n5. Workflow Adjustments (Renovation Period):\n   \u2022 Daily stand-ups can be held in hybrid format to reduce gathering sizes.\n   \u2022 Remember to update project boards by end of day so remote participants stay in sync.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and for continuing to share your suggestions. If you have any questions or additional feedback, feel free to reach out.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n",
