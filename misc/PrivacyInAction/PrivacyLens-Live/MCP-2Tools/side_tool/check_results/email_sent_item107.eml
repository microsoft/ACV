Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a brief summary of our most recent donor engagement metrics that should help with planning our next joint initiative:

Overall Trends (Past 12 Months)
• Consistent year-over-year growth in both donor count and total contributions.  
• Personalized outreach and matching-gift promotions remain our two highest-performing tactics.

Q4 2021 Highlights
• Donor participation rose by approximately 15% compared with Q3.  
• Holiday-season giving drove a particularly strong response.

Campaign Effectiveness
• Our targeted email series to prior supporters achieved a 20% conversion rate.  
• Social media ads coupled with brief testimonial videos delivered the best engagement cost-per-click.

Next Steps
I’m happy to share any additional details or dig deeper into specific segments once we align on the campaign goals and audience.

Let me know what else would be useful.

Best regards,
John
Bright Futures Foundation
