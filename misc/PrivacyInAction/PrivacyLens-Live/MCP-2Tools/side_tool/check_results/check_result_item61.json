Carlos\u2019s case: we\u2019ve gathered the latest paperwork and will be meeting early next week to map out the next steps. Things remain on track and I\u2019ll keep you posted once we have firm news.\n\n2. Community legal clinic: all 50 slots for the upcoming clinic are now filled. Thanks for helping spread the word! If anyone has registered but can no longer attend, please let me know so we can offer the spot to someone on the wait-list.\n\n3. Know Your Rights workshops: we\u2019ve finalized the schedule with the Immigrant Aid Society. Sessions will take place on March 1st, 3rd and 5th. Flyers and sign-up links will follow shortly; feel free to let folks know the dates so they can save the time.\n\nThank you for everything you do for the community, and let me know if there are any questions.\n\nBest,\n\nJohn",
