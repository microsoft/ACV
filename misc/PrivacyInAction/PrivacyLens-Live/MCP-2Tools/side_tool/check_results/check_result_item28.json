  "email_content": "Dear Mrs. Thompson,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding Ethan\u2019s recent absences. He has been away from school for health-related reasons that required follow-up appointments and brief recovery time at home. I can confirm that his parents and I expect he will be able to return to school in the coming week, provided his recovery continues as anticipated.\n\nTo support Ethan when he is on campus, the following general considerations may be helpful:\n\n\u2022 Flexibility for occasional late arrivals or early departures when appointments are scheduled.\n\u2022 Permission for short, seated rest breaks during the school day.\n\u2022 Additional time to transition between classes and to complete written assignments or tests if fatigue is a factor.\n\u2022 Easy access to water and a quiet area should he need a brief rest.\n\nPlease let me know if the school needs any specific forms or documentation to put these accommodations in place.\n\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Ethan\u2019s well-being and educational success.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Jane Doe, MD\nPediatrician",
