Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you are doing well. I am currently preparing for an upcoming filing in one of my active matters and would greatly value your perspective on a few strategic points. At your convenience, could we schedule a brief call, or alternatively, could you share any observations regarding:

• Approaches for strengthening evidentiary submissions ahead of the upcoming deadline;
• Effective ways to anticipate opposing counsel’s arguments in complex commercial disputes;
• Recommendations for presenting technical documentation clearly to the court.

I can forward a concise brief prior to our discussion if that would be helpful.

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
