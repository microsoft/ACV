Dear Mr. Griffin,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to provide a brief status update on my current projects:

1. Helena Blythe – “Whispers of the Past”
   • Editing completed on 17 May.
   • Key improvements incorporated include tightening plot pacing in chapters 12–15 and refining character arcs for supporting cast.
   • Helena has signed off on the changes and has expressed strong appreciation for our editorial support.
   • The manuscript is ready for final proofread pass and hand-off to Production. I have already scheduled this for early next week.

2. Upcoming titles
   • I have started preliminary review of Marcus Ellery’s historical nonfiction proposal; I expect to deliver a detailed editorial plan by 30 May.
   • I am also holding a slot in June for the second installment of Dana Wu’s mystery series once her draft arrives.

Workflow/Capacity
• All active tasks are on schedule, and I have approximately 15% capacity available should any priority projects arise.

Please let me know if you would like any additional details or adjustments.

Best regards,
John
