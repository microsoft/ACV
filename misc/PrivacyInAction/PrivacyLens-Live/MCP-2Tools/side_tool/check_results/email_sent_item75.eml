Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re well. I have identified three elderly patients this week who could benefit from Helping Hands’ programs:

• One needs reliable transportation to frequent medical appointments.
• Another requires transportation to therapy sessions.
• A third would appreciate regular companionship visits.

Could we set up a brief call or use the secure referral portal so I can share the specific details and complete any necessary paperwork?

Thanks so much for your ongoing partnership and support.

Best regards,
John
