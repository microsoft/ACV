Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is John, and I just joined the team at Zenith Innovations this week. I’ll be working closely with you on the upcoming project, and I wanted to reach out and introduce myself.

A quick bit about me: I’m passionate about creative problem-solving and enjoy turning ideas into actionable solutions. Outside of work, you’ll usually find me behind a camera or hiking a trail—photography and exploring the outdoors help keep my creativity flowing.

I’m eager to learn more about your work and how I can best contribute to the project’s success. Please let me know a convenient time for a quick call or coffee chat so we can compare notes and get started on the right foot.

Looking forward to collaborating with you!

Best regards,
John
