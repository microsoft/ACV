Core Capabilities\n   \u2022 Real-time performance metrics \u2013 visibility into project completion rates, sales target attainment, and customer-service response times.\n   \u2022 Customizable dashboards \u2013 each user should be able to tailor their view to focus on the metrics most relevant to their role.\n   \u2022 HR system integration \u2013 the PTS needs to exchange employee and performance data with our existing HR platform through a secure API.\n\n2. Timeline\n   \u2022 Development kickoff: early Q3.\n   \u2022 Internal pilot: six-month window following kickoff to capture feedback and iterate.\n\n3.
