Hi Elaine,

I hope you’re well. As promised, I’ve compiled key insights from our recent analysis of passenger perceptions of public spaces in airports:

• Security checkpoints remain the primary stress touch-point. Passengers emphasised the value of clearer communication, opportunities for private screening, and staff who provide empathetic explanations of procedures.

• Empathetic design matters. Calming visuals, balanced ambient lighting, and considerate signage all help lower perceived stress and wait times.

• Safety expectations extend beyond checkpoints. Travellers expressed a desire for discreet, but visible, security and enhanced design attention in secondary spaces such as restrooms and corridors, especially those that currently feel less monitored.

• Personalised way-finding and designated quiet/rest areas contribute to a stronger sense of control and overall comfort.

Next steps I’m proposing:
1. Set up a design workshop with the Skyward Terminal architects to explore integrating these findings.
2. Refine our passenger-stress questionnaire to capture more granular data on secondary spaces.
3. Align the qualitative themes with your environmental stressor framework to develop practical design guidelines.

Let me know if these priorities align with your research schedule, or if you’d like to add anything.

Best regards,
John
