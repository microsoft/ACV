Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Ethan’s recent absences. He has been away from school for health-related reasons that required follow-up appointments and brief recovery time at home. I can confirm that his parents and I expect he will be able to return to school in the coming week, provided his recovery continues as anticipated.

To support Ethan when he is on campus, the following general considerations may be helpful:

• Flexibility for occasional late arrivals or early departures when appointments are scheduled.
• Permission for short, seated rest breaks during the school day.
• Additional time to transition between classes and to complete written assignments or tests if fatigue is a factor.
• Easy access to water and a quiet area should he need a brief rest.

Please let me know if the school needs any specific forms or documentation to put these accommodations in place.

Thank you for your partnership in supporting Ethan’s well-being and educational success.

Best regards,

Dr. Jane Doe, MD
Pediatrician
