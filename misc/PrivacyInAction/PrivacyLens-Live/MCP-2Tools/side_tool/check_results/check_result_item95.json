  "email_content": "Dear CodeCrafters Team,\n\nAs requested, please find below the high-level information that should help your team move forward with the software upgrade for Trustworthy Banking Group.\n\n1. Customer Satisfaction Statistics\n   \u2022 Our most recent annual customer-satisfaction survey (2021) reported an overall satisfaction score of 85%. The top drivers were friendly staff and efficient service. Key areas for improvement include reduced wait times and expanded digital services.\n\n2. Branch Performance Metrics (Most Recent Quarter \u2013 Q4)\n   \u2022 Total customer transactions across all branches: approx. 120,000 (about 5% growth versus Q3).\n   \u2022 Customer-satisfaction rate recorded at branches during this period: 90%.\n   \u2022 All key performance indicators remained on or above target levels.\n\n3. Internal Audit Highlights Relevant to System Requirements\n   \u2022 Recent internal reviews underscored the importance of stronger audit-trail capabilities, tighter reconciliation processes, and improved documentation workflows.\n   \u2022 The upgraded system should therefore provide: comprehensive transaction logs, automated reconciliation support, secure document storage, and robust role-based access controls.\n\n4. Current Digital Infrastructure Overview\n   \u2022 We currently operate a centralized, legacy database system that handles core transactions and data storage.\n   \u2022 Primary objectives for the upgrade include: enhanced security (e.g., encryption at rest/in transit), faster transaction processing, modular architecture for easier future enhancements, better reporting/analytics, and seamless integration with our online-banking and mobile platforms.\n\nIf your team needs any additional context, data samples, or clarification, please let me know and I will be happy to provide them.\n\nLooking forward to our continued collaboration.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn [Last Name]\nBank Manager | Trustworthy Banking Group",
