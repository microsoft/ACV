  "email_content": "Hi Emily,\n\nThank you for your note and the kind words. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re moving forward with your patent application, and I\u2019m happy to share some high-level pointers that consistently help applicants strengthen their filings:\n\n1. Prior-art diligence \u2013 Before finalizing your draft, run a comprehensive literature and patent search. Identifying the closest references early lets us tailor the claims to emphasize what truly differentiates your invention.\n\n2. Claim hierarchy \u2013 Start with a broad independent claim that captures the core inventive concept, then add a set of progressively narrower dependent claims. This layered approach creates fallback positions if the examiner cites prior art.\n\n3. Detailed embodiments \u2013 Provide concrete examples of how the invention is implemented and its real-world advantages. Examiners appreciate specificity, and it reduces the risk of enablement rejections.\n\n4. Data and prototypes \u2013 Where possible, include test results, working prototypes, or comparative data that illustrate performance gains. Objective evidence can be persuasive when overcoming obviousness rejections.\n\n5. Accelerated options \u2013 If timing is critical, we can explore programs like USPTO\u2019s Track One Prioritized Examination. They require an additional fee but often yield a first office action within months instead of the usual year-plus timeline.\n\n6. Examiner perspective \u2013 When the application is assigned, we can review the examiner\u2019s past decisions to anticipate preferred claim formats or objections. Preparing responses in advance keeps prosecution efficient.\n\nNext steps: If you\u2019d like, we can schedule a brief call to discuss your draft and any particular concerns. Feel free to propose a few times that work for you this week or next.\n\nLooking forward to helping you put together a robust application.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nInnovatech Patents",
