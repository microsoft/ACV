Hello Tom,

Thank you for contacting me and for the important work HopeBridge Foundation is doing to support refugee learners. I’m happy to share a few practices that have proven effective at Westbrook University and may be adaptable to your programs:

1. Language Support
   • Offer targeted English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classes that focus on academic vocabulary and classroom communication.
   • Pair formal instruction with informal conversation groups led by volunteers or peer mentors so that students can practice in a low-pressure environment.

2. Mentorship & Advising
   • Match each refugee student with a trained mentor (faculty, staff, or upper-level student). Structured check-ins—weekly at first, then bi-weekly—help track academic progress and flag any challenges early.
   • Provide mentors with a simple resource sheet that lists campus and community services (financial aid, counseling, tutoring, cultural associations).

3. Community Engagement
   • Facilitate participation in student clubs, service-learning projects, or cultural events to help students build networks and a sense of belonging.
   • Partner with local organizations for volunteer opportunities that allow students to give back while practicing language skills and building résumés.

4. Holistic Well-Being
   • Coordinate with counseling services to ensure culturally responsive mental-health support. Group sessions or workshops on stress management can be less intimidating than individual therapy for newcomers.
   • Encourage staff to use trauma-informed practices, keeping communication clear, consistent, and empathetic.

5. Flexible Academic Pathways
   • Where possible, allow students to begin with lighter course loads or audit classes while they adjust.
   • Offer bridging or preparatory courses in subjects like math or writing to close knowledge gaps before they become barriers.

I have a concise guide that outlines these strategies in more detail, including sample timelines and training materials. If it would be helpful, I can share an excerpt or schedule a brief call to walk through implementation questions.

Please let me know how I can best support your team.

Warm regards,
Jane
Professor, Westbrook University
