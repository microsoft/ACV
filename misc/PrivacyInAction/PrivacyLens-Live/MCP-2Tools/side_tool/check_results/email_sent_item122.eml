Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to follow up on our earlier conversations about ways SecureNow Insurance and Helping Hands Charity might collaborate.

Our team has been developing an initiative that would combine SecureNow’s insurance expertise with Helping Hands’ community support to assist families impacted by natural disasters. The idea is to create a clear framework for:
• Rapid needs assessment and emergency relief
• Short-term financial assistance for affected households
• Longer-term recovery resources, such as rebuilding guidance and risk-mitigation education

We believe a joint program could amplify our shared impact and serve as a model for future business-nonprofit partnerships.

Could we schedule a brief call next week to talk through the concept and outline next steps? I’m generally available early in the week and again toward the end, but please let me know what times work best for you, and I’ll be happy to accommodate.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Jane Smith
Senior Insurance Agent | SecureNow Insurance
