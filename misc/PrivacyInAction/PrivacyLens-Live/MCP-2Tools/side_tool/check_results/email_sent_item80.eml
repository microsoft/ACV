Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m excited to share that Bright Futures Foundation is launching a new literacy initiative called “Read to Succeed.” The program is designed to help children aged 6–10 strengthen their reading skills through engaging weekly sessions and access to age-appropriate books.

We’re currently seeking partners to help us scale the program’s impact. Support from Helping Hands Alliance could provide:
• Diverse, high-quality reading materials for participating students
• Training resources for volunteers who will lead the weekly sessions
• Community outreach activities to encourage family involvement

I’d welcome the chance to discuss how Helping Hands Alliance and Bright Futures Foundation can collaborate on this initiative. Are you available for a brief call next week?

Thank you for considering this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Program Coordinator
