Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out about ways we can deepen student engagement in our classes. I’ve been reflecting on the past few semesters and wanted to share a handful of strategies that have worked particularly well for me:

1. Start with a provocative question – Opening each session with a short, open-ended question tied to the day’s reading has sparked early participation and set an inquisitive tone.

2. Anchor theory in real-world examples – Bringing in an article, short video clip, or case study that illustrates the concept we’re covering helps students see immediate relevance and usually leads to richer discussion.

3. Student-led discussion segments – When small groups take responsibility for leading 8-10 minutes of the conversation, their peers tend to listen more actively and ask sharper questions.

4. Quick pulse checks – Simple one-question polls (e.g., Google Forms or the LMS poll tool) mid-class let me gauge understanding and adjust on the fly.

5. Exit tickets – A one-sentence takeaway or lingering question at the end of class gives me insight into what resonated and what needs follow-up.

Across my Social Inequality seminar, implementing the opening question and student-led segments increased voluntary participation by about a quarter compared with the previous offering.

I’d be glad to compare notes in more detail or even co-facilitate a short department workshop before the new term starts. Let me know what might be most useful on your end.

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best,
Jane
