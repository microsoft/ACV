Dear Dr. Smith,

I have reviewed the latest passenger traffic data and wanted to share some preliminary ideas for improving passenger flow in the terminal:

1. Expand and re-configure the security checkpoint to create additional screening lanes. A zig-zag entry layout combined with dedicated lanes for PreCheck and crew should reduce back-ups at peak times.

2. Deploy an adaptive queue-management system that uses overhead sensors and real-time wait-time display monitors to dynamically allocate passengers to the shortest line.

3. Integrate biometric e-gates (face and fingerprint recognition) at the ID verification stage. Our simulations indicate this could cut average processing time per passenger by 30–40 % while maintaining current security standards.

Please let me know your thoughts or if you’d like to discuss further details. I can prepare a more detailed schematic once we confirm the general direction.

Best regards,
John
