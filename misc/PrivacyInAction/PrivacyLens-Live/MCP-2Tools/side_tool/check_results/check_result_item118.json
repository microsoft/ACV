  "email_content": "Hi Maria,\n\nI hope this message finds you well and that spring in Barcelona is treating you kindly.\n\nIt\u2019s been a little while since we last exchanged letters, so I wanted to reach out and see how you\u2019re doing. How is your sociology program going? Are you still focusing on substance-abuse treatment in your research? I\u2019d love to hear about any new insights or projects you\u2019re working on.\n\nThings at Serenity Path have been busy but rewarding. We\u2019ve recently been refining some of our group-therapy and after-care programs, and it\u2019s encouraging to see many of our participants gaining confidence and building sustainable routines. If any of that would be useful for your coursework, just let me know\u2014I\u2019m always happy to share non-confidential materials or point you toward resources.\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019ve been spending my weekends hiking nearby trails and experimenting with sourdough baking (with mixed results!). What have you been up to when you\u2019re not immersed in studies?\n\nLet\u2019s try not to let so much time pass before our next catch-up. If you\u2019d like to set up a video chat, just suggest a time.\n\nSending warm regards from our side of the Atlantic,\n\nJohn",
