Below is the initial high-level information your developers requested so they can continue with system design.\n\n1. Key Milestones\n   \u2022 Initial system design due: March 15, 2022  \n   \u2022 First prototype ready for internal testing: June 1, 2022  \n   \u2022 Final implementation / go-live: September 30, 2022\n\n2. Data Security Expectations\n   \u2022 All data transmitted and stored must be encrypted using strong industry standards (e.g., AES-256 in transit and at rest).  \n   \u2022 Quarterly security audits and penetration tests are required.  \n   \u2022 Role-based access control: production data are accessible only to authorised Metro Health Authority personnel and approved contractors.\n\n3. User Interface Requirements\n   \u2022 Intuitive dashboard tailored for health-service officers to view aggregated metrics.  \n   \u2022 Real-time analytics visible on the main interface.  \n   \u2022 Customisable report generation for key health indicators.\n\nNext steps\n\u2022 Please confirm the milestone dates are feasible for your team.  \n\u2022 Let us know any clarifications you need on the above points.  \n\u2022 Once the NDA addendum is completed, we will share the detailed technical specification and data schemas through our secure file portal.\n\nLooking forward to working together.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe  \nPublic Health Service Officer  \nMetro Health Authority",
