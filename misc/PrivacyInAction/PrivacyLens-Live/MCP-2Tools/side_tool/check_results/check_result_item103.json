I wanted to share a short update on recent activities at St. Mary\u2019s Parish and touch base about the upcoming charity event we\u2019re planning together.\n\nParish updates so far this year:\n\u2022 Winter Clothing Drive (late January) \u2013 We collected more than 120 coats along with scarves, gloves and hats that have already been delivered to local shelters.\n\u2022 Community Soup Kitchen \u2013 Attendance continues to grow, and we\u2019re now serving hot meals every Tuesday evening.\n\u2022 Youth Service Day (early February) \u2013 Our teens assembled and distributed care kits for home-bound seniors in the neighborhood.\n\nUpcoming Charity Event \u2013 Saturday, March 15:\n\u2022 Working title: \u201cNeighbors in Action.\u201d It will be a day-long series of community-service projects including a neighborhood clean-up, visits to senior residences, and sorting donated goods.\n\u2022 Location: St. Mary\u2019s parish hall and surrounding community.\n\u2022 Volunteers: Parishioners, local residents and partners. We\u2019re anticipating around 100 participants.\n\u2022 Ways Helping Hands can join: It would be wonderful if your team could (1) host a short budgeting-for-families workshop and (2) help coordinate volunteer sign-ups at the registration desk.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Finalize the project schedule and workshop times.\n2. Confirm any materials or printed resources Helping Hands would like us to have on site.\n3. Begin joint promotion through our social channels and bulletin boards.\n\nCould we set up a 20-minute call early next week to go over details and assign point persons? Please let me know what time works best for you.\n\nThank you again for partnering with us to serve our community. I look forward to working together.\n\nBlessings,\nJohn\nSt. Mary\u2019s Parish",
