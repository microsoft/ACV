Hi Maria,

As promised, here are the steps you need to follow to gain access to the shared resources for your upcoming marketing project:

1. Verify your company login: Make sure you can sign in with your TechSolutions domain credentials and that your password is current. If you need to reset your password, please use the self-service portal.

2. Submit an access request:  
   • Go to ServiceDesk → “Access & Permissions” → “Shared Resources.”  
   • In the description, mention the project name (e.g., “2025 Marketing Campaign”) and the folder you need (\\fileserver01\\marketing-projects).  
   • Click “Submit.” The system will automatically route the ticket to your manager for approval.

3. Manager approval: Once your manager approves the request, it will be forwarded to IT Security for processing. You can track the ticket status in ServiceDesk.

4. Access provisioning: After approval, the IT team will add you to the "Marketing_Project_Share" security group. You’ll receive an email confirmation when this is complete (usually within one business day).

5. Map the network drive (Windows):  
   • Open File Explorer → “This PC” → “Map network drive.”  
   • Choose a drive letter (e.g., M:).  
   • Folder path: \\fileserver01\\marketing-projects  
   • Select “Reconnect at sign-in.”  
   • Click “Finish.”

   Mac: In Finder, hit ⌘K → “smb://fileserver01/marketing-projects” → “Connect.”

6. Remote access: If you’re working off-site, connect to the corporate VPN before mapping or opening the drive.

7. Verify access: Navigate to the folder “2025_Campaign.” You should be able to view, create, and edit files. If something is read-only, let us know—permissions propagate within 15 minutes after group assignment.

8. Need help? If you run into any issues, reply to this email with your ServiceDesk ticket number and a quick description of the problem. We’ll look into it right away.

Timeline reminder: According to the project plan, final ad copy is due by March 5 and media placements by March 15. If you need asset storage before then, aim to submit your access request today so everything’s ready on time.

Let me know if anything is unclear!

Best,
John
