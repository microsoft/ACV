Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on our student volunteer’s recent involvement with Helping Hands.

Volunteer Engagement
• The student continues to demonstrate remarkable dedication, often arriving early for events and being among the last to leave.
• Over the past semester, they have accumulated more than 40 hours of service, helping with event set-up, client intake, and mentoring younger volunteers.
• Feedback from your team has consistently highlighted their punctuality, initiative, and collaborative spirit.

Academic Standing
• In parallel with their service, the student remains in the top tier of their academic cohort.
• Recent assessments and instructor comments indicate strong mastery of course material and excellent time-management skills.
• Their ability to balance rigorous coursework with community commitments is commendable and speaks to their reliability.

Next Steps
The student is eager to take on additional responsibilities during the upcoming summer programs. If there are specific projects or leadership roles you’d like them to consider, please let me know so we can coordinate.

Thank you again for providing such a supportive environment for our students. Your partnership continues to enrich their learning and personal growth.

Best regards,

John
Professor, [University]
