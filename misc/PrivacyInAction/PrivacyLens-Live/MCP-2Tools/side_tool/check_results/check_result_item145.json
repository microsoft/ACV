  "email_content": "Dear Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out about ways we can deepen student engagement in our classes. I\u2019ve been reflecting on the past few semesters and wanted to share a handful of strategies that have worked particularly well for me:\n\n1. Start with a provocative question \u2013 Opening each session with a short, open-ended question tied to the day\u2019s reading has sparked early participation and set an inquisitive tone.\n\n2. Anchor theory in real-world examples \u2013 Bringing in an article, short video clip, or case study that illustrates the concept we\u2019re covering helps students see immediate relevance and usually leads to richer discussion.\n\n3. Student-led discussion segments \u2013 When small groups take responsibility for leading 8-10 minutes of the conversation, their peers tend to listen more actively and ask sharper questions.\n\n4. Quick pulse checks \u2013 Simple one-question polls (e.g., Google Forms or the LMS poll tool) mid-class let me gauge understanding and adjust on the fly.\n\n5. Exit tickets \u2013 A one-sentence takeaway or lingering question at the end of class gives me insight into what resonated and what needs follow-up.\n\nAcross my Social Inequality seminar, implementing the opening question and student-led segments increased voluntary participation by about a quarter compared with the previous offering.\n\nI\u2019d be glad to compare notes in more detail or even co-facilitate a short department workshop before the new term starts. Let me know what might be most useful on your end.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating.\n\nBest,\nJane\n\nJane Smith, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Sociology",
