Hi HealthTech Innovations team,

Thank you for partnering with Metro Health Authority on the new health-tracking platform. Below is the initial high-level information your developers requested so they can continue with system design.

1. Key Milestones
   • Initial system design due: March 15, 2022  
   • First prototype ready for internal testing: June 1, 2022  
   • Final implementation / go-live: September 30, 2022

2. Data Security Expectations
   • All data transmitted and stored must be encrypted using strong industry standards (e.g., AES-256 in transit and at rest).  
   • Quarterly security audits and penetration tests are required.  
   • Role-based access control: production data are accessible only to authorised Metro Health Authority personnel and approved contractors.

3. User Interface Requirements
   • Intuitive dashboard tailored for health-service officers to view aggregated metrics.  
   • Real-time analytics visible on the main interface.  
   • Customisable report generation for key health indicators.

Next steps
• Please confirm the milestone dates are feasible for your team.  
• Let us know any clarifications you need on the above points.  
• Once the NDA addendum is completed, we will share the detailed technical specification and data schemas through our secure file portal.

Looking forward to working together.

Best regards,
Jane Doe  
Public Health Service Officer  
Metro Health Authority
