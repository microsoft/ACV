Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance,

Thank you for sharing the updated accommodations list. I appreciate everyone’s commitment to creating an equitable testing environment.

Below is a concise summary of health-related considerations for next week’s exams:

1. One student needs extended time, a low-distraction setting, permission for water and a small snack, and seating near an easily accessible exit.

2. Asthma:
   • Students may keep inhalers with them and take a preventive dose before the exam if prescribed.

3. Anxiety/ADHD (per existing plans):
   • Reduced-distraction testing area and scheduled movement breaks as needed.

4. Severe food allergies:
   • Please maintain nut-free testing rooms for students with documented allergies.

Next steps:
• If you see any discrepancies or additional needs, let me know by Wednesday so we can update care plans promptly.
• I will share any individual emergency action plans directly with the specific proctors early next week.

Thank you for your ongoing collaboration in supporting our students.

Warm regards,

Jane Doe, RN
School Nurse | Oakwood Elementary
