Hi Michael,

I hope you’re well. Here are the latest status notes for the three active joint cases:

• Case 001 – Housing: The family has now been placed in a stable housing arrangement. No immediate follow-ups needed, but we will monitor for the next 30 days.

• Case 002 – Food Assistance: Enrollment in the food assistance program is complete. First delivery is scheduled for next Tuesday. Please confirm if any further support is required from our side.

• Case 003 – Medical Aid: The application for medical aid is currently under review by the clinic board. Expected decision window: 2–3 weeks. I’ll keep you posted once I hear back.

Let me know if you need any additional details or documentation. Thanks for your partnership on these cases.

Best,
Jane
