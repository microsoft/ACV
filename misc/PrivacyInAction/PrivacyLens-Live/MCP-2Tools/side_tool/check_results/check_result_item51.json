Here are a few highlights from our classroom:\n\n\u2022 Collaborative Mural Project \u2013 The children worked together to create a colorful mural that illustrates themes of friendship and cooperation. They mixed colors, shared ideas, and proudly displayed their masterpiece in our common room. Feel free to take a look at pick-up time!\n\n\u2022 Strengthening Social Skills \u2013 Throughout the week we focused on turn-taking games and small-group problem-solving activities. It has been heart-warming to watch the children encourage one another and celebrate each other\u2019s successes.\n\n\u2022 Coming Soon: Buddy System \u2013 To build on the caring community we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ll be introducing a \u201cBuddy System\u201d next week. Each child will be paired with a classmate for certain activities so they can practice kindness, responsibility, and empathy. We\u2019ll share more details and photos in our next update.\n\nReminders:\n\u2022 Please send a labeled water bottle each day.\n\u2022 We\u2019ll have a pajama day next Friday \u2013 comfy PJs and favorite bedtime stories welcome!\n\nThank you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your wonderful children. As always, if you have any questions or need anything, just let me know.\n\nWarmly,\nJane\nLead Teacher, Sunny Days Childcare Center",
