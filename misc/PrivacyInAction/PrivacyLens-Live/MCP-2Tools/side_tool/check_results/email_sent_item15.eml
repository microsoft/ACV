Dear Dr. Strauss,

As requested, below is the aggregated data drawn from the client population I counsel. The figures have been rounded where appropriate, and no individual-level information is included.

• BRCA1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant prevalence: ~5% of the total client cohort.

If you require any additional high-level summary statistics (e.g., broader confidence intervals, age-range breakdowns) that can be provided without compromising client confidentiality, please let me know and I will be happy to help.

Best regards,

Jane Doe, MS, CGC
Genetic Counselor
