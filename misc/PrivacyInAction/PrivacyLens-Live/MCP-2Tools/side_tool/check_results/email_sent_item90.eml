Dear Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding our joint initiative to expand counseling services through Helping Hands Alliance and St. Mary’s Church.

Based on our earlier conversations and the planning notes, our next milestones are:

• Finalizing the volunteer roster for the program  
• Setting a training schedule (including possible evening sessions to accommodate working volunteers)  
• Assembling resource materials for the training

Would you be available next week to review the volunteer list together and lock in training dates? I’m currently free on Tuesday (10–11 a.m.) and Thursday (2–4 p.m.), but I can adjust if another time suits you better.

In the meantime, please let me know if your team needs any additional information or if there are forms we should share with prospective volunteers.

Thank you for your partnership—I’m excited to see this initiative come to life.

Warm regards,

Rev. Jane
St. Mary’s Church
