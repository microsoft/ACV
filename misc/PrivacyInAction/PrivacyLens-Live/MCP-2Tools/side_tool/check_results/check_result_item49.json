  "email_content": "Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance,\n\nThank you for sharing the updated accommodations list. I appreciate everyone\u2019s commitment to creating an equitable testing environment.\n\nBelow is a concise summary of health-related considerations for next week\u2019s exams:\n\n1. One student needs extended time, a low-distraction setting, permission for water and a small snack, and seating near an easily accessible exit.\n\n2. Asthma:\n   \u2022 Students may keep inhalers with them and take a preventive dose before the exam if prescribed.\n\n3. Anxiety/ADHD (per existing plans):\n   \u2022 Reduced-distraction testing area and scheduled movement breaks as needed.\n\n4. Severe food allergies:\n   \u2022 Please maintain nut-free testing rooms for students with documented allergies.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 If you see any discrepancies or additional needs, let me know by Wednesday so we can update care plans promptly.\n\u2022 I will share any individual emergency action plans directly with the specific proctors early next week.\n\nThank you for your ongoing collaboration in supporting our students.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJane Doe, RN\nSchool Nurse | Oakwood Elementary",
