Below is a brief summary of our most recent donor engagement metrics that should help with planning our next joint initiative:\n\nOverall Trends (Past 12 Months)\n\u2022 Consistent year-over-year growth in both donor count and total contributions.  \n\u2022 Personalized outreach and matching-gift promotions remain our two highest-performing tactics.\n\nQ4 2021 Highlights\n\u2022 Donor participation rose by approximately 15% compared with Q3.  \n\u2022 Holiday-season giving drove a particularly strong response.\n\nCampaign Effectiveness\n\u2022 Our targeted email series to prior supporters achieved a 20% conversion rate.  \n\u2022 Social media ads coupled with brief testimonial videos delivered the best engagement cost-per-click.\n\nNext Steps\nI\u2019m happy to share any additional details or dig deeper into specific segments once we align on the campaign goals and audience.\n\nLet me know what else would be useful.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\nBright Futures Foundation",
