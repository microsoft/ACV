  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nThank you for submitting your project and for reaching out for feedback. Overall, your work demonstrates a solid understanding of the course material. I was especially pleased with the rigor of your data analysis and the way your visualizations supported your main findings.\n\nAreas that stood out:\n\u2022 Clear presentation and logical flow of results.\n\u2022 Appropriate choice of analytical techniques.\n\u2022 Effective use of graphics to illustrate key points.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\u2022 Sharpen the wording of your hypothesis so it is concise and directly linked to your research question. A tighter statement will help guide the reader through your argument.\n\u2022 In the introduction, briefly reference a couple of recent studies to situate your work in the broader literature.\n\u2022 When discussing limitations, consider adding one or two concrete ideas for future research to show how the project could be extended.\n\nYour overall grade for the project is B+. This reflects the strong analysis and presentation, along with the opportunity to refine the framing and focus of the hypothesis.\n\nIf you would like to discuss the feedback in more detail, feel free to stop by during office hours or let me know and we can arrange a meeting time.\n\nBest,\nJane\n",
