Hi Sarah,

I wanted to give you a brief internal snapshot of where our key matters stand ahead of next week’s partner meeting.

• Criminal Matter – Case #7643 (lead: John): We had a positive development last week when additional evidence was admitted, which is helping to refine our trial strategy. Discovery remains on track, and we are coordinating witness availability for upcoming testimony.

• Firm-wide Case Review: The scheduled review sessions will run February 7-11 in Conference Room B, starting 10 a.m. each day. Materials are being circulated and I’ll share the latest decks once finalized.

• Logistics & Next Steps: I’ll circulate a proposed agenda for the internal strategy call later this week. Let me know if there are other dockets you’d like covered or if you need any deeper dives beforehand.

Thanks and speak soon,
John
