Dear Mrs. Thompson,

At your request, this note confirms that Timmy is medically cleared to participate in all regular school activities. His immunizations meet current state requirements.

I can provide the official immunization certificate through the district’s secure health portal or by fax—please let me know your preferred method.

Feel free to reach out if you need anything further.

Sincerely,

Dr. Jane Doe
Pediatrician, Happy Valley Children’s Clinic
