Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m excited to share a brief overview of our most recent admissions cycle:

• Applications received: approximately 15,000 (up 5% from last year)
• Acceptance rate: 7%
• Incoming class size: 1,050 students
• Average test scores: SAT 1480, ACT 33
• Geographic diversity: students represent more than 60 countries, making this cohort one of our most globally diverse to date.

Beyond the numbers, this group stands out for its impressive leadership, community engagement, and intellectual curiosity. We can’t wait to welcome them to campus in the fall.

Please let me know if you’d like any additional details or if there’s anything else I can assist with.

Warm regards,

John
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Prestige University
