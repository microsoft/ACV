I have identified three elderly patients this week who could benefit from Helping Hands\u2019 programs:\n\n\u2022 One needs reliable transportation to frequent medical appointments.\n\u2022 Another requires transportation to therapy sessions.\n\u2022 A third would appreciate regular companionship visits.\n\nCould we set up a brief call or use the secure referral portal so I can share the specific details and complete any necessary paperwork?\n\nThanks so much for your ongoing partnership and support.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
