Hello Oakwood Owlets Parents,

I hope you are all doing well. As we get ready to launch our next class-wide group project, I’d like to make sure we have a clear plan for student collaboration and parent support. Your children will be working together over the next three weeks to investigate how local plants grow and to present their findings at our mini “Science Garden Expo.”

To keep things organized, here’s a quick overview of the timeline:
• Week of May 20–24: Students choose plant samples, begin observation journals, and discuss research questions.
• Week of May 27–31: In-class data collection continues; group poster boards drafted.
• Week of June 3–7: Final preparation and practice, Expo set-up, and presentation on Friday, June 7.

How you can help:
1. Supplies – If you have small gardening tools, seed packets, or empty 1-liter bottles that can be repurposed into mini-greenhouses, please let me know.
2. Guest Speakers – If anyone has experience with gardening or botany and would be willing to share a brief demonstration, the class would love it!
3. Poster Support – A few parent volunteers on June 4–5 to help with poster assembly would be greatly appreciated.

Next steps:
• Please reply with the area(s) you’d like to assist with by Friday, May 17.
• I will compile the responses and send out a finalized volunteer schedule and materials list.
• If you have other ideas, feel free to share — creativity is always welcome!

Thank you all for your enthusiasm and ongoing support. Working together, we can make this a fun, hands-on learning experience for our Owlets.

Warm regards,

Ms. Taylor
Oakwood Elementary – 3rd Grade “Oakwood Owlets”
