Community Member Seeking Counsel\n\u2022 One of our community members is looking for guidance on possible pathways to stabilize his situation and keep his family together. He has compiled his preliminary paperwork and is eager to speak with pro-bono counsel.\n\nYour assistance with an introductory consultation or direction to relevant application procedures would be invaluable.\n\n2. Resource Library\n\u2022 I maintain an up-to-date list of volunteer attorneys, legal clinics, and nonprofits focused on immigration matters. I would be happy to share it so we can streamline referrals and avoid duplicating efforts.\n\n3. Upcoming \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d Workshop \u2013 early March\n\u2022 Our coalition is hosting an evening session on immigrant rights led by volunteer lawyers and advocates. Your team\u2019s participation or feedback on the materials would strengthen the event.\n\nNext Steps\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like me to forward the resource list, schedule a quick call, or facilitate an introduction.
