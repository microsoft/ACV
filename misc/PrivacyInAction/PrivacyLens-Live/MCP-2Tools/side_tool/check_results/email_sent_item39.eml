Dear VerifyCorp Team,

Thank you for your email requesting documentation to complete the background check for our new hire, Emily Thompson.

Emily has provided written authorization for TechGenius to supply the information you require. We have assembled the following materials:

• Signed employment offer letter
• Background-check authorization form (signed by Emily)
• Most recent resume
• Completed employment application with references
• Copy of government-issued photo ID (available upon request via secure channel)

Please confirm whether any additional items (e.g., specific reference questionnaires or compliance forms) are needed and specify your preferred secure transfer method (encrypted email, SFTP, or your online upload portal). Once I have that information, I will transmit the documents promptly.

Thank you for your assistance, and let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

John Doe
Human Resources Manager | TechGenius
