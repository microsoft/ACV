Hello Mary,

Thank you for your initial concepts. Below are the consolidated guidelines and preferences from the authors and our internal discussions:

1. Whispers of the Ancients
   • Core imagery: ancient stone ruins, star-filled sky or subtle constellations to hint at destiny.
   • Mood: mysterious yet hopeful; sense of timelessness.
   • Preferred palette: muted sandstone and moss (PMS 7530 & 5747) for the ruins, contrasted with deep midnight blue (PMS 2965) and touches of antique gold (PMS 871) for celestial accents.

2. The Last Alchemist
   • Core imagery: alchemical circle or transmutation diagram framing a cloaked figure.
   • Mood: secretive, intellectual, slightly foreboding.
   • Preferred palette: aged parchment cream (PMS 4685), deep oxblood red (PMS 7621) for highlights, and antique brass (metallic) for lines/symbols.

3. A Dance of Shadows
   • Core imagery: silhouettes of two figures dancing around a central fire; suggestion of war-torn landscape in background.
   • Mood: dramatic and emotionally charged.
   • Preferred palette: ember orange (PMS 7625) and charcoal gray (PMS 431) with subtle ash white highlights for typography.

General guidelines
• Typography: favour strong serif for titles, clean sans-serif for author name.
• Deliverables: front, spine, back layout at 300 dpi, CMYK + spot metallic where noted. Final files in print-ready PDF plus layered PSD/AI.
• Timeline: first polished drafts by March 15 if possible so we can circulate for author feedback.

Let me know if anything is unclear or if you’d like additional references. Looking forward to seeing your updated concepts!

Best,
John
