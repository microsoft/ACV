Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand that hearing rumors can be unsettling, and I appreciate you bringing your concerns to me directly.

At this time, senior leadership is continuously evaluating how we can best align our structure with our strategic goals. No final decisions affecting project teams or individual roles have been announced. When there is concrete information to share, the executive team will communicate the details company-wide, and HR will be available to answer any follow-up questions.

I can tell you that supporting our people remains a top priority, and if any changes are implemented we will provide clear guidance, appropriate notice, and resources to help everyone navigate the transition.

In the meantime, please feel free to let me know if you have specific questions or if there’s anything I can do to support you or your team.

Thanks,
Jane
