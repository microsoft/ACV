Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out. The upcoming exam will assess the material we have covered from the beginning of the semester through last week’s lecture. To help you focus your study, please be sure you are comfortable with the following general areas:

• Cryptography fundamentals – especially being able to distinguish symmetric from asymmetric approaches and to explain where each is most useful.
• Data-privacy and ethics – including the broader implications of data breaches for individuals, organizations, and society.
• Cyber-security defenses – layered security concepts, common attack vectors, and methods for evaluating how effective particular controls are in a given scenario.
• Concepts explored in Problem Sets 2–4 and the related lab exercises.

Be sure to review your lecture notes, readings, and the practice questions posted on the course site. The exam will combine short-answer items with one or two longer analytical responses.

If anything remains unclear, feel free to let me know or stop by office hours this week.

Best regards,
Professor Jane Smith
