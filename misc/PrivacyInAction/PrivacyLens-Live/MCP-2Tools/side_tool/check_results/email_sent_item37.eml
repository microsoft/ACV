Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m excited to help shape this year’s Quantum Cohesion retreat.

From recent team feedback, two clear themes emerged:
1) People are eager for more creative problem-solving opportunities.
2) Many would like structured chances to strengthen cross-department communication.

With that in mind, here are a few activity ideas:
• Innovation ‘mini-hackathon’ – small mixed-discipline teams tackle a fun company-related challenge and present quick prototypes.
• Strategy simulation workshop – a game-style exercise where groups respond to a market scenario, then debrief on decision-making approaches.
• Communication role-play sessions – guided scenarios to practise giving and receiving feedback across functions.
• Outdoor team quest (e.g., escape-room-in-nature or ropes-course) to build trust and break routine.
• Reflect & reset corner – brief mindfulness or journaling blocks to help everyone recharge between high-energy sessions.

Logistics thoughts:
• Aim for a balance of high-energy and reflective blocks so all personality types stay engaged.
• Mix teams for each activity to encourage new connections.
• Capture takeaways in a shared doc so we can translate insights into day-to-day processes afterwards.

Let me know which of these resonate, and I can help flesh out the details or source facilitators. Happy to jump on a quick call this week to refine the itinerary.

Best,
John
