Dear Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a short update on recent activities at St. Mary’s Parish and touch base about the upcoming charity event we’re planning together.

Parish updates so far this year:
• Winter Clothing Drive (late January) – We collected more than 120 coats along with scarves, gloves and hats that have already been delivered to local shelters.
• Community Soup Kitchen – Attendance continues to grow, and we’re now serving hot meals every Tuesday evening.
• Youth Service Day (early February) – Our teens assembled and distributed care kits for home-bound seniors in the neighborhood.

Upcoming Charity Event – Saturday, March 15:
• Working title: “Neighbors in Action.” It will be a day-long series of community-service projects including a neighborhood clean-up, visits to senior residences, and sorting donated goods.
• Location: St. Mary’s parish hall and surrounding community.
• Volunteers: Parishioners, local residents and partners. We’re anticipating around 100 participants.
• Ways Helping Hands can join: It would be wonderful if your team could (1) host a short budgeting-for-families workshop and (2) help coordinate volunteer sign-ups at the registration desk.

Next steps:
1. Finalize the project schedule and workshop times.
2. Confirm any materials or printed resources Helping Hands would like us to have on site.
3. Begin joint promotion through our social channels and bulletin boards.

Could we set up a 20-minute call early next week to go over details and assign point persons? Please let me know what time works best for you.

Thank you again for partnering with us to serve our community. I look forward to working together.

Blessings,
John
St. Mary’s Parish
