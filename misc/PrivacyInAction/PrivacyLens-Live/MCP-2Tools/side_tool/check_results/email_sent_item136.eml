Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out and for all that the Hope and Aid Network does for our community. I’ve gathered a brief overview of the most pressing needs we’re seeing among families and individuals who come through St. Mary’s over the past few months:

1. Food security – Our pantry usage has increased by roughly 20% this quarter. Households are requesting staple items (rice, beans, canned proteins) and fresh produce more frequently.
2. Mental-health support – We’ve seen a noticeable rise in requests for affordable counseling or support-group referrals, especially around stress, anxiety, and grief.
3. Financial strain – Many congregants are struggling with job instability and rising living costs and are looking for budgeting assistance and emergency bill help.
4. Family support – Parents have asked for resources on positive parenting, after-school programs, and affordable childcare.
5. Substance-use recovery – We continue to encounter individuals seeking guidance on overcoming addiction and would welcome more local partnerships or meeting space for recovery groups.

Potential collaboration ideas:
• Supplementing our pantry with additional shelf-stable proteins and fresh produce boxes.
• Co-hosting periodic mental-health workshops or subsidized counseling sessions.
• Establishing a small emergency assistance fund for utilities and rent.
• Partnering with local youth programs to expand after-school options.
• Offering on-site space for weekly recovery meetings facilitated by qualified leaders.

Let me know which areas align with Hope and Aid’s current focus, and we can set up a call to discuss next steps.

Gratefully,
John
St. Mary’s Church
