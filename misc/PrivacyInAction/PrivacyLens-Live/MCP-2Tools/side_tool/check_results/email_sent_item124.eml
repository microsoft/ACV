Hi Emily,

It was great meeting you recently over coffee. As promised, I’m sending over a handful of ideas that my students and I work with in my creative writing classes at Oakwood University. I hope they’re helpful as you explore modern teaching approaches.

1. Show, don’t tell: Encourage writers to replace abstract statements (“She was nervous”) with concrete sensory details (“Her fingers tapped an uneven rhythm on the coffee mug”).

2. The five-sense checklist: After drafting a scene, have students highlight where they’ve engaged sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. Even sprinkling in two or three senses can ground the reader.

3. Character want vs. need: We map what a character thinks they want against what they truly need. Tension between the two powers the plot and keeps readers invested.

4. Dialogue eavesdropping: I ask students to transcribe snippets of real-world conversation, then adapt them into fictional dialogue. It helps them capture cadence and subtle conflict.

5. Revision as re-vision: We treat the second draft as an opportunity to “see again,” focusing on one craft element at a time— imagery pass, structure pass, verb pass—rather than trying to fix everything at once.

If any of these spark ideas, I’d be happy to chat further or share sample lesson plans.

Warm regards,

John
