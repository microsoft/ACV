Hi Sarah,

As discussed, I’m sharing the client data set you’ll need to craft the comprehensive tax strategy. The files are now available in our secure Sterling & Co. ShareFile portal. You can access them using your existing credentials at: https://sharefile.sterlingco.com/login

The dataset includes:
• Aggregated transaction summaries
• Prior-year return figures
• Key deduction category breakdowns

Let me know if you require any additional details or run into access issues.

Thanks,
John
