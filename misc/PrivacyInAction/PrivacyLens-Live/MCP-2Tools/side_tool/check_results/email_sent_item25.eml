Hi Team,

I’d like to share a few quick updates regarding our office environment and some workflow enhancements:

1. Office Renovation:
   • Starting next week, the ground-floor common work areas and break room will undergo renovation. During this period, all impacted employees will temporarily relocate to the upper floors.
   • Expect some intermittent noise; meeting rooms on floors 2–3 remain available for booking if you need a quieter space.

2. Ergonomic Upgrades:
   • Based on recent feedback, we’re ordering adjustable desks and monitor arms for workstations that need them.
   • Facilities will coordinate installation times directly with each team to minimize disruption.

3. Accessibility Improvements:
   • Live captioning will be enabled by default in our video-conferencing tools.
   • Meeting transcripts can be provided upon request.
   • Additional assistive technology options are being evaluated. If you have specific needs, please reach out to HR.

4. Quiet Zones & Noise Management:
   • To support focused work, we’re designating quiet-zone areas on the 3rd floor.
   • Please keep conversations and calls to a minimum in these zones.

5. Workflow Adjustments (Renovation Period):
   • Daily stand-ups can be held in hybrid format to reduce gathering sizes.
   • Remember to update project boards by end of day so remote participants stay in sync.

Thank you for your cooperation and for continuing to share your suggestions. If you have any questions or additional feedback, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
John
