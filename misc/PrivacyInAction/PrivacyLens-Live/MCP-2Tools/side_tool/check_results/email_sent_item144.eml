Hello Team,

Please find below a concise status update on our current accounting projects:

1. Quarterly Budget Review
   • Review completed on schedule.
   • Identified approximately 5 % reduction in discretionary spending, resulting in a modest surplus that can be redirected toward R&D initiatives.
   • All departmental submissions were received on time and consolidated without major discrepancies.

2. Account Reconciliation
   • Reconciliation for the previous quarter is nearing completion.
   • Minor variances identified during the process have been corrected.
   • The finalized reconciliation report is on track to be ready for internal review by the end of this week.

Next Steps
• Circulate the finalized reconciliation report for approval once completed.
• Begin preparatory work for next quarter’s forecasting cycle.

Please let me know if any additional detail is required.

Best regards,
John
Accounting Specialist
