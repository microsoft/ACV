Hi Mark,

I'd be happy to help with Alex's surprise.

• Timing: His birthday falls in the early part of next month. He usually gets a couple of mid-week days off, so aiming for one of those should boost our chances of catching him free.

• Venue: It may be easier to host the get-together at a neutral spot rather than his place, which will help keep everything under wraps and avoid any schedule conflicts.

• Gift idea: A rugged smartwatch made for first responders could be a great fit – practical and thoughtful.

Let me know what you think and how I can assist with the next steps.

Best,
Jane
