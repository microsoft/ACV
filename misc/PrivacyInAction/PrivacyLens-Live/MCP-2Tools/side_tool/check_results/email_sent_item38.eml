Dear Mr. Green,

Thank you for your email and your interest in tailoring EdTech Innovations’ learning modules to the needs of our students at Lincoln High School.

We are able to share aggregated, de-identified data that includes school-wide averages for recent assessments and overall participation rates in extracurricular activities. This information is consistent with our obligations under FERPA and district policy because it does not contain any personally identifiable student information.

Before we transmit the data, our district requires a signed Data Sharing Agreement that outlines the scope of use, data security measures, and retention schedule. I have attached a copy of the standard agreement for your review. Once it is executed, I can provide the most recent summary report (Spring 2025), which should meet the requirements you described.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the agreement or if there are additional metrics you would find helpful. I look forward to working together to support our students.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
School Data & Records Administrator
