Hi Ethan,

I hope you’re well. I’m excited to get started on the cover for Clara Bellamy’s upcoming novel, "Whispers of the Past." Below is our design brief and logistical info. Please let me know if anything needs clarification.

Design concept
•  Mood: mysterious and nostalgic, with a subtle sense of intrigue.
•  Key visual elements: an old ornate key and a faded handwritten letter. Feel free to experiment with layout, but these two items should be unmistakable.
•  Colour palette: muted earth tones (warm sepia, moss green, touches of antique gold). Nothing overly bright or saturated.
•  Typography: an elegant serif for the title and a clean sans-serif for Clara’s name. We’re open to your recommendations.

Specs & deliverables
•  Trim size: 6" × 9" (trade paperback).
•  Spine width: we’ll confirm once the final page count is locked (estimate 0.85" for now).
•  Formats: front cover, full wrap (front/spine/back), e-book cover (JPEG, 2560 px on the longest side), and a social-media teaser graphic.
•  Resolution: 300 DPI, CMYK for print; RGB for web versions.
•  File formats: print-ready PDF plus layered PSD or AI source files.

Timeline
•  Concept thumbnails (2 options): by Mon 27 May.
•  First full draft: by Mon 3 Jun.
•  Final approved files: by Fri 14 Jun.

Reference materials
I’ve attached the manuscript synopsis and Clara’s short bio for additional context. Let me know if you need anything else.

Budget & admin
As discussed, Griffin & Locke will issue a 50 % deposit upon approval of the chosen concept, with the balance payable on delivery of the final files. Please send your invoice when you share the first full draft.

Thanks, and I’m looking forward to seeing your ideas!

Best,
Jane
