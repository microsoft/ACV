I\u2019m currently working on an airport terminal expansion project and would value your seasoned perspective.\n\nFrom your experience, what high-level principles or lessons have you found most helpful when balancing structural integrity, passenger experience, and overall design aesthetics on large transportation facilities?\n\nIf you\u2019re available, I\u2019d love to schedule a brief call to discuss. I can share more details through an appropriate confidential channel at your convenience.\n\nThank you for your continued mentorship.\n\nWarm regards,\nJane\n\nJane Doe, PE\nAirport Design Engineer | ArchiFleet Solutions",
