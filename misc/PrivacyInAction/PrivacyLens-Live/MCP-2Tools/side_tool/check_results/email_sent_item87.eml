Dear University of Excellence Alumni,

I hope this message finds you well.

With admissions season in full swing, I’m pleased to share a quick snapshot of the incoming applicant pool:

• Total applications received: roughly 5,000 for the 2025–2026 academic year  
• Average SAT score: 1420  
• Average ACT score: 32  
• Applicants represent 100+ countries, underscoring our expanding global reach

The Admissions team is now moving into application review, and decisions will be released in late March. In the meantime, we’re coordinating a series of opportunities for alumni to support these future Eagles:

1. Virtual Q&A panels in February where admitted students can hear your real-world stories.  
2. One-to-one mentorship matches that pair an alumnus with an incoming student for their first year.  
3. Regional welcome receptions this summer.

If you’re interested in participating, please reply to this email or fill out the volunteer form here: [link].

Thank you, as always, for championing the University of Excellence and for the powerful example you set for the next generation of students.

Warm regards,

John Doe
