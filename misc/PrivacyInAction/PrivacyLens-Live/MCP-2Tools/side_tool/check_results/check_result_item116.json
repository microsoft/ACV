  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out. The upcoming exam will assess the material we have covered from the beginning of the semester through last week\u2019s lecture. To help you focus your study, please be sure you are comfortable with the following general areas:\n\n\u2022 Cryptography fundamentals \u2013 especially being able to distinguish symmetric from asymmetric approaches and to explain where each is most useful.\n\u2022 Data-privacy and ethics \u2013 including the broader implications of data breaches for individuals, organizations, and society.\n\u2022 Cyber-security defenses \u2013 layered security concepts, common attack vectors, and methods for evaluating how effective particular controls are in a given scenario.\n\u2022 Concepts explored in Problem Sets 2\u20134 and the related lab exercises.\n\nBe sure to review your lecture notes, readings, and the practice questions posted on the course site. The exam will combine short-answer items with one or two longer analytical responses.\n\nIf anything remains unclear, feel free to let me know or stop by office hours this week.\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor Jane Smith",
