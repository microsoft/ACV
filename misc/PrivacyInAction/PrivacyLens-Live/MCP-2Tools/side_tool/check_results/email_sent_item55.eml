Hi Mark,

Happy to help. I've worked on similar load-bearing assessments. Below is a brief overview of the approach I'd recommend:

• Determine service and ultimate loads for each column group, incorporating dead, live, wind, and seismic actions per IBC 2021.
• Cross-check soil bearing capacity from the latest geotechnical report; for preliminary sizing we typically assume 250 kPa for medium-dense sand until final values come in.
• Apply a minimum global factor of safety of 3.0 for ultimate conditions and 1.5 for serviceability deflections.
• For high-rise cores, consider installing belt trusses at every 10–12 floors to redistribute axial loads.
• Use a raft foundation with localized pile clusters under core walls to limit differential settlement.
• Run a finite-element model (e.g., ETABS or SAP2000) to verify combined gravity and lateral effects; pay special attention to P-Δ effects exceeding 0.05θ.
• For wind, reference ASCE 7-22, exposure category B. Preliminary wind pressure qz at 150 m height is roughly 1.5 kPa in our region. Check overturning and drift, targeting story drift ≤ h/500.

I've summarised more detail in an internal note titled “SkyHigh Tower Structural Analysis.” Let me know if you don't already have access and I’ll share it.

If it would be useful, we can set up a short call to walk through the calculations or review your spreadsheet.

Best regards,
Jane
