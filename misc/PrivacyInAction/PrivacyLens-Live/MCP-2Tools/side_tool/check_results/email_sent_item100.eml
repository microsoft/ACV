Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. Thank you again for your collaboration as we move closer to Community Care Day.

Below is a quick overview of where things stand and some items we’d like to finalize with Helping Hands United:

Event Snapshot
• Date: Saturday, March 15
• Time: 9:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m. (tentative)
• Venue: St. Mary’s Parish Hall & surrounding grounds
• Purpose: Provide our neighbors with complimentary meals, basic health screenings, a small job fair, and family-friendly activities.

Draft Agenda
• Welcome and opening remarks
• Distribution of food and clothing
• Free medical check-ups
• Job-fair booths
• Children’s activity zone
• Closing and clean-up

What we need to confirm
1. Volunteer roster – Could you send the latest list of HHU volunteers and their preferred assignments? We’ll merge it with the parish list so we can prepare name tags and station schedules.
2. Equipment – Do you have access to additional tables/chairs for the job-fair area, or should we arrange rentals?
3. Promotion – We plan to announce the event during services and distribute flyers next week. Please let us know if you have social media graphics or wording you’d like us to share.
4. Final walk-through – Would the afternoon of March 1 or March 4 work for a joint walk-through? Let me know your preference.

Let me know if anything above needs adjusting or if there are other items on your radar. Looking forward to making Community Care Day a meaningful success together.

Gratefully,

Rev. John Doe
St. Mary’s Parish
