Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on some of the folks we’re jointly supporting and the wider community efforts.

Michael:
• Completed his advanced welding course in the New Horizons Job Training Program with excellent results.
• Currently interviewing for positions related to his new skills and feels optimistic.
• Continues to make steady improvements in managing his personal budget and savings.

Community Programs:
• Attendance at our skills-training workshops has grown, and feedback has been encouraging.
• The recent collaboration between Unity Church volunteers and Helping Hands during last month’s outreach day was a big success; participants appreciated the one-on-one coaching and resume reviews.
• We’re planning another joint workshop in mid-June focused on interview preparation. I’ll send details once the date is confirmed.

Let me know if you have any questions or ideas for additional support. Thanks again for all you and the church are doing.

Warm regards,
John
