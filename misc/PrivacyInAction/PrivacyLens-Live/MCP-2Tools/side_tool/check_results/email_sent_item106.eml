Dear Brother Michael,

Thank you for your willingness to partner with me in supporting Tom as he works toward greater stability.

Tom has several job interviews lined up in the next few weeks and could really benefit from some practical assistance:
• Professional attire – particularly a suit, dress shirt, tie, and shoes.
• If possible, a small stipend or gas cards to cover transportation to and from interviews.
• Encouragement and moral support as he navigates this exciting but stressful period.

Would Light of Hope Church be able to help locate gently-used professional clothing in Tom’s size or contribute funds for this purpose? If so, I would be happy to coordinate pick-up or delivery.

I would also appreciate setting up a brief meeting or call (30 minutes) early next week so we can outline a joint plan and ensure our efforts complement each other.

Please let me know what day and time works best for you.

With gratitude,
Jane
Community Support Worker
