Dear InnovateX Hiring Team,

Thank you for continuing to consider my application for the Lead Developer position. I remain very enthusiastic about the possibility of joining InnovateX and contributing to your product roadmap and engineering leadership initiatives.

After researching current market ranges for senior/lead engineering roles and reflecting on my experience leading critical projects over the last several years, I am seeking a base salary in the range of $135,000 – $145,000 per year. I would also welcome the opportunity to discuss performance-based bonuses, equity, and benefits as part of a comprehensive package.

I am, of course, open to further conversation to ensure we arrive at a mutually beneficial arrangement. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me at this stage.

Thank you again for your consideration, and I look forward to our next steps.

Sincerely,
John [Last Name]
