Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well in beautiful France! It's been a hectic few weeks at the firm. I've been immersed in a complex intellectual-property matter for a young tech company, which has meant long hours of research, witness preparation, and a lot of strategic thinking. It's challenging but also rewarding to see how legal theory meets real-world innovation.

Another project is an environmental-compliance case that has me negotiating with regulators and learning far more about emission standards than I ever expected. The work is a crash course in balancing business realities with public-interest concerns.

In between, I attended an international seminar on legal ethics. The discussions about confidentiality and the lawyer’s duty to the court were a timely reminder of why we do what we do.

The main challenge lately has been time management: juggling multiple deadlines while still trying to squeeze in French practice! (Merci pour tes corrections, by the way.) I'm experimenting with a new planning system nicknamed “The Strategist”—a set of prompts I wrote in Notion to help me map out each case’s moving parts and stay ahead of surprises. It’s still a work in progress but already making my week feel less chaotic.

How are things on your side? Have you discovered any new cafés or books that you’d recommend? I’d love to hear all about your latest adventures.

À bientôt,
John
