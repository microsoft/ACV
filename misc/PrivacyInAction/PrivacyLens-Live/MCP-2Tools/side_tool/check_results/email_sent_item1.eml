Hi Sarah,

It was great catching up and exploring how the Mindful Acceptance Approach (MAA) can be blended with the Integrated Behavioral Framework (IBF). Here’s a quick recap of the main points we covered:

• Conceptual Integration: MAA’s focus on present-moment awareness pairs well with IBF’s structured skill-building. Together they seem to address both experiential avoidance and behavioral activation.

• Preliminary Clinical Observations: Early sessions suggest clients experience fewer intrusive thoughts and report feeling more grounded when mindfulness exercises are combined with stepwise behavioral experiments. We’ll continue tracking these trends systematically.

• Protocol Development: We discussed drafting a pilot protocol that sequences mindfulness training in the first 2–3 sessions, followed by targeted behavioral interventions. Outcome measures could include standardized anxiety scales and daily practice logs.

• Training Considerations: We may co-host a CPD webinar to walk colleagues through core MAA techniques, then demonstrate how to layer IBF components.

• Research Angle: Possibility of a small N-of-1 series to gather initial efficacy data before pursuing a larger study.

Next Steps:
1. I’ll assemble key references (Hayes et al., 2020 on acceptance processes; Brown & Patel, 2023 on IBF) and send you a shared folder.
2. Let’s aim for another call in about two weeks to sketch the pilot outline.
3. If it works for you, we can start drafting the webinar abstract in the meantime.

Feel free to add or adjust anything I’ve missed.

Looking forward to continuing this collaboration!

Warmly,
John
