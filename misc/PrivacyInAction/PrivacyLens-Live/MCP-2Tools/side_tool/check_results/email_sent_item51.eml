Hello Sunny Days Families!

We’ve had another wonderful week full of creativity, collaboration, and growth. Here are a few highlights from our classroom:

• Collaborative Mural Project – The children worked together to create a colorful mural that illustrates themes of friendship and cooperation. They mixed colors, shared ideas, and proudly displayed their masterpiece in our common room. Feel free to take a look at pick-up time!

• Strengthening Social Skills – Throughout the week we focused on turn-taking games and small-group problem-solving activities. It has been heart-warming to watch the children encourage one another and celebrate each other’s successes.

• Coming Soon: Buddy System – To build on the caring community we’re seeing, we’ll be introducing a “Buddy System” next week. Each child will be paired with a classmate for certain activities so they can practice kindness, responsibility, and empathy. We’ll share more details and photos in our next update.

Reminders:
• Please send a labeled water bottle each day.
• We’ll have a pajama day next Friday – comfy PJs and favorite bedtime stories welcome!

Thank you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your wonderful children. As always, if you have any questions or need anything, just let me know.

Warmly,
Jane
Lead Teacher, Sunny Days Childcare Center
