Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I’ve compiled some observations from my students’ participation in the “Read to Succeed” activities this semester and wanted to share them with you:

1. Overall literacy gains: Average reading comprehension scores increased by about 15% since the start of the term, and students’ critical-thinking responses in essays have become more nuanced.

2. Areas for improvement:
   • Resource access: A portion of students still struggle to obtain varied, high-interest reading materials. Expanding both physical and digital libraries would help.
   • Personalized support: Students benefit most when reading assignments are matched to their interests and skill levels. Developing a simple profiling tool or survey could guide differentiated reading lists.

3. Suggested next steps:
   • Partner with local libraries or publishers for book donations and e-book licenses.
   • Pilot small-group reading workshops led by trained peer mentors or volunteers.
   • Set up periodic comprehension checkpoints (short quizzes or reflections) to monitor progress and adjust support quickly.
   • Share success stories (with student consent) through the foundation’s newsletter to highlight impact and attract additional support.

Please let me know if these points are useful or if you’d like deeper analysis of any aspect. I’m happy to discuss further and collaborate on implementation plans.

Thanks for your continued partnership, and I look forward to advancing “Read to Succeed” together.

Best regards,
John
