Here are a few engagement insights and takeaways from recent analytics and debugging sessions that might help guide the UI work:\n\n\u2022 Average session length has risen by roughly 15 % over the past quarter after the dashboard layout update.\n\u2022 The new step-by-step onboarding tutorial improved week-one retention by about 20 %.\n\u2022 Users most frequently visit the \u201cAccount Settings\u201d and \u201cSecurity\u201d areas, so keeping those easy to find is important.\n\u2022 Whenever authentication or data-sync errors occur, we see a noticeable dip in engagement; adding clear, actionable error messages in the UI tends to prevent drop-off.\n\nBased on the above, I\u2019d recommend:\n1. Keeping critical actions (profile, security, logout) within two clicks from any screen.\n2. Using progressive disclosure so advanced options stay hidden until needed.\n3. Providing immediate, contextual feedback on form validation and sync progress.\n4. Watching performance budgets\u2014any page load above ~2 s correlates with roughly 25 % higher abandonment in our metrics.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to dig deeper into any of this or set up a quick meeting to brainstorm design tweaks.\n\nBest,\nJane",
