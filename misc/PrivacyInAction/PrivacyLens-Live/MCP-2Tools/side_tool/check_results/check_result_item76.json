I updated the macro outlook section and added a preliminary market-volatility chart (slide 7) using data through May 16.\n\n\u2022 Data refresh: Waiting on your revisions to include the latest market-trends report. Once we have that, I\u2019ll refresh the sector-allocation graphic and bullet points.\n\n\u2022 Design: Branding elements have been adjusted to align with the corporate style guide; I\u2019m waiting on final color-palette approval from the design team (expected tomorrow).\n\nNext steps\n\u2013 Incorporate your market-trends edits by EOD Tuesday.\n\u2013 Run through the deck together Wednesday afternoon (30-min rehearsal).\n\u2013 Submit the final version to the exec committee by Friday 11 a.m.\n\nEverything\u2019s on schedule for next week\u2019s presentation.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else.\n\nThanks,\nJohn",
