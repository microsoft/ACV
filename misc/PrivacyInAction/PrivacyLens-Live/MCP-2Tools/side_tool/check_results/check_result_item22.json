  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThanks for reaching out. Below is a concise, purely procedural overview that I\u2019ve found helpful when planning and filing motions in our state trial courts. Feel free to adapt it to your jurisdiction and the particulars of your matter.\n\n1. Confirm the Governing Rules and Deadlines\n   \u2022 Start with the local rules, standing orders, and any judge-specific practices.\n   \u2022 Double-check statutory or rule-based time limits that might shorten or extend the usual briefing schedule (e.g., motions for summary judgment often have longer notice periods).\n\n2. Consider Any Required Pre-Motion Steps\n   \u2022 Some divisions require a pre-motion conference or a good-faith meet-and-confer certificate before the court will set a briefing schedule.\n   \u2022 Document these efforts; many judges will strike a motion that lacks the required certification.\n\n3. Gather the Essential Supporting Material Up Front\n   \u2022 Identify the evidence you need (affidavits, exhibits, deposition excerpts) while you draft, not after\u2014it prevents last-minute scrambling.\n   \u2022 If you anticipate filing materials under seal, prepare a short, separate sealing motion so it can be ruled on before or concurrently with the main motion.\n\n4. Draft with the Court\u2019s Preferences in Mind\n   \u2022 Use clear, descriptive headings that track the elements you must establish or rebut.\n   \u2022 Keep the statement of facts short and cite to the record frequently; many judges read the fact section first to decide whether they need to dig deeper.\n   \u2022 Where appropriate, propose an order in editable format\u2014some judges expect one.\n\n5. Check Formatting and Technical Requirements\n   \u2022 Page limits, font size, and margin rules vary by division; a non-compliant brief can be rejected by the clerk before it ever reaches chambers.\n   \u2022 Confirm whether courtesy copies are required (and whether they need to be tab-bed or bound).\n\n6. File and Serve Strategically\n   \u2022 E-file as early in the day as practicable to avoid last-minute technical glitches.\n   \u2022 Arrange for prompt service on opposing counsel, especially if special service methods are required (e.g., certified mail for out-of-state parties).\n\n7. Calendar All Follow-Up Dates\n   \u2022 Build a mini-timeline that includes the opposition and reply deadlines, as well as any likely hearing date so the team stays ahead of scheduling conflicts.\n\n8. Prepare for the Hearing\n   \u2022 Circulate a short outline of anticipated questions and the key record cites that answer them; this saves time when the judge is pressing for specifics.\n\nThis checklist is intentionally high-level to preserve confidentiality, but I hope it points you in the right direction. If you need a sounding board once you\u2019ve mapped out your motion schedule, let me know and we can set up a quick call.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nCarter & Goldstein",
