Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in the child-welfare work we do at Haven Child Welfare Agency. I’m happy to provide a broad overview of our standard procedures as well as some of the systemic challenges our team encounters in the field.

1. Intake & Screening  
• Every call, email, or referral we receive is logged by an intake specialist who gathers the basic facts and completes a risk screen.  
• A supervisor then reviews the screen to determine whether the allegation meets statutory criteria for an in-person response, and assigns a response time (e.g., immediate, 24-hour, 72-hour).

2. Investigation / Family Assessment  
• A social worker visits the child’s home, interviews caregivers, the child (when appropriate), and any collateral sources such as teachers or medical staff.  
• We use standardized safety-assessment tools to document immediate threats and ongoing risk factors.  
• Findings are reviewed with a clinical supervisor before any removal decision is made.

3. Service Planning & Ongoing Case Management  
• When safety can be maintained in the home, we develop a family-service plan outlining steps such as parenting classes, substance-use treatment, or in-home supports.  
• If a child must be placed out of the home, we prioritize kinship placement and begin concurrent permanency planning.  
• Workers hold regular case conferences and court reviews until permanency is achieved.

4. Closure & After-care  
• A case closes only after documented evidence that safety concerns have been resolved or a permanent placement has been secured.  
• Families exiting our system are linked with community-based after-care services to help maintain stability.

Key System-Level Challenges  
• Caseload size: Front-line workers commonly juggle 25-35 open cases, limiting the time we can devote to each family.  
• Resource constraints: A shortage of foster/kinship placements and specialized mental-health providers often delays the services children need.  
• Workforce well-being: The emotional weight of the work contributes to turnover; recruitment and retention remain ongoing priorities.  
• Inter-agency coordination: Schools, courts, law enforcement, and medical providers operate on different timelines and data systems, which can slow down critical information sharing.  
• Community misconceptions: Public misunderstanding of CPS roles sometimes creates resistance that we must navigate before help can be delivered.

I hope this gives you a useful foundation for your story. I’m unable to discuss individual cases, but I can provide anonymized aggregate data or connect you with program leadership for additional context.

Please let me know if you’d like to schedule a more in-depth conversation or need clarification on any of the points above.

Best regards,
