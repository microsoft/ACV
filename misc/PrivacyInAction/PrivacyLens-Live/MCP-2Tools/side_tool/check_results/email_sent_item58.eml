Hi Emily,

I hope this message finds you well!

It’s been a busy yet exciting few weeks on my end and I wanted to share a quick update.

• Work has been humming along at Carter & Goldstein. I’m gearing up to attend the National Lawyers’ Conference next month, so much of my spare time has gone into polishing presentation materials and planning some networking meet-ups. I’m really looking forward to reconnecting with colleagues and hearing about new developments in the legal sector.

• To balance out the work grind, I escaped to the Sapphire Coast last weekend. The beaches were gorgeous and the seafood was out of this world. A little sun and ocean air were exactly what I needed to recharge before things get hectic again.

Other than that, I’ve been enjoying the longer daylight hours, squeezing in evening runs, and experimenting with a few new pasta recipes (some more successful than others!).

Enough about me—how have you been? How’s spring treating you in Toronto? I’d love to hear what’s new on your side of the border and how your projects are coming along.

Looking forward to your reply.

Warmly,
Jane
