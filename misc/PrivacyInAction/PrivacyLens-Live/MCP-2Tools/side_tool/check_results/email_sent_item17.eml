Hello MedTech Solutions Team,

I hope you’re doing well. As we prepare for the upcoming software update to the Greenleaf Health Center scheduling and management system, I’d like to outline a few operational needs and questions so we can ensure a smooth transition for our staff and patients.

1. Planned downtime
   • Could you confirm the proposed date and exact time window for the update?
   • We would prefer that any downtime occur outside of our peak patient-care hours (after 7 p.m. on weekdays or during the weekend) if possible.

2. Data integrity and backups
   • Please confirm the backup procedures that will be in place before the update begins and the rollback plan should any issues arise.

3. User roles and permissions
   • Will existing user roles and permissions transfer automatically, and are there any new security features we should prepare for?

4. Training and documentation
   • Our front-desk and clinical staff will need a short overview of the new features—especially the enhanced appointment-scheduling tools. Do you have a webinar, quick-start guide, or other training materials we can distribute in advance?

5. Testing environment
   • If a sandbox or staging environment will be available, we’d like access at least one week prior to go-live so we can validate key workflows.

6. Support during the update
   • Please provide the primary point of contact and escalation path should we encounter any issues during or immediately after the rollout.

7. Integration considerations
   • Are there any changes to API endpoints or data formats that could affect our downstream integrations? Advance notice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your partnership. Let us know if you need any additional details from our side. We look forward to working together to make this upgrade a success.
