Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out and for your concern about Eric.

I can confirm that Eric has been in contact with HR and has provided the necessary documentation to support his recent absences. His time away is currently approved as medical leave, and we are working with him to ensure he has what he needs to return successfully. I will keep you updated on his projected return date or if any workplace accommodations are required.

In the meantime, please continue to log his absences as excused. If you anticipate any coverage gaps or need additional support for the team, let me know and we can discuss interim solutions.

Thanks for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Jane
HR Manager
