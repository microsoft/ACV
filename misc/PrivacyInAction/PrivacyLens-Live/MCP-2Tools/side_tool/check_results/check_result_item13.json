  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As promised, I wanted to share a handful of general wellness tips you can experiment with over the next week:\n\n1. Mini-Mindfulness Breaks \u2013 Take 60\u201390 seconds a few times a day to pause, notice your breath, and gently bring your attention to the present moment.\n2. Stretch & Move \u2013 Set a reminder to stand up, stretch, or walk for a couple of minutes each hour to reduce muscle tension and refresh your focus.\n3. 4-7-8 Breathing \u2013 Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale through your mouth for 8. Repeat 3\u20134 times to help calm the nervous system.\n4. Digital Pause \u2013 Step away from screens for at least 5 minutes every couple of hours. Look outside, get a glass of water, or simply rest your eyes.\n5. Gratitude Check-In \u2013 At the end of the day jot down three things you\u2019re grateful for. This simple practice can boost mood and perspective.\n6. Consistent Sleep Routine \u2013 Aim to wind down at the same time each night with low-light, quiet activities so your body gets accustomed to a predictable sleep schedule.\n\nFeel free to let me know which of these suggestions resonate most, and we can explore them further in our next session.\n\nTake care,\nJane\nLicensed Therapist\n",
