Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise recap of our discussion at the Global Business Hub:

• Financial overview – confirmed recent funding inflow and reviewed last quarter’s expenditures; overall outlook remains strong.

• Strategic partnerships – identified target tech partners and aligned on timeline to pursue collaborations, particularly to support expansion into South American and Asian markets in the next two quarters.

• Q2 product launch – agreed on go-to-market actions including a digital-first marketing campaign aimed at our core tech-savvy SME audience; team is preparing detailed rollout calendar.

• Market landscape – briefly considered the potential influence of upcoming policy changes and reaffirmed our commitment to advocate for an open, innovation-friendly digital environment.

Next steps:
1. Finance team to circulate an updated budget forecast by Friday.
2. Partnerships deck to be drafted for your review by 25 Feb.
3. Marketing to deliver the draft launch timeline at next Monday’s sync.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you’d like deeper detail on any point.

Best,
John
