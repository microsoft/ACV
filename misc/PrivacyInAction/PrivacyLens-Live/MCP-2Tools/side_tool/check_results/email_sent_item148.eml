Hi Sarah,

Hope you’re well. I wanted to share a brief progress update on our joint community health initiative:

• Milestones: We’ve achieved roughly 70% of our Q1 targets, including attendance numbers at community workshops and screenings.

• Community engagement: Awareness and participation continue to rise. Feedback from participants has been encouraging, indicating real impact.

• Volunteers: Training sessions are scheduled over the next two weeks; materials are ready and will be distributed via our shared drive. This should keep volunteers equipped and on the same page.

• Next steps: As outlined in the strategic plan, we’re preparing to:
  – Expand outreach to additional underserved neighborhoods starting next month.
  – Seek supplemental funding opportunities; I’m drafting grant applications now.
  – Formalize partnerships with local clinicians to offer on-site preventive services.

Please let me know if you have feedback or additional priorities to include. I’m happy to set up a quick call later this week.

Thanks for your continued collaboration!

Best,
John
