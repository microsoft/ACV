Dear Mark,

It was a pleasure meeting you at the conference, and thank you for following up. Below is an overview of some of the key practices our university uses to help students thrive academically.

1. Differentiated Instruction
Faculty participate in ongoing professional-development workshops that promote varied instructional techniques—visual aids, hands-on activities, and technology-enhanced resources—so lessons can be tailored to diverse learning preferences.

2. Continuous Assessment and Feedback
Instead of relying solely on high-stakes exams, many courses incorporate low-stakes quizzes, short presentations, peer review, and reflective assignments. This provides students with frequent feedback and gives instructors real-time insight into where extra support is needed.

3. Early-Alert & Advising System
During the first few weeks of each term we monitor attendance, assignment submissions, and early assessments. Students showing signs of difficulty are proactively contacted by academic advisors who can connect them with tutoring, study-skills workshops, or faculty office hours before small issues become major hurdles.

4. Growth-Mindset Programming
Through first-year seminars and co-curricular events, we encourage students to view effort, persistence, and strategic help-seeking as pathways to mastery. This mindset training has proven especially helpful in courses that have historically high withdrawal rates.

5. Learning Analytics for Continual Improvement
Aggregated (and de-identified) course data are shared with instructors via dashboards so they can see patterns in engagement and performance and adjust their teaching accordingly.

6. Holistic Support Services
We pair academic initiatives with wellness resources such as counseling services, time-management coaching, and peer-mentoring programs to address non-academic factors that influence performance.

I hope these insights are helpful. If there is a particular area you’d like to explore in more detail—whether curricular design, faculty training, or the technical side of learning analytics—let me know and we can set up a time to chat.

Best regards,
Jane
