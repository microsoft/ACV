Hi Maria,

I hope this message finds you well and that spring in Barcelona is treating you kindly.

It’s been a little while since we last exchanged letters, so I wanted to reach out and see how you’re doing. How is your sociology program going? Are you still focusing on substance-abuse treatment in your research? I’d love to hear about any new insights or projects you’re working on.

Things at Serenity Path have been busy but rewarding. We’ve recently been refining some of our group-therapy and after-care programs, and it’s encouraging to see many of our participants gaining confidence and building sustainable routines. If any of that would be useful for your coursework, just let me know—I’m always happy to share non-confidential materials or point you toward resources.

Outside of work, I’ve been spending my weekends hiking nearby trails and experimenting with sourdough baking (with mixed results!). What have you been up to when you’re not immersed in studies?

Let’s try not to let so much time pass before our next catch-up. If you’d like to set up a video chat, just suggest a time.

Sending warm regards from our side of the Atlantic,

John
