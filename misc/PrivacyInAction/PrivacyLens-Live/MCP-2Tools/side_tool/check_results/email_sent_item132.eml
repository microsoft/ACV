Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the networking event and I appreciate you taking the time to follow up. I’m always excited to chat with people who share an interest in wellness and recovery.

About Serenity Path
Our mission is to help individuals and families build sustainable, substance-free lives through evidence-based treatment and whole-person support. We combine proven clinical methods with practical life-skills training so that recovery can continue long after a client leaves our campus.

A quick look at what we do
• Inpatient Residential: 30-, 60-, and 90-day tracks that include medical detox, individual therapy, group work, and daily wellness activities (mindfulness, yoga, nutrition, and exercise).
• Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP): Evening or weekend group sessions for clients who need structure while maintaining work or school commitments.
• Individual & Family Counseling: Licensed clinicians deliver Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, and 12-Step Facilitation, tailored to each client’s goals.
• Aftercare & Alumni Network: Weekly peer-led meetings, on-call coaching, and a mobile app for journaling, cravings tracking, and tele-sessions.

What’s working
Over the past 12 months, roughly 75 % of clients who completed our core 12-week curriculum reported maintaining sobriety six months after discharge. We attribute this to highly individualized care plans, early integration of family systems, and consistent follow-up through technology.

Key challenges we tackle every day
• Co-occurring mental-health conditions that need parallel treatment plans.
• Securing stable housing and employment for clients after treatment—critical for long-term recovery.
• Combating stigma and misinformation about addiction in the wider community.
• Adapting curricula quickly as new synthetic substances emerge.

Where collaboration could fit
Given your software background, you might be interested in:
1. Enhancing our mobile follow-up platform (adding behavioral-health content, improving data visualization, etc.).
2. Contributing as a guest speaker for our Saturday life-skills workshops (topics range from time-management to mindfulness practices for coders!).
3. Advising on data analytics projects that help us refine program effectiveness.

Next steps
I’ve attached a short PDF that outlines our programs and impact in more detail. If you’d like to talk further or arrange a tour of the facility, just let me know a few time slots that work for you and we’ll set something up.

Thanks again for your interest, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating.

Warm regards,
