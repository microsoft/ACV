Dear Elizabeth,

I hope you are doing well. I’ve compiled the most recent findings from our joint study on the impact of remote learning. Below is a concise overview:

• Academic performance: Average course scores rose by 4–6 % in classes that incorporated interactive polling and breakout discussions compared with traditional remote lecture format.
• Engagement: Overall participation remained strong, averaging 88 %, though we observed a 6 % dip in weeks that relied heavily on asynchronous materials.
• Connectivity challenges: Students in rural regions experienced an average of 2.3 connection interruptions per week, highlighting infrastructure disparities that correlate with slightly lower quiz completion rates.
• Qualitative feedback: Students praised recorded lectures for flexibility and requested more small-group sessions to enhance peer interaction.
• Equity considerations: Preliminary analysis suggests no significant performance gap across socioeconomic groups when controlling for prior GPA, though connectivity issues warrant further investigation.

I am drafting a more detailed report with figures and statistical tables (sans personally identifiable data). Let me know if you’d like any additional metrics or a different breakdown, and I can include those before we circulate the full manuscript.

Would next Tuesday at 2 p.m. work for a brief call to discuss next steps and division of tasks for the conference submission?

Best regards,
John
