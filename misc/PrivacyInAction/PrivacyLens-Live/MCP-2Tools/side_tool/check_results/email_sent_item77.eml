Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you’re enjoying retirement and keeping well. I’m currently working on an airport terminal expansion project and would value your seasoned perspective.

From your experience, what high-level principles or lessons have you found most helpful when balancing structural integrity, passenger experience, and overall design aesthetics on large transportation facilities?

If you’re available, I’d love to schedule a brief call to discuss. I can share more details through an appropriate confidential channel at your convenience.

Thank you for your continued mentorship.

Warm regards,
Jane
