Dear HR Team at Global Dynamics,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Jane, and I oversee recruitment for the Product Strategy group at Tech Innovations. We are currently in the final stages of evaluating John Smith for a senior position on our team, and he has listed Global Dynamics as his present employer.

To support our decision-making process, I would appreciate your assistance with a brief employment verification and reference. Specifically, could you please confirm:
1. John’s current job title and employment dates at Global Dynamics
2. A high-level description of his primary responsibilities
3. Any notable contributions or achievements you would be comfortable sharing
4. Whether he is eligible for re-hire in the future

From the information we have gathered so far, John is regarded as a proactive collaborator who successfully led the rollout of a new CRM platform that improved operational efficiency by approximately 25 percent. He has also received consistently strong performance feedback for his leadership on cross-functional initiatives.

Please feel free to reply by email or let me know a convenient time if a short call would be easier. I understand you may have internal guidelines for releasing employee information and will, of course, respect any policies or forms you require.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Jane
