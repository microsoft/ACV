Hi Alex,

As promised, here’s a consolidated overview of the technical information you asked for so Marketing can stay in sync with IT on the cross-departmental project. Everything below is cleared for internal sharing.

1. Platform stack
   • Application tier: containerised micro-services running on our internal Kubernetes cluster (current version 1.27).
   • Language/runtime: back-end services are primarily in Go with a small Python service for reporting.
   • Database layer: PostgreSQL 14 (High-Availability configuration) accessed through the service mesh.

2. Integration touchpoints
   • Primary REST API base path: /api/v1/project-sync/
   • Scheduled batch endpoint for Marketing data pulls: /api/v1/project-sync/marketing-import (available 00:15–23:45 UTC at 15-minute intervals).
   • Real-time webhook for campaign events: /api/v1/project-sync/events.

3. Authentication & security
   • All endpoints require JWT bearer tokens issued by our internal AuthN service (10-minute lifetime; renewable with refresh tokens).
   • TLS 1.3 enforced; only corporate-issued certificates are trusted.
   • Payloads are validated against JSON Schema 2024-02.

4. Data contracts
   • Marketing-to-IT payload: {"campaignId":string, "spend":number, "reach":number, "timestamp":ISO-8601}.
   • IT-to-Marketing payload: {"campaignId":string, "impressions":number, "conversionRate":number, "timestamp":ISO-8601}.
   • Max payload size: 256 KB.

5. Infrastructure capacity
   • Current provisioned burst capacity: ~700 RPS with auto-scaling to 1.5 K RPS.
   • Average latency p95: <120 ms internal; <250 ms external.

6. Deployment & testing timeline
   • Dev environment: already live—feel free to hit https://dev-gateway.internal/api/v1/project-sync for integration testing.
   • Staging: code freeze 10 May; promotion window 13 May.
   • Production: tentative go-live the week of 20 May, subject to final QA sign-off.

Let me know if you need additional details (e.g., field-level descriptions, sample payloads, or access to the OpenAPI spec). I can jump on a quick call or share the spec doc.

Best,
Jane
