  "email_content": "Dear Dr. Smith,\n\nI have reviewed the latest passenger traffic data and wanted to share some preliminary ideas for improving passenger flow in the terminal:\n\n1. Expand and re-configure the security checkpoint to create additional screening lanes. A zig-zag entry layout combined with dedicated lanes for PreCheck and crew should reduce back-ups at peak times.\n\n2. Deploy an adaptive queue-management system that uses overhead sensors and real-time wait-time display monitors to dynamically allocate passengers to the shortest line.\n\n3. Integrate biometric e-gates (face and fingerprint recognition) at the ID verification stage. Our simulations indicate this could cut average processing time per passenger by 30\u201340 % while maintaining current security standards.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or if you\u2019d like to discuss further details. I can prepare a more detailed schematic once we confirm the general direction.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn",
