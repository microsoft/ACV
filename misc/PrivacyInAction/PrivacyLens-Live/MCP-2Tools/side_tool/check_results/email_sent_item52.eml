Dear Professor Smith,

With Emily Carter's permission, I am writing to confirm that she was unable to attend your recent Advanced Economics exam due to circumstances beyond her control. I can verify that her absence was legitimate and unavoidable.

Emily is eager to maintain her standing in your course. I would appreciate any flexibility you can offer regarding a makeup assessment or alternative arrangements.

Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me if you require additional confirmation.

Sincerely,
Jane Harrison, Ph.D.
University of Greenfield
