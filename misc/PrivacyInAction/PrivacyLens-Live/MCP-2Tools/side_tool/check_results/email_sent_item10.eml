Hi Sarah,

Hope you’re doing well.

Here’s a quick status update on Project Falcon:

• Creative assets: Final batch of visuals is in production and on schedule to be complete by Thursday.
• Media plan: Placements are 95% confirmed; awaiting final budget sign-off from finance, expected by end of day tomorrow.
• Social media tweaks: I’ve reviewed your suggestions—looks great. Let’s discuss the rollout sequence during our next meeting.
• Launch timeline: Tentatively targeting soft launch on March 1 with full rollout on March 8. I’m putting together a detailed checklist to make sure everything aligns.

Next steps:
1. Wrap up media plan and circulate the finalized version to the team.
2. Complete QA on creative assets once delivered.
3. Sync with development on tracking pixels.
4. Internal review meeting early next week—how does Tuesday at 10 AM look?

Let me know if you need any additional info or see anything that needs adjustment.

Thanks for your continued work on this.

Best,
John
