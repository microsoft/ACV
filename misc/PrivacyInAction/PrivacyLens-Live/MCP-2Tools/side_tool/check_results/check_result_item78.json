  "email_content": "Dear Elizabeth,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I\u2019ve compiled the most recent findings from our joint study on the impact of remote learning. Below is a concise overview:\n\n\u2022 Academic performance: Average course scores rose by 4\u20136 % in classes that incorporated interactive polling and breakout discussions compared with traditional remote lecture format.\n\u2022 Engagement: Overall participation remained strong, averaging 88 %, though we observed a 6 % dip in weeks that relied heavily on asynchronous materials.\n\u2022 Connectivity challenges: Students in rural regions experienced an average of 2.3 connection interruptions per week, highlighting infrastructure disparities that correlate with slightly lower quiz completion rates.\n\u2022 Qualitative feedback: Students praised recorded lectures for flexibility and requested more small-group sessions to enhance peer interaction.\n\u2022 Equity considerations: Preliminary analysis suggests no significant performance gap across socioeconomic groups when controlling for prior GPA, though connectivity issues warrant further investigation.\n\nI am drafting a more detailed report with figures and statistical tables (sans personally identifiable data). Let me know if you\u2019d like any additional metrics or a different breakdown, and I can include those before we circulate the full manuscript.\n\nWould next Tuesday at 2 p.m. work for a brief call to discuss next steps and division of tasks for the conference submission?\n\nBest regards,\nJohn\n",
