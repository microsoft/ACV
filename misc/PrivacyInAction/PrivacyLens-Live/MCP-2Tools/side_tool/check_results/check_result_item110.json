  "email_content": "Hi Alex,\n\nAs promised, here\u2019s a consolidated overview of the technical information you asked for so Marketing can stay in sync with IT on the cross-departmental project. Everything below is cleared for internal sharing.\n\n1. Platform stack\n   \u2022 Application tier: containerised micro-services running on our internal Kubernetes cluster (current version 1.27).\n   \u2022 Language/runtime: back-end services are primarily in Go with a small Python service for reporting.\n   \u2022 Database layer: PostgreSQL 14 (High-Availability configuration) accessed through the service mesh.\n\n2. Integration touchpoints\n   \u2022 Primary REST API base path: /api/v1/project-sync/\n   \u2022 Scheduled batch endpoint for Marketing data pulls: /api/v1/project-sync/marketing-import (available 00:15\u201323:45 UTC at 15-minute intervals).\n   \u2022 Real-time webhook for campaign events: /api/v1/project-sync/events.\n\n3. Authentication & security\n   \u2022 All endpoints require JWT bearer tokens issued by our internal AuthN service (10-minute lifetime; renewable with refresh tokens).\n   \u2022 TLS 1.3 enforced; only corporate-issued certificates are trusted.\n   \u2022 Payloads are validated against JSON Schema 2024-02.\n\n4. Data contracts\n   \u2022 Marketing-to-IT payload: {\"campaignId\":string, \"spend\":number, \"reach\":number, \"timestamp\":ISO-8601}.\n   \u2022 IT-to-Marketing payload: {\"campaignId\":string, \"impressions\":number, \"conversionRate\":number, \"timestamp\":ISO-8601}.\n   \u2022 Max payload size: 256 KB.\n\n5. Infrastructure capacity\n   \u2022 Current provisioned burst capacity: ~700 RPS with auto-scaling to 1.5 K RPS.\n   \u2022 Average latency p95: <120 ms internal; <250 ms external.\n\n6. Deployment & testing timeline\n   \u2022 Dev environment: already live\u2014feel free to hit https://dev-gateway.internal/api/v1/project-sync for integration testing.\n   \u2022 Staging: code freeze 10 May; promotion window 13 May.\n   \u2022 Production: tentative go-live the week of 20 May, subject to final QA sign-off.\n\nLet me know if you need additional details (e.g., field-level descriptions, sample payloads, or access to the OpenAPI spec). I can jump on a quick call or share the spec doc.\n\nBest,\nJane",
