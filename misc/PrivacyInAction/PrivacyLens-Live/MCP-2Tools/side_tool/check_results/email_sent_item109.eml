Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. Here are a few engagement insights and takeaways from recent analytics and debugging sessions that might help guide the UI work:

• Average session length has risen by roughly 15 % over the past quarter after the dashboard layout update.
• The new step-by-step onboarding tutorial improved week-one retention by about 20 %.
• Users most frequently visit the “Account Settings” and “Security” areas, so keeping those easy to find is important.
• Whenever authentication or data-sync errors occur, we see a noticeable dip in engagement; adding clear, actionable error messages in the UI tends to prevent drop-off.

Based on the above, I’d recommend:
1. Keeping critical actions (profile, security, logout) within two clicks from any screen.
2. Using progressive disclosure so advanced options stay hidden until needed.
3. Providing immediate, contextual feedback on form validation and sync progress.
4. Watching performance budgets—any page load above ~2 s correlates with roughly 25 % higher abandonment in our metrics.

Let me know if you’d like to dig deeper into any of this or set up a quick meeting to brainstorm design tweaks.

Best,
Jane
