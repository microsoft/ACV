Dear Emily,

Thank you for your thoughtful message! It’s always lovely to hear from you.

Work update:
Things at the center have been busy but rewarding. We’ve recently wrapped up our annual review and were pleased to see that our programs continue to help a strong majority of participants sustain healthy, substance-free lives. It’s motivating for the team to see that the approaches we refine year after year are having a positive impact.

A recent highlight:
Earlier this spring we hosted a creative-arts therapy workshop where clients explored painting and music as ways to express their recovery journeys. Watching people discover fresh ways to tell their stories was truly moving.

Life outside work:
Spring has arrived here, so I’ve been spending weekends planting herbs on the balcony and attempting to learn the mandolin. The mint is thriving; the mandolin skills… still a work in progress!

How are things in Eldoria? I’d love to hear about any festivals or new favorite recipes you’ve discovered.

Warm hugs across the miles,
Jane
