Hi Tom,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on our community program’s current situation and recent activities:

Community Engagement
• Reached out to 45 individuals this month, connecting them with resources and support.
• Attendance at our weekly support meetings is up by roughly 20%.

Program Outcomes
• In the past month, 12 participants have begun their rehabilitation journey through Path to Sobriety.

Outreach & Education
• Hosted three substance-abuse awareness and prevention workshops; feedback from attendees was very positive.

Partnership Opportunities
• We’re planning a community outreach fair for next month and would love Hope and Recovery Network’s input and presence.
• We’re also drafting a joint volunteer-training session for late June to ensure our teams are aligned.

Funding & Resources
• We’re submitting a local grant application next week aimed at expanding peer-mentorship sessions. I’ll keep you posted on any developments.

Next Steps
Would you have 15–20 minutes early next week for a quick call to coordinate summer initiatives?

Thank you for your continued partnership and support.

Best regards,
Jane
Alcohol & Drug Abuse Assistance Coordinator
