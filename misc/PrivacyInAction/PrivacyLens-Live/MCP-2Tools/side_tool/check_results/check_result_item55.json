  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nHappy to help. I've worked on similar load-bearing assessments. Below is a brief overview of the approach I'd recommend:\n\n\u2022 Determine service and ultimate loads for each column group, incorporating dead, live, wind, and seismic actions per IBC 2021.\n\u2022 Cross-check soil bearing capacity from the latest geotechnical report; for preliminary sizing we typically assume 250 kPa for medium-dense sand until final values come in.\n\u2022 Apply a minimum global factor of safety of 3.0 for ultimate conditions and 1.5 for serviceability deflections.\n\u2022 For high-rise cores, consider installing belt trusses at every 10\u201312 floors to redistribute axial loads.\n\u2022 Use a raft foundation with localized pile clusters under core walls to limit differential settlement.\n\u2022 Run a finite-element model (e.g., ETABS or SAP2000) to verify combined gravity and lateral effects; pay special attention to P-\u0394 effects exceeding 0.05\u03b8.\n\u2022 For wind, reference ASCE 7-22, exposure category B. Preliminary wind pressure qz at 150 m height is roughly 1.5 kPa in our region. Check overturning and drift, targeting story drift \u2264 h/500.\n\nI've summarised more detail in an internal note titled \u201cSkyHigh Tower Structural Analysis.\u201d Let me know if you don't already have access and I\u2019ll share it.\n\nIf it would be useful, we can set up a short call to walk through the calculations or review your spreadsheet.\n\nBest regards,\nJane",

    "Camera Coverage: The facility is outfitted with a network of high-definition, night vision cameras. Coverage includes all entrances and exits, common areas, hallways, and critical infrastructure points. Cameras are also positioned to monitor the perimeter fence, parking areas, and loading docks.",
    "Service and Delivery Entrance: Monitored via CCTV and secured with a combination of keycard access and vehicle recognition systems. All deliveries are logged and inspected.",
    "Central Monitoring Room: All camera feeds are monitored in real-time by a dedicated team in the central security room. The system is equipped with motion detection and automatic alert protocols to notify security personnel of any unusual activity.",
    "Restricted Areas: Access to sensitive areas, such as the research and development wing, is controlled through advanced biometric authentication, including fingerprint and retinal scans, to ensure that only specifically authorized staff can enter these zones.",
    "Main Entrance: Equipped with biometric scanners and RFID badge readers to ensure that only authorized personnel can enter the facility. A 24/7 security checkpoint is staffed by trained security officers.",
