   - Sprint velocity: avg 115 story points per sprint (Q4 baseline 108)

   Digital Marketing

   These averages remain within the mid-market range per latest Mercer benchmarks (50th–55th percentile).

3. Budget Utilization & Forecast (FY2025)
   Software Dev

   - YTD spend: $1.03M (41%)
     • Payroll & benefits: $0.78M
     • Operational costs: $0.25M
   - Forecasted year-end variance: +$0.12M under budget, largely from deferred contractor spend.

4. Upcoming Actions & Recommendations
   • Software Dev: Consider reallocating projected surplus to accelerate QA automation initiative (~$90k).
   • Digital Marketing: Opportunity to pilot ABM platform in Q3 using identified surplus (~$40k) without exceeding allocation.
   • Both departments: Submit any mid-year hiring requests by 20 Jun so Finance can adjust headcount models.

Let me know if you'd like deeper drill-downs or dashboards.
