Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some preliminary findings on the effectiveness of the revised curriculum we implemented this semester.

Key highlights:
• Overall average student grades improved by about 12% compared with last semester.
• Students demonstrated stronger critical thinking and application of concepts in their assessments.
• Engagement in practical projects increased, with more students meeting or exceeding expected benchmarks.
• Areas for further enhancement include encouraging consistent participation in group discussions and providing extra support for advanced topics.

Next steps I’m planning:
• Conducting a focus group to gather qualitative feedback from students.
• Reviewing assessment rubrics to ensure full alignment with our learning objectives.
• Planning targeted support sessions to help students solidify advanced concepts.

Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any of these points or to discuss how we can leverage these insights for our joint initiatives.

Best regards,
John
