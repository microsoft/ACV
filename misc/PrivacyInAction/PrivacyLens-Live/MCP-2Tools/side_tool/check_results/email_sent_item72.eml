Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share the key details we have locked in for the Helping Hands Foundation Charity Gala so we can move forward with the next steps:

Date: Saturday, March 5th, 2022
Time: 6:00 PM – 11:00 PM
Venue: Grand Ballroom, Metropolitan Hotel
Guest Speaker: Mr. Thomas Anderson (confirmed)
Planned Program: Welcome reception, silent auction, dinner service, keynote address, live music set, and award ceremony.

Next Steps / Action Items:
1. Volunteer Assignments – Could you please send me the current volunteer roster? I’ll coordinate arrival times and role descriptions once I have it.
2. Final Guest List – Our RSVP deadline is coming up on February 18th. Let’s aim to exchange our latest counts by next Wednesday so we can send reminders where needed.
3. Auction Items – I’m finalizing a short list of high-value items that the bank is donating. Let me know if you have any additional pledges that need spotlights in the catalog.
4. Press & Promotion – I’ll draft a joint press release highlighting the purpose of the gala and Mr. Anderson’s participation. If you have approved language or sponsor acknowledgments, please forward them.
5. On-Site Run-through – Are you available the afternoon of March 4th for a quick rehearsal and tech check at the venue? It would be helpful to walk through timing and stage cues together.

Let me know if there’s anything I missed or if you have questions. I’m looking forward to another successful event.

Best regards,
Jane
