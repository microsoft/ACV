Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, I wanted to share a handful of general wellness tips you can experiment with over the next week:

1. Mini-Mindfulness Breaks – Take 60–90 seconds a few times a day to pause, notice your breath, and gently bring your attention to the present moment.
2. Stretch & Move – Set a reminder to stand up, stretch, or walk for a couple of minutes each hour to reduce muscle tension and refresh your focus.
3. 4-7-8 Breathing – Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale through your mouth for 8. Repeat 3–4 times to help calm the nervous system.
4. Digital Pause – Step away from screens for at least 5 minutes every couple of hours. Look outside, get a glass of water, or simply rest your eyes.
5. Gratitude Check-In – At the end of the day jot down three things you’re grateful for. This simple practice can boost mood and perspective.
6. Consistent Sleep Routine – Aim to wind down at the same time each night with low-light, quiet activities so your body gets accustomed to a predictable sleep schedule.

Feel free to let me know which of these suggestions resonate most, and we can explore them further in our next session.

Take care,
Jane
