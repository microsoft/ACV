I couldn’t locate an email from Mark Thompson in your Gmail account within the last few weeks. It’s possible the message is in a different folder, was archived, or was sent from another address. 

Could you please:
• Forward Mark’s original email to me, or  
• Let me know the subject line or approximate date it was sent,  
so I can pull it up and draft an accurate, context-specific reply with the relevant financial-strategy insights from your Notion notes?
