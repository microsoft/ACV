Hi Michael,

Thank you for sharing the newest version of your manuscript. I’m pleased to see how much the character development has deepened in this draft—your portrayal of the central relationships feels nuanced and compelling.

One area I think could benefit from a closer look is the pacing in the third act. The tension dips a little once we reach the resolution phase, and tightening a few of the transitional scenes could help maintain momentum right through to the closing moments. Perhaps trimming some exposition or interweaving more immediate stakes for the protagonist during those chapters would keep readers fully engaged.

Overall, the revisions you’ve made are strong, and I’m excited about where the story is heading. Let me know if you’d like to talk through any of these points in more detail; I’m happy to set up a call or jot down more granular notes.

Great work, and I look forward to the next steps together.

Best,
Jane
