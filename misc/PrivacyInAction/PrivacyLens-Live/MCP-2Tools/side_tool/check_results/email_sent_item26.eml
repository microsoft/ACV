Hi Ms. Richardson,

I wanted to share a brief progress update on the Zenith Wellness Initiative:

• Participation has climbed to 78% (up 5% since the last report).
• Average weekly gym check-ins have increased by 12%.
• Our four-part nutrition webinar series wrapped up last Friday with a total attendance of 85 employees and an average satisfaction score of 4.6/5.
• The stress-management pilot workshop kicked off last week; early feedback from attendees has been very positive and we’re compiling a summary of suggestions for the next session.
• Preliminary aggregated health metrics indicate modest reductions in average weight and better-controlled blood pressure among participants.
• Looking ahead: we’re finalising a Mental Health Awareness campaign for next month and firming up a partnership with HealthyBite to provide subsidised meal-planning services.

I’m putting the full data dashboard together and will have it ready for your review by the end of the week. Please let me know if you’d like any additional details in the meantime.

Best regards,
John
