Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you! Thanks for asking what my workdays look like at Sterling & Locke.

Most mornings begin with a quick review of client portfolios to see if anything needs attention. Later in the morning our team has a brief catch-up where we talk through any notable industry updates before everyone heads off to individual projects. The bulk of my day is spent wrangling numbers—updating reports, preparing statements, and making sure everything balances. It can feel like detective work, which I really enjoy.

Afternoons are usually reserved for putting together materials for upcoming meetings and occasionally speaking with clients to walk them through their financial reports. Before I log off I jot down a to-do list for the next day so nothing slips through the cracks.

Beyond the tasks themselves, I appreciate the collaborative culture here. Colleagues are generous with advice, which has helped me grow professionally.

How are things on your end? Any new projects or community events keeping you busy?

Warmly,
Jane
