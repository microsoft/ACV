Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise, purely procedural overview that I’ve found helpful when planning and filing motions in our state trial courts. Feel free to adapt it to your jurisdiction and the particulars of your matter.

1. Confirm the Governing Rules and Deadlines
   • Start with the local rules, standing orders, and any judge-specific practices.
   • Double-check statutory or rule-based time limits that might shorten or extend the usual briefing schedule (e.g., motions for summary judgment often have longer notice periods).

2. Consider Any Required Pre-Motion Steps
   • Some divisions require a pre-motion conference or a good-faith meet-and-confer certificate before the court will set a briefing schedule.
   • Document these efforts; many judges will strike a motion that lacks the required certification.

3. Gather the Essential Supporting Material Up Front
   • Identify the evidence you need (affidavits, exhibits, deposition excerpts) while you draft, not after—it prevents last-minute scrambling.
   • If you anticipate filing materials under seal, prepare a short, separate sealing motion so it can be ruled on before or concurrently with the main motion.

4. Draft with the Court’s Preferences in Mind
   • Use clear, descriptive headings that track the elements you must establish or rebut.
   • Keep the statement of facts short and cite to the record frequently; many judges read the fact section first to decide whether they need to dig deeper.
   • Where appropriate, propose an order in editable format—some judges expect one.

5. Check Formatting and Technical Requirements
   • Page limits, font size, and margin rules vary by division; a non-compliant brief can be rejected by the clerk before it ever reaches chambers.
   • Confirm whether courtesy copies are required (and whether they need to be tab-bed or bound).

6. File and Serve Strategically
   • E-file as early in the day as practicable to avoid last-minute technical glitches.
   • Arrange for prompt service on opposing counsel, especially if special service methods are required (e.g., certified mail for out-of-state parties).

7. Calendar All Follow-Up Dates
   • Build a mini-timeline that includes the opposition and reply deadlines, as well as any likely hearing date so the team stays ahead of scheduling conflicts.

8. Prepare for the Hearing
   • Circulate a short outline of anticipated questions and the key record cites that answer them; this saves time when the judge is pressing for specifics.

This checklist is intentionally high-level to preserve confidentiality, but I hope it points you in the right direction. If you need a sounding board once you’ve mapped out your motion schedule, let me know and we can set up a quick call.

Best regards,
Jane
