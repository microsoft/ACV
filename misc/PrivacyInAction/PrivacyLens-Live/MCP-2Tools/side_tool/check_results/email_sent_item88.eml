Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well! As we look ahead to the next quarter, I'd love to explore ways our two organizations can work together to amplify donations and deepen community engagement.

A few initial ideas I've been jotting down:

• Launch a “Steps for Change” virtual marathon where participants log miles over the course of a week and secure peer-to-peer pledges.
• Host an online benefit concert featuring local artists; we could stream it on social platforms and encourage micro-donations throughout the show.
• Curate a community art auction showcasing pieces from neighborhood creators, with proceeds shared between our missions.
• Leverage corporate matching-gift programs; we can jointly create a simple toolkit that employers can share internally.

If these resonate, perhaps we could schedule a brief brainstorming call early next week. Let me know times that might work on your end, and I’ll do my best to accommodate.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Warmly,
John
Hope and Growth Foundation
