Hi Mark,

Here are the latest updates on our project:

• Encryption algorithm debugged: I traced the issue with the shareholder data encryption to an incorrect IV length. Updated the AES256-GCM implementation and added regression tests. All unit tests passing.

• Client-side integration: The new endpoint now returns encrypted payloads with the proper metadata. Let me know if you need sample payloads for your implementation.

• Performance: I ran benchmarks; encryption adds ~12ms per request (within our 15ms budget).

• Next steps:
   – Could you integrate the updated SDK into the client app and run end-to-end tests?
   – I'll start working on automated key rotation routines, target completion by Friday.

Let me know if anything looks off.

Thanks,
Jane
