Hello MedTech Innovations team,

Thank you for the opportunity to pilot your new patient-management system at Harmony Health Clinic. Overall, our team finds the interface intuitive and easy to navigate, and we've already observed measurable gains in workflow efficiency and patient outcome tracking.

To help you refine the product further, I wanted to share a few observations:

1. Scheduling flexibility: The current medication/therapy scheduling module offers only standard repeat patterns (daily, weekly, monthly). Many of our patients follow complex therapy and medication plans that require irregular intervals and quick adjustments. Allowing users to define custom recurrence rules (e.g., “every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday” or “every 10 days”) and to edit existing schedules without recreating them would reduce administrative work and potential errors.

2. Batch updates & overrides: When a clinician modifies one element of a patient’s plan (e.g., dose or session duration) it would be helpful if the system could automatically propagate the change to future occurrences or let the user select which events to update.

3. Outcome analytics: We appreciate the built-in reporting dashboards. Adding configurable analytics—such as trend lines for symptom scores, therapy adherence rates, and customizable time windows—would give clinicians quicker insight into treatment effectiveness.

4. Performance improvements: Occasionally, page loads in the scheduling view take several seconds during peak clinic hours. Optimizing this could improve the user experience.

We value our collaboration and are happy to discuss these points in more detail or participate in future usability testing.

Thank you for your continued support.
