Hi Sarah,

Just a quick status update on our investment-strategy presentation:

• Content & slides: Core structure is complete (20 slides). I updated the macro outlook section and added a preliminary market-volatility chart (slide 7) using data through May 16.

• Data refresh: Waiting on your revisions to include the latest market-trends report. Once we have that, I’ll refresh the sector-allocation graphic and bullet points.

• Design: Branding elements have been adjusted to align with the corporate style guide; I’m waiting on final color-palette approval from the design team (expected tomorrow).

Next steps
– Incorporate your market-trends edits by EOD Tuesday.
– Run through the deck together Wednesday afternoon (30-min rehearsal).
– Submit the final version to the exec committee by Friday 11 a.m.

Everything’s on schedule for next week’s presentation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
John
