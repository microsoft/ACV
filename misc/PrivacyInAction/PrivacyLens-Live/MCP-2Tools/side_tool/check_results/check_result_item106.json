If so, I would be happy to coordinate pick-up or delivery.\n\nI would also appreciate setting up a brief meeting or call (30 minutes) early next week so we can outline a joint plan and ensure our efforts complement each other.\n\nPlease let me know what day and time works best for you.\n\nWith gratitude,\nJane\nCommunity Support Worker",
