Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for the kind words about my advocacy work. I would be honored to contribute to Vital Voices and help further the conversation around HIV awareness and destigmatization.

I’m comfortable either writing a guest article or taking part in an interview—whichever best fits your editorial calendar. If an article is preferable, I could deliver a draft of roughly 1,200–1,500 words within the next two weeks. If you’d prefer an interview, I’m available for a video or phone call on Tuesday or Thursday mornings (EST) next week; please let me know what works on your end.

Some of the themes I can address include:
• The importance of early testing and regular check-ups.
• Strategies for combating stigma in everyday life.
• The role of consistent treatment and wrap-around support services.
• Empowering people living with HIV to share their stories.

Feel free to share any specific guidelines, word limits, or questions you’d like me to cover so I can tailor the content for your audience.

Thank you again for the invitation. I’m excited about the possibility of collaborating with Vital Voices.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
HIV Advocate & Speaker
