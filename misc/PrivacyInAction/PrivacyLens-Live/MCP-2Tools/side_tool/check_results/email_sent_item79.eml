Hi Carlos,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, here’s a concise guide you can share with New Horizons members who are looking to establish or strengthen their credit profiles in the United States.

1. Start with a secured credit card
   • Many banks and credit unions offer these cards. A refundable cash deposit (often $200–$500) becomes the credit limit. Making small purchases and paying the balance in full each month establishes a positive payment history.

2. Explore credit-builder loans
   • Community banks and credit unions frequently provide small installment loans ($300–$1,000) that are held in a locked savings account while you make monthly payments. Each on-time payment is reported to the credit bureaus and builds credit history. At the end of the term, borrowers receive the accumulated savings.

3. Become an authorized user on a trusted person’s card
   • If a family member or close friend has a well-managed credit card (low balance, solid payment history), being added as an authorized user can help transmit that positive history to the newcomer’s credit file. Make sure the primary cardholder’s habits are responsible.

4. Report non-traditional payments
   • Services such as Experian Boost, LevelCredit, or rent-reporting programs can add on-time rent, utility, and phone payments to a credit file, providing extra data points for thin or new credit reports.

5. Practice healthy utilization and payment habits
   • Keep credit card balances below 30% of the limit (below 10% is even better).
   • Set up automatic payments or calendar reminders to avoid missed payments – payment history is the largest factor in credit scores.

6. Monitor credit regularly
   • Everyone is entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major bureaus annually at AnnualCreditReport.com. Reviewing reports helps catch errors or fraud early.

Helpful Resources
• Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) – “Building or Repairing Your Credit” guide
• NerdWallet & Bankrate – up-to-date lists of secured cards and credit-builder loans
• Local credit unions – often have multilingual staff and newcomer-friendly products

I’m happy to answer questions or set up a brief workshop if that would benefit your members.

Best regards,
