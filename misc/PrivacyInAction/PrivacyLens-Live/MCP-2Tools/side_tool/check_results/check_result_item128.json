  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nHere are the key details you asked for to complete the Q2 budget forecast:\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re projecting roughly a 5% increase in raw-material costs in Q2, driven largely by market volatility in metals and specialty plastics.\n\u2022 Negotiated price lists for all core components have been updated; these figures are summarized in the spreadsheet I\u2019ve placed in the shared drive (Path: Team_Shared/Finance/Budget_Forecast/Q2_Budget_Forecast_Summary.xlsx).\n\u2022 A shift toward more sustainable materials is planned. Current estimates show a 2\u20133% cost premium, though potential ESG credits could offset a portion of that.\n\u2022 Contract renegotiations with three key suppliers are under way and expected to close by mid-June. The forecast assumes the draft terms remain intact.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to walk through any of the assumptions or if you need additional scenario analyses. (I\u2019ve kept the supplier-portal credentials and other purchasing-only details out of this summary; we can review them together if necessary.)\n\nThanks,\nJane",
