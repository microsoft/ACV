As we get ready to launch our next class-wide group project, I\u2019d like to make sure we have a clear plan for student collaboration and parent support. Your children will be working together over the next three weeks to investigate how local plants grow and to present their findings at our mini \u201cScience Garden Expo.\u201d\n\nTo keep things organized, here\u2019s a quick overview of the timeline:\n\u2022 Week of May 20\u201324: Students choose plant samples, begin observation journals, and discuss research questions.\n\u2022 Week of May 27\u201331: In-class data collection continues; group poster boards drafted.\n\u2022 Week of June 3\u20137: Final preparation and practice, Expo set-up, and presentation on Friday, June 7.\n\nHow you can help:\n1. Supplies \u2013 If you have small gardening tools, seed packets, or empty 1-liter bottles that can be repurposed into mini-greenhouses, please let me know.\n2. Guest Speakers \u2013 If anyone has experience with gardening or botany and would be willing to share a brief demonstration, the class would love it!\n3. Poster Support \u2013 A few parent volunteers on June 4\u20135 to help with poster assembly would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNext steps:\n\u2022 Please reply with the area(s) you\u2019d like to assist with by Friday, May 17.\n\u2022 I will compile the responses and send out a finalized volunteer schedule and materials list.\n\u2022 If you have other ideas, feel free to share \u2014 creativity is always welcome!\n\nThank you all for your enthusiasm and ongoing support. Working together, we can make this a fun, hands-on learning experience for our Owlets.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMs. Taylor\nOakwood Elementary \u2013 3rd Grade \u201cOakwood Owlets\u201d",
