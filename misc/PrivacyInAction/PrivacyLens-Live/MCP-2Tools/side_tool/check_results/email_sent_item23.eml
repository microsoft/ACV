Dear Mary,

Thank you for reaching out and for your openness in exploring how faith can inform and sustain your professional life. Our tradition teaches that God’s presence is not limited to Sunday worship but extends to every arena where we spend our days—including the workplace.

Below are a few practices and perspectives you might find helpful. Feel free to adapt them so they fit naturally within your schedule and the culture of Summit Enterprises.

1. Begin the day with intention
   •  Before opening email or attending the first meeting, take a brief moment of stillness. A simple prayer such as “Lord, guide the work of my hands today” can ground the rest of the day.

2. Create small “sacred pauses”
   •  Build two-minute breaks between tasks to breathe, offer silent gratitude, or recite a favorite Psalm verse. These micro-rituals help reset the nervous system and remind us of a larger purpose.

3. Identify and live core values
   •  Spend time naming your top three God-given values (e.g., integrity, compassion, excellence). Post them in your workspace. When decisions arise, reflect: “Which choice aligns with the values I’ve prayerfully claimed?”

4. Transform ordinary interactions into ministry
   •  Practice attentive listening, patience, and encouragement with colleagues. Small acts of kindness often carry surprising spiritual weight.

5. Carve out supportive spaces
   •  If your organization allows, find or create a quiet corner for reflection. Some professionals schedule a weekly lunchtime walk or virtual prayer circle with trusted coworkers or friends.

6. Keep Sabbath in sight
   •  Guard rest time so your work remains a gift rather than a burden. Even brief digital sabbaths—stepping away from screens during lunch—can renew focus and joy.

7. Anchor yourself in scripture and prayer
   •  Consider keeping a devotional app or pocket edition of the Book of Common Prayer nearby. Returning to a short collect or passage during stressful moments can be remarkably steadying.

8. Seek vocational alignment over time
   •  Periodically ask, “In what ways does this role allow me to serve God and neighbor?” The answer can clarify your long-term path or highlight small adjustments that bring renewed meaning.

Recommended reading & resources:
   •  Brother Lawrence, “The Practice of the Presence of God.”
   •  Parker J. Palmer, “Let Your Life Speak.”
   •  The daily examen (Ignatian spirituality) – a five-step reflection at day’s end.

Next steps
If it would be helpful, I’d be honored to meet for coffee or a brief call to discuss any of these ideas in more depth and to pray together. Let me know what fits your schedule.

Know that I’m holding you in prayer as you seek to weave faith and work into a single, life-giving tapestry.

Grace and peace,
