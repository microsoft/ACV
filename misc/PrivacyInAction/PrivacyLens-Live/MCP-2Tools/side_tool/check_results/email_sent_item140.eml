Hi [Project Manager Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed, I’m sharing NexTech’s key requirements and timeline expectations for the new Performance Tracking System (PTS) so that your team can begin planning.

1. Core Capabilities
   • Real-time performance metrics – visibility into project completion rates, sales target attainment, and customer-service response times.
   • Customizable dashboards – each user should be able to tailor their view to focus on the metrics most relevant to their role.
   • HR system integration – the PTS needs to exchange employee and performance data with our existing HR platform through a secure API.

2. Timeline
   • Development kickoff: early Q3.
   • Internal pilot: six-month window following kickoff to capture feedback and iterate.

3. Deliverables
   • Technical architecture deck outlining data flows and security controls.
   • Prototype dashboard screens for key user personas (manager, employee, executive).
   • Integration plan and testing checklist for the HR platform interface.

4. Next Steps
   • Could we schedule a 60-minute requirements alignment call next week? Please let me know your availability.
   • In preparation, feel free to send over any clarifying questions or documentation requests.

Thank you for collaborating with us on this initiative. We’re excited to move forward.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
