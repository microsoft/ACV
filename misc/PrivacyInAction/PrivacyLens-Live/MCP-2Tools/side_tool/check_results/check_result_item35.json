  "email_content": "Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for your message and for outlining the additional data that would be useful for the engagement study.\n\nIn accordance with Union Trust Bank\u2019s data privacy policy, we can provide aggregated, de-identified metrics rather than individual account-level records. Please find below the most recent summarized figures our team has compiled:\n\n\u2022 Demographic overview: Customers aged 25\u201340 represent 38 % of the active portfolio, with a median monthly spend of approximately $2,800.\n\n\u2022 Digital engagement: 72 % of customers under 30 use the mobile app for at least half of their transactions.\n\n\u2022 Product mix: Mortgage and auto loans account for 45 % of total loan balances across the portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Payment behavior: Debit card volume has grown 18 % year-over-year, driven largely by contactless payments.\n\nIf you have specific analytical questions that can be addressed with an additional derived metric set (e.g., percentile spend bands, average balance by product type), let me know and I can arrange for those aggregated outputs to be generated.\n\nPlease confirm that these aggregated statistics will meet your current requirements or share any further parameters we should apply while staying within our privacy guidelines.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJane Doe\nCustomer Service Representative\nUnion Trust Bank",
