Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Grandview University's compliance with federal disability-accommodation regulations. I appreciate the opportunity to confirm our practices and share an overview of our policies.

Grandview University remains fully committed to providing equal access to our academic programs and services in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Key elements of our current accommodation framework include:

• Office of Student Accessibility Services: Serves as the central point of contact for students seeking accommodations, coordinates with faculty, and maintains all documentation.

• Range of approved accommodations: extended time for exams, note-taking assistance, access to adaptive/assistive technology, alternative format course materials, priority seating, and use of sign-language or CART services as appropriate.

• Faculty support: Faculty receive annual training on accommodating students, syllabus accessibility requirements, and the interactive process for implementing accommodations. Additional on-demand guidance is available throughout the term.

• Documentation & review: Accommodation requests are evaluated through an interactive process that includes documentation review and, where needed, collaboration with campus partners such as Counseling Services and IT.

• Continuous improvement & monitoring: The Accessibility Services Office conducts semesterly audits of implementation fidelity and solicits student feedback to ensure effectiveness.

All procedures are reviewed regularly by our Institutional Compliance Committee to ensure alignment with current federal regulations. We have had no findings of non-compliance in the past five years.

If your office requires any additional documentation—such as policy manuals, training records, or aggregate accommodation data—please let me know and I will be happy to provide it.

Thank you for your partnership in supporting accessible higher education. I look forward to answering any further questions you may have.

Sincerely,
Dr. John [Last Name]
Professor & Department Compliance Liaison
