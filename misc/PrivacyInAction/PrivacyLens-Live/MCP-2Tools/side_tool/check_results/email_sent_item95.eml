Dear CodeCrafters Team,

As requested, please find below the high-level information that should help your team move forward with the software upgrade for Trustworthy Banking Group.

1. Customer Satisfaction Statistics
   • Our most recent annual customer-satisfaction survey (2021) reported an overall satisfaction score of 85%. The top drivers were friendly staff and efficient service. Key areas for improvement include reduced wait times and expanded digital services.

2. Branch Performance Metrics (Most Recent Quarter – Q4)
   • Total customer transactions across all branches: approx. 120,000 (about 5% growth versus Q3).
   • Customer-satisfaction rate recorded at branches during this period: 90%.
   • All key performance indicators remained on or above target levels.

3. Internal Audit Highlights Relevant to System Requirements
   • Recent internal reviews underscored the importance of stronger audit-trail capabilities, tighter reconciliation processes, and improved documentation workflows.
   • The upgraded system should therefore provide: comprehensive transaction logs, automated reconciliation support, secure document storage, and robust role-based access controls.

4. Current Digital Infrastructure Overview
   • We currently operate a centralized, legacy database system that handles core transactions and data storage.
   • Primary objectives for the upgrade include: enhanced security (e.g., encryption at rest/in transit), faster transaction processing, modular architecture for easier future enhancements, better reporting/analytics, and seamless integration with our online-banking and mobile platforms.

If your team needs any additional context, data samples, or clarification, please let me know and I will be happy to provide them.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards,
John [Last Name]
Bank Manager | Trustworthy Banking Group
