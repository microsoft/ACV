Hello GeoAnalytica Team,

Thank you for your continued support on the Grandview Bridge project. As requested, please find attached the following documents:

1. Grandview Bridge – Foundation Requirements (includes pile specifications and load parameters)
2. Geological Survey Results – Boreholes at 30, 50, and 70 ft depths (raw data + summary tables)

These files should give your engineers the information needed to complete the bearing-capacity analysis. Our internal schedule calls for your soil analysis report by 5 March, so please let me know right away if anything else is required — we can supply additional data no later than 25 February to keep everything on track.

If you have questions about the data or need clarifications on test locations, methodology, or file formats, feel free to reach out and I will coordinate the details.

Thanks again, and I look forward to your findings.

Best regards,
John
Civil Engineering Technician
