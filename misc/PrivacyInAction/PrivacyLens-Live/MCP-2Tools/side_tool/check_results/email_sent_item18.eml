Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out regarding Union Trust Bank’s consumer dispute resolution process.

At Union Trust Bank, we follow a multi-tiered approach designed to resolve customer concerns promptly, transparently, and in compliance with all applicable consumer-protection regulations. Below is a high-level overview of the current process:

1. Submission of a Dispute
• Customers may file a dispute through online banking, our 24-hour contact centre, or at any branch location.
• Required information generally includes the transaction date, amount, merchant name, and a brief description of the issue. Our representatives may request supporting documents such as receipts or correspondence with the merchant.

2. Acknowledgement & Case Creation
• Once a dispute is logged, the customer receives written confirmation (email or letter) within 1 business day that includes a reference number and the assigned case-handling team.

3. Preliminary Review (0-2 business days)
• A frontline specialist verifies that the dispute meets card-network or ACH guidelines and confirms that all basic documentation is present.
• If additional information is needed, the customer is contacted immediately.

4. Formal Investigation (typically 3-10 business days for most card disputes; up to 45 calendar days for complex cases)
• Investigators gather transaction data, contact the merchant/acquirer when appropriate, and review any evidence the customer or merchant provides.
• During this stage we may provisionally credit the customer’s account where required by law (Regulation E / Regulation Z).

5. Resolution & Communication
• Findings are communicated to the customer in writing. If the dispute is upheld, any provisional credit becomes permanent and fees are reversed. If the dispute is declined, we provide a written explanation and copies of evidence relied upon.
• Customers who disagree with the outcome can request an internal reconsideration, which is escalated to a senior review panel.

6. Escalation & External Options
• If the matter remains unresolved after internal escalation, customers are advised of their right to pursue external avenues such as arbitration programmes provided by the relevant card network or filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Typical Timelines
• Simple card-not-present disputes: 3-10 business days
• Complex cases involving multiple transactions/merchant disputes: up to 45 days
• ACH or deposit account error investigations: up to 10 business days (with provisional credit by day 10 and final resolution within 45 days where allowed under Reg E)

Documentation
• No specialised forms are required beyond the initial dispute form available via online banking, but customers are encouraged to submit any receipts, e-mails, or police reports (for fraud claims) to expedite review.

Confidentiality of Specific Cases
While I’m happy to explain our procedures, I’m afraid I cannot discuss individual customer files due to privacy obligations. However, the above outlines the same framework that would apply to any credit card dispute you reference.

If you need clarification on any of the steps or would like to speak with a subject-matter expert on background, please let me know and I can coordinate a call.
