Dear Oakwood Alumni Reunion Committee,

I hope you’re all doing well as you continue planning our upcoming reunion celebrations. I wanted to share a few recent highlights from our Alumni Tracker that you might like to weave into your communications and event program:

Class of 2005
• John Smith has been promoted to Director of Marketing at Innotech Solutions.
• Emily Johnson’s second novel has been shortlisted for a national literary award.

Class of 2010
• Mark Lee recently launched a tech start-up that has secured significant venture-capital backing.
• Lisa Ray’s non-profit organization has expanded its educational programs to three additional countries.

Key Dates & Opportunities
• June 15 – Oakwood Charity Gala, where several alumni will be recognized for their philanthropic contributions.
• April 30 – Deadline for applications to the Oakwood Alumni Scholarship fund.

Please feel free to feature these stories or any others you think will resonate with your classmates. If you have updates of your own that you’d like added to the tracker or promoted by the Alumni Office, just let me know.

Thank you all for the energy you’re bringing to the reunion effort. I’m here to support you with publicity, venue coordination, or anything else you need.

Warm regards,

Jane [Last Name]
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Oakwood University
