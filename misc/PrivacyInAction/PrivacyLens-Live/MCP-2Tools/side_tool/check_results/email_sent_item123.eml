Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about emerging trends, especially advancements in AI, the growing potential of quantum computing, and practical blockchain applications.

As promised, I’m sending a few resources and recent articles I found useful:

• AI: Stanford’s 2025 AI Index Report – good overview of current research directions.
• Quantum computing: IBM’s roadmap update and the Qiskit community tutorials.
• Blockchain: Gartner’s latest report on enterprise blockchain adoption.

If you’re interested, I’d love to set up a 30-minute call next week to dive deeper into how these trends might influence our respective projects and explore potential collaboration opportunities.

Let me know what your schedule looks like, and I’ll send a calendar invite.

Looking forward to staying in touch.

Best regards,
Jane
