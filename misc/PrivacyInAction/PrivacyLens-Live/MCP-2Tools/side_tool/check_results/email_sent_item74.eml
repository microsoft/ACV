Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. Here are the main updates since our last check-in:

1. Security System Upgrade
   • The new facial-recognition module has been installed at the designated checkpoints.
   • Initial validation tests show roughly a 15 % increase in identification accuracy compared to the previous baseline.

2. Traffic-Flow Data Analysis
   • The full dataset from last quarter is now cleaned and ready. Your preliminary insights were helpful, and I’ve started running them through our efficiency models.
   • The focus this week is to pinpoint the primary bottlenecks and model potential queue-time reductions.

3. Next Steps and Timeline
   • Complete the first draft of the bottleneck analysis later this week.
   • Integrate the findings into our joint paper outline during the following week.
   • Schedule a call early the week after to review results and assign tasks for the optimisation proposal.

Let me know if these timings work for you or if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Jane
