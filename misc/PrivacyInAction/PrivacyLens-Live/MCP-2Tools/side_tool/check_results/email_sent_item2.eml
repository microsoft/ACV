Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you! Below is a concise toolkit I’ve found helpful when working with clients who present with anxiety disorders. Feel free to adapt anything to your style or client population.

1. Initial Assessment
   • Use a brief standardized measure (GAD-7, Beck Anxiety Inventory) at intake and periodically thereafter to track progress.
   • Clarify the subtype (GAD, panic, social, etc.) and rule out medical contributors.

2. Psycho-education
   • Normalise the anxiety response (fight-or-flight), emphasising that symptoms are uncomfortable but not dangerous.
   • Introduce the CBT model early so clients see the link between thoughts, feelings and behaviours.

3. Cognitive Work
   • Self-monitoring diary: have clients jot down automatic thoughts, triggers, and SUDS ratings between 0-100.
   • Cognitive restructuring: identify common distortions (catastrophising, fortune-telling) and generate balanced alternatives.

4. Exposure & Behavioural Experiments
   • Create a graded hierarchy (10-step is usually workable).
   • Pair in-session imaginal exposure with homework in vivo exposure; emphasise tolerating, not escaping, the anxiety peak.
   • Use behavioural experiments to test feared predictions (e.g., “If I blush in the meeting, everyone will think I’m incompetent”).

5. Skills for Physiological Arousal
   • Diaphragmatic breathing (4-4-6 count) – practise daily when calm; deploy during spikes.
   • Progressive muscle relaxation or paired muscle-tension release.
   • Mindfulness grounding: 5-4-3-2-1 sensory scan.

6. Lifestyle & Relapse Prevention
   • Sleep hygiene, caffeine reduction, and regular aerobic activity all moderate baseline arousal.
   • Develop an early-warning plan: identify triggers + coping menu, schedule booster sessions at 1-, 3- and 6-month marks.

7. Recommended Reading / Handouts (client-friendly)
   • The Anxiety and Worry Workbook – Clark & Beck
   • Mind Over Mood (2nd ed.) – Greenberger & Padesky
   • "How to Worry Less" handout (CBT triangle + worry time technique)

8. Therapist References
   • Barlow, D.H. (Ed.). Clinical Handbook of Psychological Disorders (latest edition)
   • Craske & Barlow. Mastery of Your Anxiety & Panic series.

Let me know if you’d like sample worksheets or to role-play exposure scripting—happy to jump on a quick call.

Hope this helps and good luck with your anxious clients this week!

Best,
John
