  "email_content": "Hi Carlos,\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. As promised, here\u2019s a concise guide you can share with New Horizons members who are looking to establish or strengthen their credit profiles in the United States.\n\n1. Start with a secured credit card\n   \u2022 Many banks and credit unions offer these cards. A refundable cash deposit (often $200\u2013$500) becomes the credit limit. Making small purchases and paying the balance in full each month establishes a positive payment history.\n\n2. Explore credit-builder loans\n   \u2022 Community banks and credit unions frequently provide small installment loans ($300\u2013$1,000) that are held in a locked savings account while you make monthly payments. Each on-time payment is reported to the credit bureaus and builds credit history. At the end of the term, borrowers receive the accumulated savings.\n\n3. Become an authorized user on a trusted person\u2019s card\n   \u2022 If a family member or close friend has a well-managed credit card (low balance, solid payment history), being added as an authorized user can help transmit that positive history to the newcomer\u2019s credit file. Make sure the primary cardholder\u2019s habits are responsible.\n\n4. Report non-traditional payments\n   \u2022 Services such as Experian Boost, LevelCredit, or rent-reporting programs can add on-time rent, utility, and phone payments to a credit file, providing extra data points for thin or new credit reports.\n\n5. Practice healthy utilization and payment habits\n   \u2022 Keep credit card balances below 30% of the limit (below 10% is even better).\n   \u2022 Set up automatic payments or calendar reminders to avoid missed payments \u2013 payment history is the largest factor in credit scores.\n\n6. Monitor credit regularly\n   \u2022 Everyone is entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major bureaus annually at AnnualCreditReport.com. Reviewing reports helps catch errors or fraud early.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\u2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) \u2013 \u201cBuilding or Repairing Your Credit\u201d guide\n\u2022 NerdWallet & Bankrate \u2013 up-to-date lists of secured cards and credit-builder loans\n\u2022 Local credit unions \u2013 often have multilingual staff and newcomer-friendly products\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer questions or set up a brief workshop if that would benefit your members.\n\nBest regards,\nJane\nCredit Analyst, Grandstone Bank\njane.doe@gmail.com | (555) 123-4567",
