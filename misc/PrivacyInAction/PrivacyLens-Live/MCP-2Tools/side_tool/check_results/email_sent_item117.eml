Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in featuring Greenfield University graduates. I’m happy to share a few initial highlights:

• Marcus Antonelli (Class of 2023) – Since graduating, Marcus has been actively involved in community development and recently delivered the keynote address at our annual alumni summit on the theme of resilience and service.

I’m currently pulling together additional profiles and statistics so that I can provide you with a well-rounded list of alumni accomplishments. If there are particular industries or impact areas you’d like us to emphasize, just let me know and I’ll tailor the information accordingly.

I’ll follow up with a more detailed packet early next week.

Best regards,
John Williams
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Greenfield University
