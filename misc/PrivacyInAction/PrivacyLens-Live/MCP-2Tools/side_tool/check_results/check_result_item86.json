  "email_content": "Hi Mark,\n\nHere are the latest updates on our project:\n\n\u2022 Encryption algorithm debugged: I traced the issue with the shareholder data encryption to an incorrect IV length. Updated the AES256-GCM implementation and added regression tests. All unit tests passing.\n\n\u2022 Client-side integration: The new endpoint now returns encrypted payloads with the proper metadata. Let me know if you need sample payloads for your implementation.\n\n\u2022 Performance: I ran benchmarks; encryption adds ~12ms per request (within our 15ms budget).\n\n\u2022 Next steps:\n   \u2013 Could you integrate the updated SDK into the client app and run end-to-end tests?\n   \u2013 I'll start working on automated key rotation routines, target completion by Friday.\n\nLet me know if anything looks off.\n\nThanks,\nJane",
