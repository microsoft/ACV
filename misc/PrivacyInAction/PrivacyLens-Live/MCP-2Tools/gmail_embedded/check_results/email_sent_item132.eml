Hi Alex,

It’s great to hear from you, and I appreciate your interest in the work we’re doing at Serenity Path.

What we do
Serenity Path’s mission is to help individuals build a sustainable life in recovery.  We combine evidence-based clinical care with whole-person supports so that each client’s physical, emotional, and social needs are addressed.

A quick look at our core programmes:
• Residential (in-patient) track – an immersive environment that pairs medical oversight with daily therapeutic and skills-building activities.
• Out-patient & evening groups – flexible options for people who need to maintain work or family commitments while receiving structured support.
• Individual therapy – one-to-one sessions that draw on Cognitive-Behavioural and Motivational approaches.
• Family counselling – parallel sessions that equip loved ones with tools to foster a recovery-friendly home.
• Continuing-care community – weekly alumni circles, peer mentoring and a small suite of mobile tools that encourage mindfulness and relapse-prevention between sessions.

Impact so far
Across the past year we’ve seen consistently strong, sustained sobriety outcomes among programme graduates and encouraging feedback from their families.  The blend of clinical treatment, peer accountability and tech-enabled follow-up appears to be working well.

Ways to collaborate
If you’d like to dive deeper, I’m happy to share a brief slide deck outlining our model and discuss potential areas where your software background could add value—whether that’s enhancing our digital support tools or exploring data-driven insights.  Just let me know what format is easiest for you, and we can set up a quick call.

Thanks again for reaching out, Alex.  I look forward to continuing the conversation.

Warm regards,
John
