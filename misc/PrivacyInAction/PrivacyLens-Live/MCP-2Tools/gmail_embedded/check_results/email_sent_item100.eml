• Purpose: to bring neighbors together for a day of support that includes free meals, basic health screenings, a small job-fair area, and family-friendly activities.

• Volunteer-run health-check area
• Job-fair booths hosted by local businesses
• Games and crafts for children and families

Volunteers

Promotion
Flyers, service announcements, and social-media posts are in the works. Your team’s channels are a great help here.

Next steps
1. Schedule a brief check-in with you to review final logistics.
2. Confirm the parish volunteer roster and any special materials your team might need.
3. Coordinate any additional tables/chairs or other setup items.

Please let me know if these details align with your expectations or if you see anything we should adjust. Thank you again for partnering with us—your support is invaluable to making Community Care Day a success.
