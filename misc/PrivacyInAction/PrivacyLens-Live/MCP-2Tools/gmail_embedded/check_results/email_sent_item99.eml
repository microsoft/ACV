Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to share a quick update on how things are going with the folks we’re both supporting.

• Michael successfully wrapped up the advanced phase of his job-training program and is already interviewing with a few local employers. He’s very motivated and optimistic about landing a position soon. He’s also been putting new budgeting habits into practice and says he feels much more in control of his finances.

• Overall engagement at the center keeps growing, and our partnership with Unity Church continues to play a big part in that success. Volunteer turnout has been steady, and solid funding is allowing us to broaden several key programs this season.

Thank you for everything you do to keep this collaboration running smoothly. Let me know if you’d like more details or want to schedule time to plan next steps.

Warmly,
[Your Name]
