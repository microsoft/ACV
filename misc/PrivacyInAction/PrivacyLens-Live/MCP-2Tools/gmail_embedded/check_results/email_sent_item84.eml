Hi Maria,

Hope you're doing well. Here’s a concise rundown of the next steps for the marketing project:

1. Finalize the ad copy – target completion in the first week of March.
2. Secure media placements – aim for mid-March.
3. Schedule social-media posts – plan for the calendar to begin rolling out in late March.
4. Prepare the marketing team for the product-launch event – have everything ready by early April.
5. Coordinate with the sales team so their outreach aligns with the campaign timeline.

Let me know if any of these need adjusting or if you’d like to discuss further.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
