Hi Sarah,

Here’s a concise snapshot of where our key projects stand:

• Health Empowerment and Awareness Program (HEAP)
  – Educational workshop framework is drafted; we’re confirming facilitator availability and will circulate a schedule shortly.
  – Pamphlet content has been outlined and is with the design team for layout.
  – Web-based resources are moving into the testing phase; feedback from a small user group will be gathered soon.

• Vax4All Initiative
  – Temporary vaccination site logistics have been mapped out and we’re finalizing agreements with community partners.
  – Outreach materials are in development to support the awareness push; once approved, we’ll coordinate distribution.
  – Volunteer training modules are nearly complete. A brief run-through is planned before rollout.

Let me know if you need any extra details or if there’s anything you’d like me to prioritize.

Thanks!
