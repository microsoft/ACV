Hi Alex,

Thanks for reaching out. To help you focus your study time, the upcoming exam will concentrate on three main areas:

• Cryptography fundamentals – be comfortable explaining the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, including typical use-cases, strengths/limitations, and common algorithm examples.

• Ethical considerations around data breaches – think about how breaches affect various stakeholders, responsibilities for disclosure, and the broader societal impact.

• Evaluating cybersecurity measures – practice assessing the effectiveness of different technical and organizational controls when presented with a scenario (for instance, comparing the value of firewalls, intrusion detection, access controls, and incident-response planning).

The questions will emphasize clear explanation of concepts and the ability to apply them to practical cases. Reviewing the relevant lecture notes, assigned readings, and lab exercises should give you a solid foundation.

Let me know if anything needs further clarification.

Best regards,
Professor Doe
