Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m excited about our upcoming collaboration between Helping Hands Alliance and our team. To keep things moving, I’d like to:

• Share a preliminary list of volunteers who’ve expressed interest
• Finalize the training outline for the counseling sessions
• Agree on a general schedule for the volunteer training workshops (I’m aiming for early next month, but I’m flexible)

Would you be available for a brief call late this week or early next to walk through these details? If you have any preferences or additional considerations, just let me know.

Thanks again for partnering with us—looking forward to making a positive impact together.

Best regards,
Jane
