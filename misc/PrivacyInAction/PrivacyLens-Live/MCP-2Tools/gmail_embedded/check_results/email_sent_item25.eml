Hello Team,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick overview of the latest changes to our physical workspace and our project workflow.

1. Office Renovations
• Renovations begin next week and will run for approximately four weeks.
• Certain areas will be temporarily closed; look for signage each morning.
• We'll aim to keep noise and disruptions to a minimum and will provide weekly progress notes.

2. AgileBoost Workflow Adoption
• We’re rolling out the AgileBoost project-management system to streamline collaboration.
• Initial setup starts next week; a small pilot project will help us fine-tune settings.
• Training workshops will be scheduled over the coming weeks—calendar invitations will follow shortly.
• Full rollout is expected over a six-week transition period.

Next Steps
• Please attend one of the training sessions.
• If you have concerns about workspace access during renovation, contact the Facilities team.
• Managers will circulate more specifics relevant to their teams.

Thank you for your flexibility and support as we continue to improve our environment and processes.

Best regards,
John
