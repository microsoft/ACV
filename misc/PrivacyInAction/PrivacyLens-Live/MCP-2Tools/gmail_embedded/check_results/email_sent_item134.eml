Dear GeoAnalytica Team,

Thank you for your continued support on the Grandview Bridge project. I’m writing to outline our next steps and ensure we remain aligned.

• Data package: We are compiling the latest geological survey results, including bearing-capacity readings taken at approximately 30, 50, and 70 ft. You will receive the full data set and drawings within the next few business days via our secure file-transfer link.

• Deliverables timeline: In line with the current schedule, we would appreciate receiving your comprehensive soil analysis report by early next month. Please confirm that this timeframe still works for your team, or let us know if you foresee any constraints.

• Additional support: If you need further information or clarification on any aspect of the data, just let me know and we will arrange it promptly.

We value our partnership and look forward to your insights to keep the project moving forward.

Best regards,
John Doe
