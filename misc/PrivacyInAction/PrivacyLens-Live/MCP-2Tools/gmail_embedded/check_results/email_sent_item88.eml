Hi Emily,

I hope you’re doing well! Building on our recent conversations and some of the ideas we’ve both been gathering, I wanted to share a few approaches that could help us expand Community United’s donation reach this year:

1. Strengthen recurring giving: Encourage supporters to set up monthly gifts through simple, mobile-friendly signup flows and clear impact messaging.
2. Launch a social crowdfunding campaign: Pair a time-bound online drive with engaging stories, short videos, and peer-to-peer sharing incentives.
3. Offer new giving channels: Add options such as contact-less mobile payments and, for tech-savvy donors, cryptocurrency contributions.
4. Enhance donor recognition: Create a tiered recognition program (thank-you spotlights, impact updates, virtual meet-and-greets) to nurture long-term relationships.
5. Partner with local businesses: Explore matching-gift days or in-kind sponsorships that both raise funds and broaden our reach.
6. Joint community fundraiser: Revive the idea of a co-hosted event so we can pool resources, share networks, and maximize visibility.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and prioritize the strategies that resonate most with Community United’s goals. If you’re available, could we schedule a brief call next week to map out next steps?

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
John
