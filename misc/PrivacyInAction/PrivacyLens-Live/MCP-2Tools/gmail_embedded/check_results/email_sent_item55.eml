Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out about the SkyHigh Tower foundation design. I’ve worked on similar high-rise projects and am happy to share some approaches that have proven helpful:

• Establish an iterative soil–structure interaction model early on so that axial, lateral and overturning demands are captured concurrently. A simple Winkler spring model is a good starting point, but you’ll want to refine it with site-specific stiffness once geotech updates come in.

• Map the full gravity and lateral load path from superstructure down to the mat/pile system. That helps spot any hidden discontinuities before you lock in member sizes.

• Check service-level settlements first, then move to strength-level combinations. In previous towers we found that keeping total settlement under roughly 1/500 of the building height provided comfortable drift margins.

• For load-bearing capacity, target a base safety factor of 3.0 for ultimate combinations and 2.0 for seismic. Adjust if local code allows but it’s a solid baseline during concept design.

• Don’t forget the raft-edge shear punch checks around elevator and stair cores—those critical zones often govern thickness.

I’ve pulled together a concise guideline that summarises the above points along with wind-induced overturning checks and load-distribution charts. Let me know if you’d like me to share it or walk through any of the steps in more detail.

Happy to jump on a quick call later this week if that would help.

Best regards,
Jane
