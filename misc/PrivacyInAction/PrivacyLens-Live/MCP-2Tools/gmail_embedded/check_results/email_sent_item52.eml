Dear Professor Smith,

I hope you are well. I am writing regarding Emily Carter, a student in your class. Emily recently experienced a serious personal incident beyond her control, which has temporarily affected her well-being and her ability to focus on coursework and assessments.

She is actively addressing the situation and receiving appropriate support, but she anticipates that she may need some flexibility over the coming days as she works to regain her academic footing. Emily values your course and intends to complete all required work; however, an extension on the most recent assessment and general understanding with participation expectations would be greatly appreciated.

Please let me know if additional documentation is required, or if we can arrange a brief conversation to discuss how best to support her during this time.

Thank you very much for your understanding and compassion.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Student Support Services
