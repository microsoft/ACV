Hello Alex and the InnovateX Hiring Team,

Thank you for your continued interest in my candidacy for the Lead Developer position. After researching current market benchmarks for comparable roles and reflecting on my years of experience leading engineering teams and delivering high-impact projects, I believe a competitive total cash compensation would fall in the range of $135,000–$145,000 per year (exclusive of standard benefits, bonuses, and any equity incentives).

I am, of course, open to discussing the full compensation package holistically, including performance-based incentives and long-term growth opportunities, to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement.

Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide. I look forward to the next steps in the hiring process and the possibility of contributing to InnovateX’s continued success.

Best regards,
John
