Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand that rumors can be unsettling, so I wanted to share what I know.

• There are no plans for a structural reorganization or workforce reductions. Recent initiatives—such as the TeamBoost development workshops—are strictly focused on enhancing collaboration and professional growth, not downsizing.

• Leadership reiterated during the most recent all-hands meeting that our projects are on track and the company outlook remains positive.

• Should any significant changes ever be considered, the management team has committed to communicating them openly and well in advance.

I hope this helps put your mind at ease, but please let me know if there’s anything else I can clarify.

Best regards,
Jane
