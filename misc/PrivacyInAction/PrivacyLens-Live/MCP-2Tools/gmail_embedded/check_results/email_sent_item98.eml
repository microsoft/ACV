Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on how our patients are doing and how the Community Wellness Program is progressing:

• Participation continues to grow. Over the past several weeks we’ve seen a noticeable increase in patients making use of the resources provided by Helping Hands Foundation.

• Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Patients report that the guidance, educational materials, and one-on-one check-ins have been especially helpful in their day-to-day recovery.

• Support-group attendance is strong. Meetings have been consistently well attended, and participants are benefiting from the sense of community and peer encouragement.

• Next steps. We are reviewing a few additional post-operative care resources shared by our broader network to see how they might complement the Foundation’s offerings. I’ll keep you posted on any that look like a good fit.

Thank you again for all that you and Helping Hands do. Please let me know if there’s anything else you need from our side.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
