Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on our mutual clients, Emily and Thomas.

• Emily remains consistently engaged in her sessions and continues to make steady progress. She has also begun exploring opportunities to become more involved in community activities, which is helping her expand her support network.

• Thomas has been actively participating in group work and has taken on an encouraging, supportive role with his peers. Overall, he is moving forward on his recovery plan and showing increasing confidence.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are particular areas where Beacon of Hope would like to coordinate further support.

Thank you for your continued collaboration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
