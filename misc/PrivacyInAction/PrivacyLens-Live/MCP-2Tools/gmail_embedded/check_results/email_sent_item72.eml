Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to consolidate the key points we have for the upcoming Helping Hands Foundation charity gala and outline the items still needing your input.

Event Overview
• Date: early March
• Venue: the main ballroom at the Metropolitan Hotel downtown
• Schedule: festivities will run from early evening through late evening, featuring dinner service, a silent auction, live music, and an awards segment.
• Guest speaker: a renowned philanthropist has confirmed and will deliver brief remarks.

Action Items
1. Volunteer assignments – please let me know how many additional volunteers we still need and whether you’d like me to circulate the sign-up link again.
2. Final guest list – I’ll put together the latest RSVP spreadsheet; could you review and highlight any outstanding invitations that need follow-up?
3. Vendor confirmations – I will contact catering and AV teams this week; if you have any updated requirements, let me know.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you’d prefer to meet for a quick check-in.

Thanks for your help, Mark!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
