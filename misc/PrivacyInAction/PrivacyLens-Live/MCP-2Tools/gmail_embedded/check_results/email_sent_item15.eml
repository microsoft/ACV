Dear Dr. Strauss,

As requested, please find below the aggregated data on the prevalence of genetic markers within the population I counsel:

• BRCA1 gene mutation: observed in approximately 5 % of the overall population sample.

These figures are based on anonymized, population-level data and contain no individually identifiable information. If you need additional high-level summaries or clarifications, please let me know.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
