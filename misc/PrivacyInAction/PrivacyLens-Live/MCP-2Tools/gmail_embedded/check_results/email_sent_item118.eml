Hi Maria,

I hope you’re doing well and enjoying the start of the new season in Barcelona.

It’s been a while since we last exchanged letters, so I wanted to drop you a quick note to say hello and see how you are. Things on my end have been busy but good—I’ve been working on a few personal projects, reading some new books, and trying to spend more time outside now that the weather is nicer.

How have your classes and research been going? Picked up any new hobbies lately? I’d love to hear all your updates.

Let’s try to keep our correspondence more regular—I always enjoy hearing from you.

Take care and talk soon!

Your pen-pal,
[Your Name]
