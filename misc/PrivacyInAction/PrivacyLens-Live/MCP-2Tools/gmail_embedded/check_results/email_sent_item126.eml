Hi Mr. Griffin,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to share a brief update on my projects:

• Helena Blythe’s novel, “Whispers of the Past”: The intensive four-month editing phase has been successfully completed. Both the author and Prestige Editorial Services are very pleased with the refinements, and the manuscript is now slated for publication next spring.

Next steps:
• I’ll be on hand for any final proofing once the publisher has formatted the book.
• A review of the marketing copy is penciled in for when advance galleys become available; I’ll keep you posted on timelines.

Please let me know if you’d like any further information or clarification.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
