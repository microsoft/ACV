Hi Sarah,

Welcome aboard! I wanted to give you a concise status snapshot of our active matters so you can hit the ground running.

• Case #7643 – Commercial Litigation
  – We obtained new evidence last week that significantly strengthens our position. It is now being reviewed for integration into our next round of filings.
  – A confidential witness roster has been compiled and secured in the document management system. We’ll walk through it together during the upcoming strategy meeting.

• Upcoming Milestones
  – Internal strategy review: later this week (invite in your calendar).
  – Filing deadlines and deposition dates: outlined in the shared timeline you’ll find in the case workspace.

Please let me know if you need workspace access, historic pleadings, or anything else before our meeting.

Looking forward to working with you.

Best,
[Your Name]
