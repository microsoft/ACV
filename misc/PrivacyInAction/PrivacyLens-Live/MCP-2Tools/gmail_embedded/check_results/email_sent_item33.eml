Hi Mark,

Here’s the latest snapshot of our leading candidates for the open engineering role:

• Susan Lee – M.S. in Computer Science (MIT) and 5 years at FastTech specializing in AI/ML. Demonstrates strong technical depth and team leadership potential.

• Raj Patel – About 10 years’ experience in cybersecurity at CyberNet and SecureTech. Brings deep expertise in secure systems design and incident response.

Let me know if you’d like to move any of them to the next stage or need additional information.
