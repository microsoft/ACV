Hi Ethan,

I hope you’re well! Here are the key details for the cover design of my upcoming novel, “Whispers of the Past”:

• Overall mood: A blend of mystery and nostalgia.
• Central imagery: An old, ornate key paired with a faded letter.
• Colour palette: Muted earth tones.
• Themes to capture: Hidden secrets, memories resurfacing.

I have a short synopsis and author bio that provide more context—just let me know if you’d like me to send those along.

Thanks so much, and I’m looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
