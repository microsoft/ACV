Hi Ms. Richardson,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick status report on the Zenith Wellness Initiative.

• Participation continues to climb, and we now have engagement from roughly three-quarters of our employees.
• Feedback has been encouraging—colleagues especially appreciate the subsidized gym memberships, personalized nutrition planning, and the stress-management workshops.
• Looking ahead, we plan to broaden our workshop offerings and add short on-site activity breaks to keep momentum strong.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the next steps in more detail.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
