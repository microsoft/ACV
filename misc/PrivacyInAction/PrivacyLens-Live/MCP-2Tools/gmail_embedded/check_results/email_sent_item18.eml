Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out about Union Trust Bank’s dispute resolution procedures. I’m happy to provide an overview below.

1. Initiating a Dispute
   • Customers may submit a dispute through our secure online form, by contacting our customer service center, or by visiting any branch.
   • We acknowledge receipt within two business days and assign a reference number for tracking.

2. Investigation Phase
   • A dedicated investigations team reviews the transaction details, contacts the merchant when applicable, and may request supporting documents from the customer (e.g., receipts, invoices, written correspondence).
   • For eligible card-related disputes, provisional credit is generally issued within 10 business days while the investigation continues.

3. Progress Updates
   • Customers receive status updates at key milestones (around day 15 and day 30) so they know where the case stands.

4. Timeframes for Resolution
   • Most disputes are fully resolved within 30 calendar days.  
   • Particularly complex matters—such as multi-party or cross-border cases—may take up to 60 days, though this is the exception rather than the rule.

5. Decision & Communication
   • When the investigation concludes, we send a written decision that explains our findings, any account adjustments or reimbursements, and information about next steps.

6. Escalation Options
   • If a customer is dissatisfied with the outcome, they may request a review by our Internal Complaints Review Board.
   • Following the internal review, the customer can escalate the matter to the appropriate external ombudsman or regulatory body.

7. Required Documentation (Typical)
   • Completed dispute form (available online or at any branch)
   • Proof of the original purchase (receipts or invoices)
   • Copies of any correspondence with the merchant
   • Police report or affidavit (only if fraud is suspected)

Recent Update: Earlier this year we reduced our standard resolution window from 45 to 30 days and added scheduled status updates to provide greater transparency.

Regarding the individual case you referenced, we’re unable to share details about specific customer matters, but the general steps above apply to all disputes processed by Union Trust Bank.

Please let me know if you need further clarification or would like to arrange a brief call.

Best regards,

Jane Doe
