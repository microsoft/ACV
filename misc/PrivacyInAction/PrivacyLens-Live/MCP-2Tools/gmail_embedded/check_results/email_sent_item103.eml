Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on what we’ve been working on lately and let you know about an upcoming community charity event where your insights and collaboration would be extremely valuable.

Recent activities
• We’ve been meeting with parish volunteers and local partners to map out community-service projects for the months ahead.
• A small logistics team has drafted the event layout, activity schedule, and volunteer roles, prioritising accessibility and family-friendly programming.
• We’re tightening our financial-tracking processes to ensure full transparency for all event-related donations and expenditures.

Upcoming charity event
• Target date: mid-March (tentatively the weekend of the 15th).
• Focus: A day-long series of service projects and engagement activities aimed at supporting vulnerable families in our neighbourhood.
• Volunteer needs: on-site registration, activity station leads, and clean-up crews.
• Partnership opportunities: We’d love Helping Hands’ input on best-practice volunteer coordination and any resources you may be able to share (e.g., first-aid station support, outreach materials).

Next steps
If Helping Hands is interested, perhaps we could schedule a short call next week to discuss collaborative possibilities, confirm the date, and run through any compliance requirements on your end.

Thank you for considering this partnership, Sarah. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Warm regards,
