Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I coordinate community literacy projects at [Your Organization]. I’m reaching out to introduce our new initiative, “Read to Succeed,” which is designed to improve the reading skills of children aged 6–10 in our community.

A quick snapshot of the program:
• Weekly interactive reading sessions led by trained volunteers.
• A carefully curated library of age-appropriate, culturally diverse books that children can borrow and take home.
• Family-engagement activities that encourage parents and caregivers to read with their children.

Our goal is simple: to nurture a lifelong love of reading while helping young students build the literacy foundation they need for future academic success.

To bring this vision to life, we are seeking partners who share our commitment to educational empowerment. Support from Helping Hands could help us provide reading materials, train volunteers, and expand our outreach so more families can benefit from the program.

I would welcome the chance to discuss the initiative in more detail and explore ways we might collaborate. Please let me know a convenient time for a brief call or meeting.

Thank you for your dedication to community development, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,
