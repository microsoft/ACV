Hi Maria,

Thank you for reaching out about credit-building. Getting started can feel daunting, but there are several proven steps that work well for newcomers:

1. Start with a secured credit card
   • Choose a bank or credit union that reports to all three credit bureaus.
   • Put down a small refundable deposit, use the card for modest monthly purchases, and pay the balance in full and on time.

2. Consider a credit-builder loan
   • Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and some credit unions offer small installment loans designed specifically to help establish credit history.
   • The loan amount is held in a locked savings account while you make monthly payments; once it’s repaid you receive the funds and a positive payment record.

3. Report alternative data
   • Use rent- and utility-reporting services so your on-time housing and phone/electric bills count toward your score.

4. Become an authorized user
   • If a trusted family member or friend has a well-managed credit card account, being added as an authorized user can quickly add positive history to your file.

5. Keep balances low & pay on time
   • Aim to use no more than 30 % of your available credit and always pay before the due date. Setting up automatic payments can help.

6. Monitor your credit
   • You can obtain free reports annually from annualcreditreport.com and many banks now provide free score monitoring. Reviewing your reports will help you catch any errors early.

7. Avoid unnecessary hard inquiries
   • Only apply for new credit when you truly need it, as multiple applications in a short period can temporarily lower your score.

Local & online resources
• New Horizons’ monthly Financial Literacy Workshop (next session covers credit basics)
• Your neighborhood credit union (often more flexible with newcomers)
• Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s “Building Your Credit” guide (multilingual)
• Immigrant-focused nonprofit Mission Asset Fund – offers low-fee lending circles that help build credit history

If you have specific questions or would like help comparing secured cards or finding a nearby credit-builder loan program, let me know and we can set up a quick call.

You’re already taking the most important step by seeking information early, and I’m happy to support you however I can.

Warm regards,
