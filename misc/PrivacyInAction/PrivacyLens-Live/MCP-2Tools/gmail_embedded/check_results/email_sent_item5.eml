Hi Sarah,

As promised, here’s a concise recap of our discussion at the Global Business Hub:

• Financial overview: We confirmed the company’s solid position following the recent funding round and reviewed last quarter’s expenditures.

• Strategic partnerships & expansion: The team agreed to pursue collaborations with key tech firms and to prepare for market entry in South America and Asia, aiming for implementation in the next few quarters.

• Q2 product launch: We aligned on moving forward with the launch plan, placing strong emphasis on digital marketing channels and targeting tech-savvy millennial users and SMEs.

• External factors: We noted potential impacts from emerging trade policies and underlined the importance of net neutrality; the group will keep monitoring developments and evaluate advocacy options.

Next steps:
– Sarah to circulate a timeline checklist for the expansion plan.
– Marketing to draft the detailed digital campaign proposal.
– Finance to provide an updated budget projection.

Let me know if anything needs adjusting.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
