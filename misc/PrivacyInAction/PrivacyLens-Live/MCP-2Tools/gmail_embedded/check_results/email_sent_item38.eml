Dear Mr. Green,

Thank you for getting in touch and for outlining how the data will help refine the new learning modules.

I can provide EdTech Innovations with an anonymized, aggregated summary of recent student performance at Lincoln High School, including overall averages on the most recent tests and general participation rates in extracurricular activities. The report contains no personally-identifiable information and complies with our internal privacy guidelines.

Please let me know your preferred format (spreadsheet, PDF, or secure shared folder) and I will forward the file right away. If you have any additional requirements or questions, just let me know.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
