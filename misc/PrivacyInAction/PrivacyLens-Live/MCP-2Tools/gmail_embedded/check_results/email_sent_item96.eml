Hello SecureTech Solutions Team,

I hope you're well. We’re moving forward with the biometric scanner installation project for the international terminal and would like to confirm the key details and next steps with you.

Scope of Work
• Install the new biometric fingerprint/face scanners at the designated access points within the terminal.
• Connect the units to power, data, and the AeroSecure Access control network.
• Update the AeroSecure system with the unique scanner IDs once each device is online.
• Run initial hardware diagnostics and perform calibration tests.
• Provide a brief training hand-off to our onsite security staff.

Site Access & Scheduling
• Work is expected to begin early next month. Please provide your team’s availability so we can finalize a detailed schedule that minimizes disruption to daily operations.
• All personnel must present valid security passes (arranged in advance) and comply with airport safety guidelines.

System Credentials
The initial login credentials required to complete the software configuration will be supplied through a secure channel just before the installation window.

Deliverables & Sign-Off
• Completed installation checklist for each scanner.
• Confirmation that the AeroSecure system recognizes and logs each device.
• A short report summarizing any issues encountered and resolutions applied.

Please confirm receipt of this email and let us know if you need any additional information to proceed. We appreciate your partnership and look forward to working with your team on a smooth rollout.
