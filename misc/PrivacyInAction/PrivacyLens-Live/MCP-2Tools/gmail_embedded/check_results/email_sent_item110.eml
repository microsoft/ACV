Hi Alex,

As promised, here are the key technical details from IT so we can keep the cross-departmental project moving:

• Platform & Integration
  – Analytics engine: Advanced Analytics Tool (AAT) v3, exposed via REST-based micro-service.
  – Deployment target: containerized service on the company’s Kubernetes cluster (namespace: marketing-shared).

• Data Ingestion
  – Primary sources: CRM data warehouse + real-time web-analytics stream.
  – Expected volume: ≈100 k records/hr after initial backfill.
  – Refresh cadence: hourly incremental loads; nightly full reconciliation.

• Endpoints & Formats
  – /customerData  – POST & GET (JSON, UTF-8)
  – /campaignPerformance  – GET (JSON, UTF-8)
  – Bulk uploads accepted as gzipped ND-JSON (≤250 MB per file).

• Auth & Security
  – OAuth 2.0 service-account flow (credentials issued by IT).
  – TLS 1.2 enforced on all endpoints; certs auto-renew every 60 days.
  – At-rest encryption: AES-256 (managed keys).

• Logging & Monitoring
  – Centralized logs shipped to Splunk index “mkt-shared”.
  – Metrics exposed via Prometheus at /metrics.

• Next Steps
  1. Let me know if Marketing needs additional fields or alternate formats.
  2. Once you confirm, IT will provision the service account and whitelist your IP range.
  3. We’ll schedule a brief hand-off call to walk through the sample payloads.

Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Best,
Jane
