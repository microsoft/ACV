Dear Mrs. Thompson,

I wanted to provide the requested update on Timmy’s overall health.

• Timmy is currently stable and doing well. 
• His healthcare team has recently fine-tuned his medication, and he is responding positively. 
• He has fully recovered from his recent illness. 
• Please continue to help him follow the action plan we discussed and limit exposure to known triggers.

Let me know if you need any additional information or documentation.

Thank you for keeping an eye on Timmy at school.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
