Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out – we’re excited to partner with AdVantage Media on the upcoming campaign. Below is a concise snapshot of customer insights that should help us refine the messaging and channel mix.

1. Segment highlights
• 18–34 (Millennial/Gen-Z): Roughly four out of five are active in our mobile app each week; top drivers are convenience and no-fee products. They respond well to short-form video and influencer content that showcases real-life money hacks.
• 35–54 (Gen-X/Early Millennials): This group is juggling mortgages, college savings, and everyday banking. Educational tools (rate calculators, refinancing guides) and transparent rate messaging lift engagement noticeably in our recent tests.
• 55 +: Security and personal service matter most. Retirement-focused content combined with simple, reassuring language generates the highest click-throughs. Direct-mail supported by follow-up email still outperforms pure digital for this cohort.

2. Digital behavior trends
• Mobile deposit usage is up significantly year over year; nearly seven in ten check deposits now occur in-app.
• Digital wallet adoption has doubled over the past 12 months (now used by close to half of debit-card holders), driven mainly by the 18–34 segment.
• About three-quarters of customers who have tried our budgeting tool log in at least weekly, suggesting strong appetite for financial-wellness messaging.

3. Pain points & opportunities
• Overdraft-fee anxiety: plain-language alerts and a short “grace period” message strategy have cut negative sentiment in customer feedback.
• Complex fee structures: customers favor bundles that combine checking and savings with a single flat monthly fee.
• Support wait times: proactive in-app chat lowers escalation rates substantially.

4. Recommended creative angles
• “Zero-surprise banking” theme for younger audiences – no hidden fees, instant alerts.
• “Smart home-ownership hub” for 35-54 – calculators, webinars, checklists.
• “Secure tomorrow” series for 55 + – retirement income planners, fraud-protection tips.
• Use sequential storytelling: short explainer video → interactive tool → personalized offer.

Let me know if you’d like deeper dives or additional data points. I’m happy to jump on a quick call to workshop concepts.

Best,
John
