Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for contacting us regarding the disability accommodations available at Grandview University. We are committed to ensuring that every student can access their coursework and campus resources.

Key accommodations we routinely provide include:
• Additional time or a reduced-distraction setting for exams
• Note-taking assistance and course materials in alternative formats
• Access to adaptive and assistive technology

Students interested in receiving support work directly with our Office of Student Accessibility Services. The office reviews documentation, determines appropriate accommodations, and coordinates with instructors to implement them.

Please let me know if you would like more detailed information or if I can connect you with our accessibility team.

Best regards,
Office of Student Accessibility Services
Grandview University
