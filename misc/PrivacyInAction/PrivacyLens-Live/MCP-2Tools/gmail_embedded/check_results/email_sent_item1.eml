Hi Sarah,

Great speaking with you recently about the latest therapy techniques. Here’s a brief recap of what we covered:

• We looked at ways to integrate the Mindful Acceptance Approach with the Integrated Behavioral Framework, noting that the combination offers a balanced blend of present-moment awareness and structured behavior change.

• Key strengths we identified:
  – Mindful Acceptance helps clients observe thoughts and emotions without judgment, reducing avoidance patterns.
  – The Integrated Behavioral Framework provides a clear roadmap for goal setting, skills rehearsal, and measurable progress.
  – Together, the approaches could enhance engagement and long-term adherence.

• Potential next steps:
  1. Draft a pilot protocol outlining session structure, assessment measures, and homework assignments.
  2. Identify training resources for the team to ensure consistent delivery.
  3. Schedule a brief check-in to refine the protocol and discuss implementation timelines.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you’d like to add further points. I’m happy to start a shared document so we can flesh out the pilot.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
