Dear Deputy Secretary Caldwell,

I appreciate the opportunity to share a brief set of observations on several pressing challenges that law-enforcement agencies are navigating and some ideas for collaboration with your office.

1. Strengthening Community Trust
Community-oriented policing initiatives have produced measurable reductions in vandalism and petty theft in certain districts. Regular, informal dialogues between officers and residents—such as neighborhood-watch briefings and “Coffee with a Cop” gatherings—have proven effective in building trust and improving information flow. Expanding similar low-cost, high-trust programs across jurisdictions could enhance public safety while reinforcing legitimacy.

2. Escalation of Cyber-Enabled Crime
While overall crime continues a gradual decline, cyber-related incidents are rising sharply. Local departments report that traditional investigative skill sets are being outpaced by the technical sophistication of offenders. Targeted investment in digital-forensics training, cross-agency information sharing, and public-private partnerships with technology providers would fill critical capability gaps and shorten response times.

3. Resource-Intensive Major Investigations
Recent high-profile cases illustrate how complex investigations can quickly strain resources when offenders exploit surveillance blind spots and operate across multiple precincts. Advanced analytics, data-driven deployment models, and expanded joint-task-force arrangements can help departments maintain momentum without overextending personnel.

4. Opportunities for Collaboration
• Training exchanges focused on cybersecurity and open-source intelligence.
• Grants or pilot programs to modernize evidence-analysis labs.
• Community-engagement toolkits that can be adapted by smaller departments.

I would welcome a brief conversation to discuss how my team’s ongoing work might align with the Department of Public Safety’s priorities.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
