Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out from SecureNow Insurance to follow up on our interest in partnering with Helping Hands Charity.

Our team has been developing a high-level framework that would allow us to combine SecureNow’s resources with Helping Hands’ on-the-ground expertise to better support families recovering from natural disasters. We believe there’s a strong alignment between our missions and real potential to amplify each organization’s impact through collaboration.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to exchange ideas and discuss how we might move forward? I can walk you through our proposed approach and would value your insights on priorities, timelines, and any other considerations from your side.

Please let me know a time that works for you, and I’ll be happy to coordinate.

Looking forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,
