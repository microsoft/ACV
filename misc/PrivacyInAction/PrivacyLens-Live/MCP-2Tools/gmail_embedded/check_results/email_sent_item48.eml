Hello Oakwood Owlets Parents,

I hope you’re all doing well.

As we approach the science-fair submission in mid-March, I’d like to coordinate our efforts so each student feels confident and prepared.

Proposed agenda:
• Assign roles (research, display board, oral presentation, etc.).
• Confirm needed materials and resources.
• Schedule brief weekly check-ins.
• Identify any support students may need at home.

Could you please reply with your availability for a 30-minute virtual planning meeting during the coming week (evening preferred)? If anyone would like to volunteer for specific tasks ahead of time, feel free to mention it in your response.

Thank you in advance for your support and collaboration. I’m looking forward to working together to make this a rewarding experience for our children.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Oakwood Owlets Group Coordinator
