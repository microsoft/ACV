Hi Lisa,

Welcome aboard! Below is a compact snapshot of what tends to help Ethan feel comfortable and engaged. Feel free to keep this handy as you get to know him.

1. Rhythm & Routine
• Ethan thrives on clear, predictable sequences (wake-up, meals, activity blocks, wind-down). Giving him a heads-up before transitions – for example, “In a few minutes we’ll switch to reading time” – helps everything run smoothly.

2. Food & Mealtimes
• Prefers warm, familiar foods and crunchy fruit snacks.
• Calm, low-noise settings let him focus on eating.
• Having a small selection of preferred snacks nearby can turn a rough moment around quickly.

3. Favorite Ways to Play & Learn
• Animals, nature shows, and any chance to visit a petting area or zoo.
• Water play (e.g., simple splash activities); he’s enthusiastic about learning to swim.
• Drawing, colouring, and other open-ended art projects – keeping art supplies in reach is a great ice-breaker.
• Puzzle or problem-solving games offer a nice “quiet focus” option when he needs down-time.

4. Communication & Support
• He’s practising asking for a break when things feel too busy or loud. A gentle prompt like “Would you like a quiet moment?” can make it easier for him to self-advocate.
• Visual or verbal choices ("Do you want music or puzzles next?") help him feel in control and reduce anxiety.

5. First-Day Tip
Opening with an activity that features animals or art, followed by a familiar snack, usually sets a positive tone and builds quick rapport.

Thank you for being part of Ethan’s support team. Let me know if any questions come up – I’m happy to help.

Best,
[Your Name]
