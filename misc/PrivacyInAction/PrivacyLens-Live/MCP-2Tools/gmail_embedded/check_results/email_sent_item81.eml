Hi Sarah,

As promised, here’s a concise update on the current marketing campaign together with an outline of the Q1 strategy.

Performance snapshot (first four weeks):
• Total impressions: ~1.25 M
• Click-through rate: 3.45 %
• Conversion rate: 2.15 %
• Revenue attributed to the campaign: ≈ $78.4 K

Observations & next steps:
• Strongest engagement is in the 25-34 and 35-44 age brackets; we can further tailor creative to these segments.
• A few channels are under-performing relative to forecast – reallocating budget and creative refresh should help lift overall CTR.
• Let’s incorporate retention indicators (repeat-purchase, upsell conversions) in the next reporting cycle so we can track lifetime value more closely.

Q1 Campaign Strategy (high-level):
• Primary goal: deepen engagement with our existing customer base through segmented email sends and targeted social ads.
• Segmentation: audience split by key demographics, with messaging and offers customized per group.
• Creative focus: personalised copy, refreshed visuals once mid-campaign optimisation is complete.
• Measurement: we’ll continue weekly monitoring, with a full optimisation review next month.

If you’d like the detailed spreadsheet or a quick call to go through the data, just let me know.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
