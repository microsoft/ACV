Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. After reviewing recent student work connected to the Read to Succeed initiative, I wanted to share a few observations and ideas that may help us strengthen the program:

1. Skill Growth
• Many students are demonstrating deeper comprehension and stronger critical-thinking when responding to texts. Their essays show better argument structure and use of evidence compared with the start of the term.

2. Current Challenges
• Some learners still have limited access to diverse, high-interest reading materials (both print and digital).
• A handful of students would benefit from more individualized reading pathways that match their pace and interests.

3. Suggestions
• Classroom & Community Library Boost – Partner with local libraries or publishers for rotating book kits that feature a wide range of genres and culturally responsive titles.
• Digital Access – Provide log-ins to reputable e-book platforms so students can read on any device.
• Personalized Reading Plans – Create short “choice lists” aligned to each student’s reading level and interests; track progress with quick weekly check-ins.
• Peer Mentors – Pair older students who enjoy reading with younger participants for brief, weekly reading circles.
• Family Engagement – Share simple guides that help caregivers discuss books at home, even if they have limited time.

Let me know if any of these ideas align with your next steps. I’m happy to flesh out details or help coordinate resources.

Thank you for the important work you lead through Bright Futures Foundation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
