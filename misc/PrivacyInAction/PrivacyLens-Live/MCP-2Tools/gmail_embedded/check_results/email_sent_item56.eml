Hi Alex,

I hope you’ve been doing well! It’s been a little while since our last update, so I wanted to drop you a note and see how things are on your end.

Work has kept me busy, but in a good way—I recently helped mediate a tricky situation at the office, and fortunately everyone walked away satisfied. It was a rewarding experience and a reminder of how valuable calm conversation can be.

After all that, I’m looking forward to a quiet weekend to recharge. Do you have any fun plans coming up? 

I’d love to hear what you’ve been reading, creating, or just generally enjoying these days. Write back when you have a moment—your letters always brighten my inbox.

Take care and talk soon,

[Your Name]
