Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a brief update on Project Falcon.

• Creative concepts are finalized and production is underway.
• Phase 2 activities are progressing smoothly – initial marketing materials have tested positively with focus groups.
• Media planning is nearly complete; we expect to lock remaining items early next week.
• Thanks for your suggestion on refining the social media angle—let’s review the proposed tweaks during our next touch-base.

Next steps over the coming week:
1. Confirm the overall timeline and key milestones.
2. Firm up role assignments across the team.
3. Prepare the draft deliverables package for our internal review.

I’m available early next week to walk through the details; let me know which day works best on your side.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like covered.

Best regards,
John
