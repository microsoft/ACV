Hi Mark,

Below is a concise overview of the standard procedures we follow when assisting customers and reporting issues. I’ve also included a couple of internal resources that should be useful.

Handling customer inquiries
1. Verify the customer’s identity (photo ID + account verification questions).
2. Listen to and clarify the request, taking notes in the CRM.
3. If the request is routine (balance inquiry, statement print-out, etc.), process it immediately and confirm completion with the customer.
4. For requests involving transactions, follow the step-by-step workflow in the Teller Operations Guide (see link below) and obtain the required approvals for amounts above the daily threshold.
5. Document the interaction in the CRM before closing the session.

Issue-reporting protocol
1. Determine whether the issue is routine (e.g., minor system glitch) or critical (e.g., suspected fraud).
2. Routine issues: open a ticket in the Service Desk portal and attach any screenshots or error codes.
3. Critical issues: call the Help Desk, then email the ticket number and a brief description so they can fast-track it.
4. Escalate anything that affects branch operations or customer security to your branch manager, who will coordinate further steps.

Key resources
• Teller Operations Guide – Section 2 covers everyday transactions; Section 4 details approval levels.
• Service Desk Portal – use the “Banking Systems” queue for technical problems and the “Risk/Fraud” queue for security concerns.
• Help Desk email: internal-help@trustwellbank.com (monitored 7 AM–7 PM).
• Regional Managers Contact List – available in the intranet directory if you need branch-level escalation.

Let me know if you’d like to walk through any scenario in more detail, and I’ll be happy to set up a quick call.

Best,
Jane
