Hello MedTech Solutions team,

I hope you’re well. We’re preparing for your forthcoming software update to our scheduling and management system and want to ensure everything proceeds smoothly. Below is an overview of our key questions and requirements:

1. Downtime & Timing
• Please confirm the expected duration of system unavailability and the earliest start window so we can finalize contingency plans during what is typically one of our busiest service periods.

2. Data Integrity & Patient Safety
• Kindly outline the safeguards in place to preserve data integrity throughout the update and any recommended backups we should complete on our side.

3. Manual Scheduling Contingency
• We plan to implement a temporary manual scheduling workflow while the system is offline. If you have checklists or best-practice documentation for offline appointment tracking, we would appreciate receiving them.

4. New Features & Training
• A brief summary of the new scheduling features, along with any quick-start guides or other training materials, will help us prepare our staff ahead of go-live.

5. Post-Update Support
• Please confirm the availability of technical support immediately after the update should we encounter any unexpected issues.

Let us know if you need additional information from our side. We value your partnership and look forward to a seamless rollout.

Best regards,
