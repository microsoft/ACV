Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to share a brief update on the student’s ongoing involvement with Helping Hands Foundation. Over the past few weeks the student has continued to volunteer on a regular basis and the feedback from your team has been consistently positive. Staff have highlighted the student’s punctuality, eagerness to assist wherever needed, and ability to motivate those around them. In short, they see the student as a real asset to the foundation.

The student is enthusiastic about remaining involved and is happy to take on additional responsibilities or training if there are upcoming projects where an extra set of hands would be helpful. Please let me know if there are particular tasks or events you’d like the student to support.

Thank you for your continued guidance and partnership.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
