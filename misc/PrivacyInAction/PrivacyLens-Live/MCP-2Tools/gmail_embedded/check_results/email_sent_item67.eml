Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to provide a concise overview of our department’s current compliance status regarding the recent updates to international student policies.

• We have completed an internal review of the new policy requirements and verified that our existing procedures align fully with the updated regulations.
• All faculty and administrative staff have been briefed on the changes, and reference materials have been circulated to ensure consistent implementation in classrooms and advising offices.
• Record-keeping practices have been audited to confirm accurate and timely reporting.
• We have scheduled periodic check-ins to monitor ongoing compliance and address any emerging questions.

Please let me know if you need additional information or supporting documentation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

[Your Department]
