Dear Mrs. Thompson,

Thank you for checking in about Ethan.

His absences earlier this week were related to a health-related matter that required a few appointments and some additional rest at home. He is recovering well and we expect him to return to class shortly.

Could you please let me know what classwork or assignments he missed so that we can help him get caught up before he is back in school? If there is anything else we should be aware of, please feel free to share.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,
Ms. Doe
