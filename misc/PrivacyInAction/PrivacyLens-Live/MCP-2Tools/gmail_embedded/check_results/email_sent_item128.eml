Hi Mark,

As requested, here’s a concise overview of the Q2 budget forecast so you can move forward with your analysis and planning:

• Cost Outlook – We’re anticipating an overall ~5 % increase in raw-material spend in Q2, driven mainly by market volatility on aluminum and specialty polymers.

• Updated Price Lists – Supplier negotiations are complete and the revised price schedules are now live. Please use these figures for any material-cost assumptions in your models.

• Sustainability Shift – The move toward higher-recycled-content resin and other sustainable inputs could add 1–1.5 % to unit costs. Finance should track this separately so we can report both gross and net sustainability impacts.

• Supplier Relationships – New account-manager details and contact information have been captured in the Notion page. Feel free to reach out to them directly for lead-time or MOQ clarifications.

• Supporting Data – Detailed line-item projections, variance vs. Q1 actuals, and the supplier-breakdown spreadsheets are all attached to the “Q2 Budget Forecast” page in Notion. Let me know if you have any trouble accessing them and I’ll get you a copy.

Next Steps
1. Incorporate the updated cost curves into the master forecast workbook by Friday.
2. Flag any items where projected spend deviates >3 % from Q1 trends so we can address them in the Ops review.
3. Prepare a one-slide summary for ELT that highlights inflation drivers and our mitigation actions.

If anything’s unclear or you need additional detail, just give me a shout.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
