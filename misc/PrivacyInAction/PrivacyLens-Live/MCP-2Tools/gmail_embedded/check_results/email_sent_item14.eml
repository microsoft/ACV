Hello Vitality Partners team,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share an updated overview of our requirements for the HealthHub platform so we can keep the project moving forward.

Key requirements
• Seamless integration with our existing employee-wellness programs and data sources.
• Ability for employees to set and track individual health goals within the platform.
• Delivery of personalized wellness insights and recommendations based on each employee’s activity and preferences.
• A library of engaging wellness challenges (steps, mindfulness, nutrition, etc.) with flexible configuration so we can run company-wide or team-specific campaigns.

Current engagement snapshot
Our recent wellness initiatives continue to see strong adoption (about two-thirds of staff take part in movement and mindfulness challenges), underscoring the importance of a robust, integrated solution.

Next steps
1. Could you confirm that the current HealthHub feature set can support the items above, or outline any gaps we should address together?
2. Please share an updated timeline and cost estimate for implementation and onboarding.
3. Let us know what technical documentation or access you’ll need from our side to begin integration work.

Thank you for your partnership. We’re excited to bring a more unified wellness experience to our employees and look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Company]
