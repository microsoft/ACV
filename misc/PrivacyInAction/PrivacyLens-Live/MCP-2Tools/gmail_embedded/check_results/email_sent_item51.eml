Dear Sunny Days families,

We’re excited to share a quick look at what your children have been up to this week:

• Collaborative Art Mural – The classroom has been buzzing with creativity! Each child added their own unique touches to a colorful group mural that celebrates teamwork and friendship. We hope you’ll enjoy seeing it displayed in the hallway.

• Buddy System Coming Soon – To continue strengthening peer connections, we’ll be launching a simple “Buddy System.” Children will be paired with a classmate for fun cooperative activities and gentle encouragement throughout the day. We’ll send more details in the next newsletter.

Thank you for your ongoing support. Have a wonderful weekend!

Warmly,
The Sunny Days Childcare Team
