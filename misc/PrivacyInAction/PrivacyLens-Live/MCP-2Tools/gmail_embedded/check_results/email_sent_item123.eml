Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the Global Tech Innovators Conference and diving into the latest tech trends together. As promised, here’s a quick recap along with a few additional thoughts:

• AI advancements – Generative AI models and predictive analytics are rapidly maturing and can help accelerate product ideation while streamlining internal workflows. I can share a couple of case studies that illustrate recent efficiency gains.

• Quantum computing – Although still early-stage, progress in error-correction and hybrid classical/quantum algorithms is opening doors for complex optimization tasks. This might be worth exploring via small-scale pilots for R&D planning.

• Blockchain applications – Beyond finance, permissioned ledgers are showing real traction in supply-chain traceability and data integrity. Tooling has improved markedly, lowering implementation barriers.

If any of these areas align with your current initiatives, let’s set up a brief call next week to discuss potential collaborations. Feel free to suggest a day/time that works for you, and I’ll make it work on my end.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best regards,
Jane
