Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m putting together a community sports program designed to engage local youth in a range of athletic activities that promote teamwork, discipline, and healthy lifestyles. Given the Active Youth Foundation’s outstanding track record of empowering young people through sport, I believe there’s a natural synergy between our organizations.

I’ve drafted a brief proposal that outlines the program’s goals, potential activities, and ways partners can contribute (coaching support, facilities access, joint fundraising, and community outreach). I’d love to share this with you and hear your thoughts on how we might collaborate.

Would you be available for a quick call or meeting next week to discuss possibilities? I’m flexible and happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering this. I’m excited about the potential impact we could have together and look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
