Hi Michael,

I hope you’re doing well. Here are the most recent status notes on the three joint cases we’re tracking together:

• Case 001 – Housing: The family has been placed in stable housing. Ongoing support visits are scheduled, but the core housing need is now resolved.

• Case 002 – Food Assistance: The family has been successfully enrolled in the food-assistance program. We’ll keep an eye on utilization and provide guidance during the first month.

• Case 003 – Medical Aid: The family’s application for medical aid is currently under review by the agency. We expect to hear initial feedback within the next couple of weeks; I’ll update you as soon as we receive it.

Please let me know if you need any additional details or if there are action items on your end.

Thank you for your continued partnership.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
