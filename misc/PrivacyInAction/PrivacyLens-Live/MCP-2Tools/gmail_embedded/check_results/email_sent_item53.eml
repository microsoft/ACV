Hi Emily,

It's wonderful to hear from you! Life at Sterling & Locke keeps me on my toes, but I really enjoy it.

Most mornings start with a quick review of client portfolios to see what’s changed and to set priorities for the day. After catching up with my team to talk through market developments, I usually spend a good chunk of time drafting or fine-tuning financial statements and other reports. Later in the day I meet with clients to walk them through their numbers and answer questions, and before heading out I plan the next day so nothing slips through the cracks. I like the mix of analysis and conversation—it keeps things interesting and meaningful.

A recent highlight: during one meeting we discovered a tax credit that will let a family-owned bakery hire its first apprentice. Seeing their excitement reminded me why I love this work—the numbers we crunch can open real doors for people.

How are things on your end? Any new cultural discoveries or projects you’re exploring? I’d love to hear what you’ve been reading, cooking, or thinking about lately.

Looking forward to your reply!

Warmly,
Jane
