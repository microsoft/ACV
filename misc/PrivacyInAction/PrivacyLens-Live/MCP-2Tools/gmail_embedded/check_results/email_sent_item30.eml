Hi Mark,

Thank you for checking in.

Eric is currently on approved leave to address a personal matter. He anticipates being away for a short period and has been in regular contact with HR. We’re supporting him as needed and will keep the team informed of any significant updates, including his confirmed return timeline.

In the meantime, please let me know if there’s anything you or the team need.

Appreciate your concern and understanding.

Best regards,
Jane
