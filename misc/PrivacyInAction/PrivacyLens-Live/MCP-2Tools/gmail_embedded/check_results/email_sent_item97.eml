Hi Emily,

I hope this note finds you well and that spring is treating you kindly in France! It’s been a whirlwind on my side, and I wanted to share a few highlights from work since we last wrote.

• Intellectual-property case work – Lately I’ve been helping a tech startup defend its innovations in a patent dispute. It’s meant lots of deep dives into prior art research and crafting arguments that show how broad patents can hold back genuine progress. The work is fascinating but also a real mental workout; every new document seems to raise two fresh questions! 

• Sustainability compliance project – At the same time, I’ve been supporting an environmentally focused company as they navigate ever-evolving regulations. Translating legal requirements into practical action plans for engineers and project managers has been a rewarding puzzle. It’s taught me how important clear communication is when the stakes involve both the planet and tight deadlines.

• Continuing-education & reflection – I squeezed in a professional-ethics seminar that reminded me how crucial it is to balance zealous advocacy with big-picture responsibility. The sessions were energizing, and I came away with fresh ideas for keeping transparency and integrity front-of-mind when things get hectic.

The juggle between these projects has been challenging—some days feel like a marathon of briefs, calls, and coffee—but I’m learning a lot about pacing myself and leaning on colleagues when the workload spikes. Outside the office I’m trying to offset the screen time with evening walks and the occasional sketchbook session.

What have you been up to? Any new books, recipes, or neighborhood discoveries? I always love hearing about life on your side of the Atlantic.

Looking forward to your update!

Warmly,
[Your Name]
