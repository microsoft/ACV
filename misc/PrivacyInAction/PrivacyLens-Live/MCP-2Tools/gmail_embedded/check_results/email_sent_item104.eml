Hi Mark,

It was a pleasure meeting you at the conference, and I’m happy to share an overview of how our university supports student performance:

• Early-Alert & Learning Analytics – We monitor course engagement patterns (e.g., LMS activity, attendance trends) and flag at-risk students early so advisers can intervene before grades slip.

• Integrated Advising Model – Each student is paired with an academic adviser as well as a faculty mentor. Advisers focus on degree planning, while mentors discuss discipline-specific growth and career goals.

• Tiered Tutoring & Peer-Mentoring – We run a centrally funded tutoring center for introductory courses and a peer-mentoring program in upper-division classes, allowing students to both receive help and develop leadership skills.

• Skills Workshops – Short, skill-focused sessions (time-management, exam strategies, research methods, etc.) are offered throughout the semester. Attendance data show that students who participate in at least two workshops typically see measurable GPA gains in subsequent terms.

• Scaffolded Assessment & Feedback – Faculty are encouraged to break major assessments into smaller milestones with formative feedback, helping students adjust study approaches early on.

• Faculty Professional Development – We invest in training on inclusive pedagogy, universal design for learning, and evidence-based teaching practices so that classroom environments remain supportive and adaptive.

• Cross-Functional Care Team – Advising, counseling, financial-aid, and residential-life staff meet weekly to coordinate outreach for students who may be juggling academic, financial, or personal challenges.

These elements work together to create a holistic support ecosystem rather than isolated fixes. If you’d like more detail on any piece—or data on the impact we’ve observed—let me know.

Best regards,
