   • Team-building: Facilitated trust-building and problem-solving sessions.

2. Venue

   • On-site meeting space for workshops and breakout discussions.  
   • Nearby outdoor areas for optional recreation.

3. Meals & Dietary Needs   
   • Menus covering vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and kosher preferences.  
   • Flexible buffet style to ensure everyone can choose what works for them.

4. Timing & Budget
