Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to share a brief update on our joint health initiative:

• We’ve achieved roughly 70% of our first-quarter milestones, and participation from the community continues to grow.
• Volunteer training sessions are underway, ensuring our team is well-prepared for upcoming outreach activities.
• Over the next six months we plan to broaden our reach in underserved areas, secure additional funding, and formalize collaborations with local health professionals.

Could you let me know if there are any updates on budget or resource allocations from your side? I’m happy to send over the latest action plan and training materials or set up a quick call to review details.

Thanks for your continued partnership. I’m encouraged by the momentum we’re building together.

Best regards,
John
