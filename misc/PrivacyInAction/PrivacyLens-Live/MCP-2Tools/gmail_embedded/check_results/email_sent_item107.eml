Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out. Below is a concise overview of our most recent donor-engagement metrics that should help inform plans for our next joint initiative:

• Participation: Donor participation rose by roughly 15% over the same period last year, with the strongest lift during the latest giving season.
• Conversion: A targeted email series to previous supporters achieved about a 20% conversion rate.
• Growth trend: Both the donor base and total contributions have continued an upward trajectory for the past three years, driven largely by personalized outreach and matching-gift promotions.
• Top-performing tactics:
  – Personalized thank-you messages paired with impact stories.
  – Limited-time matching-gift challenges.
  – Social-media micro-campaigns spotlighting specific program outcomes.

Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any of these areas or set up time to brainstorm how we can integrate these findings into our upcoming campaign.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
John
