Dear Mr. Harrison,

I hope you are doing well. I have always valued the guidance you provided during our time working together, and I am reaching out to seek your perspective on a matter I am currently handling (Case #112233).

In particular, I would appreciate your thoughts on how best to position our evidence and refine our overall strategy as key deadlines approach. If you have some time over the next week or so, I would be grateful for a brief call or any written suggestions you might be willing to share.

Thank you in advance for your time and expertise. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
