Dear CodeCrafters Team,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the upcoming software upgrade. We are eager to move forward and appreciate your support in making this transition smooth.

Current environment (high-level):
• Centralised database that runs on a legacy application layer handling all customer transactions and data storage.
• Key goals for the upgrade are strengthened security controls, faster transaction processing, and easier future scalability.
• Minimal service interruption is essential; continuity for core banking functions must be maintained during cut-over.

Initial requirements & considerations:
1. Security – alignment with the latest industry standards (data-at-rest encryption, enhanced access logging, regular patching workflow).
2. Performance – at least a 30-40 % improvement in average transaction throughput and lower peak-time latency.
3. Compatibility – smooth integration with our existing data schema and downstream reporting tools.
4. Roll-back plan – a clearly documented contingency in case of unexpected issues during deployment.

Availability: I am free for a brief coordination call late this week or early next week. Please suggest a convenient window that works for your team.

If there is any pre-call information or documentation you would like us to prepare, just let me know.

Looking forward to collaborating on this project.

Best regards,
John
