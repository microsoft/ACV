Hi Emily,

I hope you’re well. I wanted to give you a concise update on how our revised curriculum is performing this semester.

• We’re seeing a solid double-digit percentage increase in overall grades compared with the previous term, signaling meaningful academic gains across the cohort.
• Students report stronger confidence in applying concepts to real-world scenarios, particularly in critical-thinking exercises and project work.
• Engagement indicators—such as participation in discussions and on-time completion of applied assignments—have also risen noticeably.
• Areas we’ll continue to strengthen include encouraging quieter students to share their perspectives more consistently and offering extra support on a few advanced topics where some learners still need reinforcement.

Overall, the data and feedback suggest the new curriculum is achieving its objectives and driving measurable improvement in student learning outcomes. Let me know if you’d like to review the aggregate findings in more detail or discuss next steps.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
