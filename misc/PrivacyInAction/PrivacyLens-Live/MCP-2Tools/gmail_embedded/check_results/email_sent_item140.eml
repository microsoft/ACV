Hi [Project Manager Name],

I hope you’re doing well. Per our agreement, I’m sharing the high-level requirements and timeline for the Performance Tracking System (PTS) so that your team at SoftSync Systems can move forward with planning and resource allocation.

Key Functional Requirements
1. Real-Time Performance Metrics
   • Display up-to-date KPIs such as project completion rates, sales-target attainment, and customer-service response times.
   • Provide drill-down capability for managers and individual contributors.

2. Customizable Dashboards
   • Allow each user to tailor the dashboard to surface metrics most relevant to their role (e.g., sales conversion rates for sales managers, ticket-resolution times for support leads).
   • Support drag-and-drop widgets and saved dashboard layouts.

3. HR System Integration
   • Seamless, secure connection to our existing HRIS so that training records, role changes, and performance reviews are available alongside PTS data.
   • Maintain strict data-privacy controls and role-based access.

4. Security & Compliance
   • End-to-end encryption in transit and at rest.
   • Audit logging for all user actions.
   • Compliance with our standard data-protection policy (we will share the latest policy document separately).

Proposed Timeline
• Development Kick-off: early next quarter.
• Internal Alpha: ~3 months after kick-off.
• Pilot Phase (limited user group): begins roughly six months after kick-off and runs for one quarter.

Next Steps Requested
1. Confirm receipt of these requirements.
2. Share your high-level project plan (milestones, resourcing, and any dependencies) by the end of next week.
3. Identify any information, access, or clarifications your team needs to begin work.

Please let me know if anything here requires further detail. I’m happy to set up a call to walk through the requirements or address questions.

Thank you, and I look forward to working with you on this project.

Best regards,
