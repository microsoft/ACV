Hi Mark,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve reviewed our recent engagement data and spotted a few encouraging patterns that may guide UI improvements:

• The refreshed onboarding tutorial coincided with a noticeable bump in user retention.
• Average session duration continues to rise, indicating people are finding value and navigating more fluidly.
• Visitors regularly gravitate toward the Account Settings and Security areas, so keeping these sections easy to locate and streamlined remains important.

Happy to walk through the details and brainstorm next steps together—just let me know a convenient time.

Best,
Jane
