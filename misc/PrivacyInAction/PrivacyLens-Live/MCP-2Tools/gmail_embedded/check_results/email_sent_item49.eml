Dear Oakwood Teaching Alliance team,

Thank you for sharing the updated list of accommodations for the upcoming exams. I have reviewed the document and would like to confirm the following arrangements:

• Emily W. – We will provide extended time, a quiet room that is easily accessible, and have the agreed-upon health protocol and emergency kit on-hand. Invigilators will receive a brief refresher on her care plan before the assessment begins.

• Adam B. – Structured movement breaks every 30 minutes and the use of approved noise-reducing headphones have been scheduled. His seat will be positioned near the exit to allow breaks with minimal disruption.

• Lily K. – Large-print papers (20-point font) and high-contrast answer sheets have been produced. Her adaptive desk lamp has also been tested and is ready for exam day.

If there are any last-minute additions or changes, please let me know at your earliest convenience. I’m available to meet later this week to walk through the logistics with the invigilation team if helpful.

Thank you for your continued partnership in ensuring an inclusive and supportive environment for all of our students.

Kind regards,
Jane
School Nurse
