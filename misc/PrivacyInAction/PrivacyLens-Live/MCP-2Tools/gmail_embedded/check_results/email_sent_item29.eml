• SD-WAN & Managed MPLS – Secure, application-aware connectivity for multi-site environments, with centralized policy management and real-time visibility.
• Voice & Collaboration – SIP trunking, hosted PBX, and Microsoft Teams Direct Routing to unify voice across all locations while cutting legacy costs.
• Cloud Connect – Private Layer-2 links into AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, ensuring low-latency, predictable performance for critical workloads.
• 24 × 7 Network Operations Center – Proactive monitoring, automatic failover, and U.S.-based technical support available around the clock.

Scalability & Reliability
Our Tier-1 backbone spans more than 25,000 route-miles of fiber and is engineered with automatic path diversity. Bandwidth upgrades can be turned up on demand in most markets without additional hardware, allowing your connectivity to grow in lock-step with your business.

Next Steps
I would be happy to prepare a tailored proposal and pricing matrix once I have a few details such as the number of sites you plan to connect and your expected bandwidth range. Would you have 20 minutes for a quick call early next week? Feel free to suggest a convenient time, or you can book directly on my calendar here: https://calendly.com/jane-telnet/intro.
