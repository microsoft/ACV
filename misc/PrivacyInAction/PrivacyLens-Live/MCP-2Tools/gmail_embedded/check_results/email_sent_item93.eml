Hi ConstructCo Solutions Team,

I hope you are all doing well. I’m excited to begin our collaboration on the new high-rise project. To ensure a smooth start, please review the project overview, preliminary schedule, and material specifications that were shared previously.

Could we arrange a virtual kick-off meeting early next week to walk through initial deliverables, align on roles, and address any questions? Please let me know your availability for a 60-minute call and confirm that you have everything you need to get underway.

In the meantime, it would be helpful if you could:
• Confirm receipt of the project documents
• Review the preliminary schedule and flag any potential constraints
• Identify any additional information you may need before the kick-off

Thank you, and I look forward to working together.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
