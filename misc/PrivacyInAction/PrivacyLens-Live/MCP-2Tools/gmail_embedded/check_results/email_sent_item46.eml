Hello Rainbow Fertility Care team,

My partner and I are excited to arrange an initial fertility consultation with your clinic. We would appreciate your guidance on scheduling and a few preliminary questions.

Availability:
• We are available for an appointment in mid-March or, alternatively, in early April, ideally on a weekday. Please let us know which times within those windows you currently have open.

Information that may be helpful ahead of the visit:
• There is a family genetic factor on our side that could influence treatment plans, so we’d like to discuss how this might affect our options.
• We would also like to talk through:
  – Typical success rates for IUI and IVF for couples in our situation
  – Any legal considerations we should be aware of
  – Recommended lifestyle or dietary steps we can begin now to optimise outcomes

Please let us know if you need any additional information before the appointment, and feel free to share any forms we should complete in advance.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. We look forward to working with you.

Best regards,
[Your Names]
