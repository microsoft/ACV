Dear Mr. Harrison,

As requested, please find below an overview of InnoTech Solutions’ corporate compliance policies and the main elements presently in force:

1. Governance & Code of Conduct
   • Company-wide Code of Conduct that sets standards for ethics, integrity, and professional behaviour.
   • Annual acknowledgment required from all employees and officers.

2. Anti-Corruption & Fair-Competition Controls
   • Zero-tolerance policy toward bribery or facilitation payments.
   • Mandatory third-party due-diligence before engaging agents, distributors, or consultants.

3. Financial Reporting & Record-Keeping
   • Internal controls aligned with relevant accounting regulations to ensure complete and accurate books and records.
   • Quarterly internal audits to verify adherence to documentation protocols.

4. Training & Awareness
   • Core compliance curriculum for all staff upon onboarding and refresher modules every year.
   • Specialised training for high-risk functions such as sales, procurement, and finance.

5. Whistle-Blower & Investigation Process
   • Confidential reporting channels (hotline and web portal) managed by an independent third party.
   • Non-retaliation guarantee and structured investigation workflow overseen by Compliance and Internal Audit.

6. Risk Assessment & Monitoring
   • Enterprise-wide compliance risk assessment carried out annually, with results reviewed by senior leadership.
   • Key risk indicators tracked monthly; findings presented to the Audit & Compliance Committee.

7. Continuous Improvement
   • Recent audits highlighted three focus areas: documentation consistency, targeted training for new hires, and updates to certain legacy IT systems. Action plans are underway, and progress is reviewed at each committee meeting.

If you require the full policy manuals or additional supporting documents, please let me know and I will be happy to forward them promptly.
