Dear Mark,

Thank you for reaching out. Below is a concise, broadly applicable overview of the approach we typically take when preparing and filing motions in state court. I’ve kept the points general so they can be adapted to a variety of matters and venues.

1. Confirm the controlling rules and deadlines
   • Review the pertinent rules of civil procedure and any local rules to verify timing, word-count/page limits, and formatting requirements.
   • Check for standing orders or chambers guidelines that may impose additional obligations (e.g., courtesy copies, electronic filing nuances).

2. Identify and satisfy any pre-motion requirements
   • Determine whether the court requires a pre-motion conference, meet-and-confer certification, or letter briefing before a formal motion is accepted.
   • Document these efforts so they can be referenced in the filing.

3. Assemble supporting materials early
   • Collect affidavits, exhibits, and transcripts while drafting so citations are accurate and page references are final.
   • Prepare a concise proposed order if the judge’s practice preferences encourage or require one.

4. Draft with the record and standard of review in mind
   • Keep the statement of facts tightly linked to admissible portions of the record.
   • Frame arguments around the precise standard the court will apply (e.g., “good cause,” “excusable neglect,” “failure to state a claim”) and lead with the strongest ground.

5. Formatting and readability
   • Use clear headings that track each element of the rule or test.
   • Add a short introduction summarizing the requested relief and a conclusion specifying exactly what order you want entered.
   • Double-check that all citations conform to Bluebook or the local equivalent.

6. Filing logistics
   • Confirm electronic filing portal requirements (PDF bookmarks, OCR, maximum file sizes).
   • File exhibits as separate attachments when possible for easier judicial review.
   • Serve all parties promptly and retain proof of service.

7. Post-filing follow-up
   • Calendar the response deadline and any anticipated reply date.
   • Monitor the docket for minute entries or deficiency notices and cure promptly.

8. Internal quality control
   • Conduct a peer or supervisor review before filing—fresh eyes often catch citation or record missteps.
   • Maintain a central checklist so future motions follow the same quality standard.

I hope these points give you a solid framework. Let me know if you would like to discuss any item in more depth, and I’m happy to chat.

Best regards,
Jane
