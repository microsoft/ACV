Hi Selection Syndicate Team,

I wanted to share a brief update on the latest round of candidate assessments:

• All interviews and technical exercises have been completed and documented.
• We have identified key strengths and areas for growth for each candidate.
• Michael Turner in particular demonstrated strong proficiency with Python and Java and excelled in the complex problem-solving exercises—he is well-suited for roles focused on backend architecture and analytical work.
• Recommended next steps include scheduling final-round interviews with the top performers and initiating reference checks.

Please let me know if you would like any additional details or access to the full assessment summaries.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
