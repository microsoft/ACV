Hi Mark,

I hope you’re doing well. As promised, here are a few practical strategies you can experiment with over the coming days. Feel free to keep the ones that feel helpful and set aside anything that doesn’t quite fit.

1. Five-Minute Mindful Breathing
   • Find a quiet spot, sit comfortably, and focus on the natural rhythm of your breath for about five minutes.
   • If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breathing. 
   • Try this once in the morning and once in the late afternoon.

2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)
   • Starting at your feet and moving upward, tense each muscle group for 5–7 seconds, then release for 15–20 seconds.
   • Notice the contrast between tension and relaxation. A short PMR session before bed can signal your body that it’s time to unwind.

3. Micro-Break Movement
   • Set a timer to stand, stretch, or walk for two minutes every hour or so.  
   • Simple movements (shoulder rolls, neck stretches, light walking) help reset posture and reduce cumulative tension.

4. Daily Physical Activity
   • Aim for roughly 20–30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days—brisk walking, cycling, or a short workout video all count.
   • Regular movement supports mood, energy, and overall stress recovery.

5. ‘Digital Sunset’ Routine
   • Choose an evening time to step away from screens and transition into wind-down mode.
   • Use that time for a relaxing activity—reading, journaling, or listening to music—so your mind has space to shift out of work mode.

6. Quick Grounding Technique (Box Breathing)
   • Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4; repeat for 4–6 cycles whenever you notice stress rising.

Feel free to let me know which of these feel manageable or if you’d like to adjust anything. Small, consistent steps often add up to meaningful change.

Take care,
[Your Name]
