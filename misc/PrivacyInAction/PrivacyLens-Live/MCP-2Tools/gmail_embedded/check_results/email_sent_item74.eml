Hi Alex,

I wanted to share a quick status update on our project:

• The traffic-flow dataset from last quarter was sent to you last week and the initial review is underway.
• Our next phase is to integrate that data with the existing efficiency models so we can locate key bottlenecks and start outlining solution options.
• We aim to have a draft of the proposed improvements ready for our upcoming research paper.

Could we schedule a brief call early next week to discuss initial insights and align on responsibilities for this phase? Let me know what works for you.

Thanks, and talk soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
