Hello Alex,

Thank you for reaching out with your questions about our child protective services (CPS) work. Below is a concise overview of our standard procedures and the primary challenges our team currently faces.

CPS Procedural Overview
1. Intake & Screening – Each report is logged and screened to determine urgency and jurisdiction.
2. Immediate Safety Assessment – When a situation is deemed high-risk, a worker conducts an in-person safety check, typically within hours of the report.
3. Full Investigation – The assigned caseworker gathers statements, reviews records, and collaborates with schools, medical professionals, and law enforcement where appropriate.
4. Case Planning – If risk is confirmed, we develop a safety plan that can involve in-home services, temporary kinship care, or—when necessary—court-ordered removal.
5. Ongoing Monitoring & Services – Families receive support (parent coaching, counseling, substance-use treatment, etc.) while workers track progress toward safety goals.
6. Case Closure or Legal Action – When safety benchmarks are met, the case is closed; if they are not, we pursue additional court involvement or permanency planning.

Key Operational Challenges
• High Caseloads – Front-line staff often manage 30+ open cases, which strains response times and depth of engagement.
• Resource Constraints – Foster placements, specialized treatment programs, and language-specific services are in limited supply, complicating service delivery.
• Emotional Toll on Staff – Constant exposure to trauma can lead to burnout and turnover, further affecting caseload distribution.

To address these obstacles, we are expanding staff training, piloting mobile intake technology to streamline documentation, and actively advocating for increased funding and community partnerships.

I’m glad to clarify any point or provide additional context should you need it for your reporting.

Best regards,
Communications Team
Haven Child Welfare Agency
