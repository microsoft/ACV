Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to share a few story angles that showcase the positive impact of Greenfield University alumni:

• Community Champion – Marcus Antonelli: A long-time volunteer with several local non-profits, Marcus recently delivered an inspiring keynote at our alumni gathering on the power of service and resilience. His work continues to mobilize volunteers and raise awareness for community initiatives.

• Alumni Volunteer Network: Over the past year, graduates have organized mentoring sessions for students, monthly food-bank drives, and neighborhood clean-ups. These efforts highlight the strong service culture within our alumni community.

• Event Spotlight: Our recent alumni forum featured a panel on social entrepreneurship where graduates discussed using their professional skills to address social challenges. The panel received excellent feedback and sparked collaborations that are already taking shape.

Please let me know if you’d like additional details, quotes, or images to accompany any of these highlights.

Warm regards,
John
Alumni Relations Coordinator
Greenfield University
