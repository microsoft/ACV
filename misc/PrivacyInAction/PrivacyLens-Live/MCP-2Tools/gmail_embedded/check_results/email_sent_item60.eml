Dear Oakwood Alumni Reunion Committee,

I hope you are all doing well. I’m writing to share a concise update based on the most recent information in our Alumni Tracker.

Class of 2005
• Several members have stepped into senior leadership roles across marketing, architecture, and legal sectors.
• A number of alumni have also received national recognition for creative and philanthropic work, including literary honors.
• Many of these accomplishments will be highlighted during the Oakwood Charity Gala planned for mid-June.

Class of 2010
• The cohort continues to excel, with one alumnus founding a technology start-up that has already secured significant investment.
• A fellow classmate’s education-focused non-profit has expanded its programs to multiple new regions abroad.
• Others have recently been appointed to executive positions in finance and pharmaceutical research.

Key Reminders
• Applications for the Oakwood Alumni Scholarship close at the end of April.
• Please let me know if you would like any of these highlights featured in reunion materials or shared on official channels.

Thank you for your continued dedication to fostering our vibrant alumni community. I’m happy to provide additional details as needed.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
