Hi Mark,

Great to hear from you! I’m excited that you’re putting together something special for Alex.

• Timing: Alex usually has a couple of mid-week evenings free, so targeting one of those should make it easier for him to attend without work conflicts.  
• Venue: Rather than using his place, we might pick a relaxed spot nearby where friends can gather comfortably and it stays off his radar. If you have a location in mind, let me know and I can help coordinate.
• Gift idea: I’ve been thinking that a rugged smartwatch geared toward first-responders would suit him perfectly—practical for the field and a nice reminder of our appreciation for his work.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed and what you need from me. Happy to help with invitations, decorations, or anything else.

Cheers,
Jane
