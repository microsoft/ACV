Hi Sarah,

I hope you're well. I wanted to share a short update on two individuals in our care who could benefit from Helping Hands' services:

• An older adult who is recovering from recent surgery would appreciate assistance with transportation to and from her physical-therapy appointments.

• Another individual is experiencing increased social isolation and would greatly benefit from regular companionship visits or phone check-ins.

If your team has availability to help, please let me know and I can share any additional details needed to coordinate the support.

Thank you for everything you and your team do.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
