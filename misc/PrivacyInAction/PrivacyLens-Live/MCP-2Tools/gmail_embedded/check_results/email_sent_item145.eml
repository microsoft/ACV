Dear Professor Harrison,

Thank you for reaching out with your question about how we foster student engagement. Below is a concise overview of the approaches that have worked well in my courses this term:

• Opening “ice-breaker” questions – I begin each session with a brief, thought-provoking prompt that connects the day’s topic to current events. Students arrive prepared to discuss and it sets an energetic tone.

• Real-world applications – Wherever possible I pair theoretical material with case studies drawn from industry reports, news articles, or community examples. Students consistently report that these links make abstract concepts feel tangible.

• Student-led segments – Small groups sign up to lead 10-minute portions of class discussion. This gives them ownership of the material and tends to raise the overall level of dialogue.

• Quick feedback loops – Anonymous one-minute “exit tickets” at the end of class tell me what resonated and what needs clarification. I address common questions at the start of the next meeting so students see their feedback put to use right away.

• Optional low-stakes practice – Short, ungraded quizzes on the learning platform help students self-check understanding and keep pace without the pressure of formal assessment.

Observed impact
Without sharing individual results, I can say that attendance has remained strong and voluntary participation has noticeably increased since implementing these strategies. Several students have also remarked in written reflections that the student-led segments, in particular, made them feel more invested in the course.

Next steps
I am happy to compare notes in more detail or pilot a joint activity across our sections if that would be useful. Please let me know what you have in mind, and I would be glad to collaborate.
