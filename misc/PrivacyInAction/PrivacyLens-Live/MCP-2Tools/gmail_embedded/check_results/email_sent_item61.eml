Hi Maria,

I wanted to share a brief status update:

• The next series of Immigrant Aid Society workshops has been finalized and is planned for early March. Feel free to distribute the schedule as you see fit.

• Registration for the upcoming legal clinic has now reached full capacity. Could you please help make sure community members who are attending are prepared?

Thanks for your continued support! Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
John
