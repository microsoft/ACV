   • Your experience scaling early-stage positions into significant holdings would broaden the scope and impact of our joint initiatives.

3. Structured Approach to Collaboration
   • Establish clear, shared objectives for target returns and impact.
   • Align due-diligence frameworks to streamline decision making.
   • Schedule regular touchpoints to review performance and adjust strategy.

4. Next Steps
   • I would welcome an introductory call at your convenience to refine joint goals and outline an actionable roadmap. If agreeable, please suggest a time window that works for you in the coming weeks.

I am confident that our combined expertise can create meaningful value for both sides, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.
