Hi Emily,

It was nice meeting you recently! As promised, here are a few take-aways from my creative writing class that I thought you might enjoy:

•  Sensory layering – starting a scene by anchoring the reader in one strong sense (sound of rain, scent of coffee, etc.) and then weaving in two others tends to pull the audience in faster than a straight visual description.

•  "Show, then tell" – we practiced letting a subtle action or detail imply the emotion before naming it. For example, instead of writing "She was nervous," having her trace the rim of her glass until fingerprints smudge says more with fewer words.

•  Dialogue compression – trimming small talk and slipping exposition into subtext keeps conversations lively. Our instructor had us remove one line from every exchange; almost nothing felt missing afterward.

•  Revision as excavation – on the second draft, we looked for the single paragraph that held the story’s pulse and rewrote the rest of the piece around it. Painful but effective!

•  Creative constraints – giving ourselves limits (100-word micro-scene, all one-syllable words, etc.) sparked surprising solutions when we returned to regular prose.

If you ever want to trade drafts or brainstorm story ideas, let me know—always happy to swap inspiration.

Happy writing,
[Your Name]
