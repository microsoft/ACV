Dear Brother Michael,

I hope you are doing well. I’m reaching out to see if we might coordinate a bit of practical support for Tom as he prepares for several upcoming job interviews.

Specifically, he could really use a suit and a pair of dress shoes in good condition so that he can present himself confidently. If Light of Hope—or anyone in your network—has access to a clothing closet, donations, or funds that could help, I would be grateful to explore options together.

Tom’s interviews are approaching soon, so any assistance within the next week would make a meaningful difference. Please let me know if there are forms to complete, an appointment we should schedule, or other steps we should take. I’m happy to facilitate logistics or pick up items as needed.

Thank you very much for your continued support and generosity.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
