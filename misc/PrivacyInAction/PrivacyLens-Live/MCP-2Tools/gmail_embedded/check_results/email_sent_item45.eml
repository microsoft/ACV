Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for reaching out and for the kind words about my advocacy work. I’m honored by the invitation to contribute to Vital Voices and would be delighted to collaborate.

I’m comfortable sharing my personal journey with your readers in whichever format best suits your editorial needs. Please let me know whether you prefer a written piece or an interview, along with any word-count guidance, deadlines, or stylistic considerations. If an interview is preferred, feel free to propose a few convenient time slots and the platform you like to use.

I look forward to working together to inform and inspire the community.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
