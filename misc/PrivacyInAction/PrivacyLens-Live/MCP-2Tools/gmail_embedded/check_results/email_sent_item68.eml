Hi Sarah,

I hope you’ve been well! I wanted to share a quick update on the new admissions cycle.

This year we’ve seen a notable rise in interest, resulting in our most competitive applicant pool to date. The incoming class is academically outstanding and represents a broader range of backgrounds than ever before, with students joining us from across the globe.

We’re excited about the energy this next cohort will bring to campus and look forward to the year ahead.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like more details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
