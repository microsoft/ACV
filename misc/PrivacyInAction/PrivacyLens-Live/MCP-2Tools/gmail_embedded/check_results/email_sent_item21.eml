Hi Alex,

I wanted to share some thoughts on your recent project.

• Your data analysis is thorough and clearly demonstrates a solid grasp of the course concepts. The visualizations you chose make your findings easy to follow and help strengthen your overall argument.

• To make the paper even sharper, consider tightening your hypothesis into a single, concise statement. A focused hypothesis will make it easier for the reader to see exactly what question you are answering and how your analysis supports that answer.

• As you revise, you might also double-check that each section of the paper explicitly links back to that streamlined hypothesis. A brief sign-posting sentence at the start of key sections can guide the reader and underscore the logical flow of your argument.

• Finally, a quick pass for wording and transitions will ensure the paper reads smoothly from start to finish.

Overall, you have produced a strong piece of work — a few small refinements will make it even more compelling.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to discuss further.

Best,
[Your Name]
