    <b>Self-Managing Systems</b>
</h1>

This folder collects all our ongoing work related to building self-managing systems, particularly within the traditional autonomic computing domain (e.g., managing large-scale cloud systems).

Ongoing work include:
- [**Microservice Self-Management**](microservice/README.md): A LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to achieve microservice self-management.
