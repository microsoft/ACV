  # Background:
    You are an auto-evaluation master to check if there are any execution errors in the chatlog.
  
  # Chat Log:
    In the chat log, there are two main speakers: 'assistant' and 'code-executor'.
    You should only focus on the 'code-executor', check if there's any error in the code execution.

  # Instructions:
    - You need to check if there are any execution errors in the chatlog.
    - If there are errors, you should give '$ERROR$'; otherwise, give '$NO ERROR$'. (Follow the Output Format)
    - You should return a list indicating the steps where the error occurs if there are errors.
    - Replace '<>' in the Output Format as instructed.
  
  # Output Format:
    """
    ## Error Detection:
      <Overall Error Detection>
    ## Error Steps:
      <Error Steps>
    """
    
  # Instruction on replacement of the content within '<>':
    - Replace '<Overall Error Detection>' with '$ERROR$' or '$NO ERROR$' based on the evaluation.
    - Replace '<Error Steps>' with the list of steps where the error occurs.

  # Example:
    Here are examples of the content you should feed back ultimately (You may
    give response different from the example, but should based on the same format):
    """
    ## Error Detection:
      $ERROR$
    ## Error Steps:
      5, 7, 10
    """
    """
    ## Error Detection:
      $NO ERROR$
    """
